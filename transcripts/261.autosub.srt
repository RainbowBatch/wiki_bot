00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Jordan

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
Been awhile it has been a while

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
It was pretty good

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,440
Austin

7
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,888
Alex Alex

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
MyTouch and then just like cancel each other out like matter and anti-matter I kind of had a realization when I was down there that like

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
Cancel run into him somewhere

10
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Like you might be arrested by Steven Seagal

11
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
Fun

12
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
My parents take me down to the hike-and-bike Trail Apartments

13
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:19,872
Sneak away like also most of the time that I was there

14
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Was the time that he was on air

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
Try try try

16
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
I should backup

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,144
When I arrived my mom had an idea for something that you wanted to go to

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
Yes okay what you want to do it heard about this

19
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Performance

20
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
Called acro-cats

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
I did I was

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
I didn't want to know anything about it

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,352
Positive reinforcement

24
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,216
Already suspicious suspicious

25
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,544
There's a cat stand

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
Well we got kind of got to do

27
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
If it's bad it's great if it's great on Tuesday night

28
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Knight of acro-cats

29
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
Opening night opening night in Austin

30
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,424
I don't want it I don't want to disparage anybody's life's work

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Or anything like that

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
But I would say going to this

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Performance first of all

34
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
She comes out the embassy comes out

35
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
And her

36
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
She does not have what I would call performing

37
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Chops

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
H-E-B cat trainer

39
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,928
Yes a person who spends all her time training cats just

40
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Not have a great

41
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
You know that feeling

42
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
Host comes out of the comedy show

43
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
A lot of children

44
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Couple of like stray adult

45
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Like maybe 20-somethings drinking booze

46
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,696
There was a small part of my brain that thought this is actually going to be framed

47
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
Eddie Woodstock

48
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
But her show was kind of supposed to be a demonstration of her training

49
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Which involves

50
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
The clicker and then positive reinforcement likes give the cats

51
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,640
Chicken or whatever so wasn't just a it wasn't like that

52
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Now

53
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
I apologize for

54
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Image is legit

55
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
A bunch of cats

56
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Like holding instruments

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
And doing s***

58
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
All together with no interference if you would a Playa. And my off on you

59
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Abandon a minute

60
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
Little do you know

61
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,335
Coronavirus

62
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
5 minutes hour and a half

63
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Too long

64
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Too long

65
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,463
The first I would say our in 10 of it was the cat's coming out individually

66
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
From one pedestal to another or like there was a little shopping cart and a cat with

67
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
Push it

68
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
It was fine

69
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,311
Simple

70
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
To do

71
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
And most

72
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
Most is tough

73
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
A lot of the time

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Seattle

75
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
It was a demonstration that this stuff is very

76
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
Yeah probably

77
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
Recorder

78
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
20%

79
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
25% of the time to cats

80
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Didn't do what

81
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Happened how did it go

82
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,503
Nothing could have prepared me for how disappointed

83
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
There was a piano and that was the

84
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,695
The closest

85
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Play piano.

86
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
20K

87
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
A drum set

88
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Two drumsticks

89
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
There were set up and if the

90
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
I can't press the drumsticks

91
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Then there was a guitar

92
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,687
One of its paws

93
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
So bad

94
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Did any

95
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
Music

96
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Occur there was no choices

97
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,207
There were noises

98
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Gamblers were

99
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:35,519
Grounding like spraying

100
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,079
What is automatically play Trumpets

101
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Unbelievably bad

102
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
I resented it I am

103
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,831
Murdering myself for not having like 10 million cat puns centered around Charlie Parker and Miles Davis

104
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
It's a bird it's got to happen Birdman I can't think of any

105
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
Calico Parker

106
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
On Wednesday morning

107
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
4

108
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
To the airport

109
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
That my mom's friend also was there

110
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Procaps

111
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
Thought it was funny

112
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Nose opening night in Austin

113
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
It really blew my mind

114
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
So surprised by how disappointed I could be

115
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
That was really what I felt like

116
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
I went in with real low expectations you have a great imagination of what Cody bad and

117
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
And I was still

118
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Not even an even in my

119
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
Head right now knowing what it is

120
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
I still kind of imagine that a cat was capable of holding a couple of drumsticks

121
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Getting some cake battle action going

122
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
I can see it in my mind

123
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
Do you know why cuz you're thinking of like Bill the cat

124
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
The Revenant

125
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,807
More than I could ever have imagined about Idaho

126
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
And I don't know anything

127
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,207
We are going to be in the present-day you know it's a little bit

128
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231

00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823

So

145
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
I don't know if I should lay out my premise ahead of time or let it

146
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:55,199
I'm not sure so I'm just going to get it

147
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,551
Okay I'm going to play another complex drop

148
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
Cat learning how to play the drums for the

149
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
I'm going to be

150
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Neil Peart

151
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
And there you go without the pain

152
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,287
Bezos world.

153
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,127
It is at the richest man in the world

154
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Nottingham

155
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Oh really

156
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:39,231
So let's start on the 5th and I will let us develop as it goes

157
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,607
Alex Jones

158
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Heal from that terrible heart attack he had already

159
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
Interesting solution

160
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
To David nights they're being overworked

161
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
And I having a heart attack

162
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Stop it Ryan

163
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Expanding on that

164
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,719
You just really need to take care of yourself cuz I know good and damn well

165
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
The three-hour show you prepare for

166
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,351
24-hours here in a couple hours at night

167
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
A double

168
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Frankcrum

169
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,455
You just

170
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
I feel like this is a cop-out and they're not

171
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
Serious about what they're doing

172
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Maledon

173
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
But

174
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
You should be really close to the edge good place to be already kind of

175
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,799
Mailing it in for work

176
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
What's Ranch

177
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
Demographic information about

178
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Call

179
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Diagram is old and white

180
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
About David nights listenership

181
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,519
But in actuality

182
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
He's insulting Islam

183
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,647
Z high-end

184
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
Listenership

185
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
I'll be a lot of stress

186
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,839
I can't if I can't believe how bad is Austin as it happens I still can't believe how many production

187
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
We have honor

188
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,983
One of the reasons but it is happening on with a lot of

189
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:35,359
Whether it be the other lawsuits

190
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
The him getting kicked off

191

Sugar daddy

00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,615
He has his waning feelings about Trump that he has to

00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
He needs David

203
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
He needs us.

204
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Lake Apopka

205
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,887
What are you telling David to play a video or do red meat political stuff

206
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
This is his version of that this is Alex's like

Everyone's thrilled to see if you guys can

208
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
Just have a jovial conversation

209
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
Because what

210
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
On top of all of that other stuff

211
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Did Alex's wrestling

212
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
There's something else that's going on in his life

213
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Yeah you bet

214
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
But before you get to that

215
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Yes but it doesn't these announcers

216
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
Talk over his

217
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Like musical interludes

218
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,239
Sometimes you know they like eat fights against corruption

219
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,799
And one of them made a big announcement that I didn't know

220
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
Coming to you live from the infowars.com studios in the recap

221
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,319
Alex Jones

222
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
At some point

223
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
It's no longer

224
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,399
It might have been

225
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Status quo remaining or more democratic

226
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Position

227
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,687
Down the ballot

228
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
I guess the last year it's no longer occupied

229
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
It is recaptcha

230
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
I would like to know

231
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
First

232
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
What their definition of captured

233
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
What the first capture of tech

234
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Does it matter if the Spanish

235
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,679
I tried to find

236
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
I turned Antonio so I couldn't make it to that

237
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
I did go to the spouse

238
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,943
And I found

239
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
Those that were lost at the Alamo the big tribute to Colonel Travis

240
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Man

241
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
There's some crazy races statue

242
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
It is

243
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Not

244
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
There is like an entire 12

245
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
To the Confederate dead

246
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
It is right in front of the State House

247
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
It is talking like it's war of Northern aggression stuff

248
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
And then there's another statue over

249
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Memorializing like Jefferson Davis

250
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Hey man

251
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
You got to give it up to him

252
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
Directions to America

253
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
There's a big logo on my mom

254
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
Not that stuff is there

255
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
It's why I missed out on

256
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
So

257
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
It's been recaptured Texas is cool now

258
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
So

259
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,751
I'm through talking about on this episode

260
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,359
There's more to this than even clips that I have

261
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
And we can discuss that as it goes along but

262
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
VIP

263
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,551
If I were to pull all the clips that would be relevant to this episode it would be 80

264
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
2 day long.

265
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Here is Alex

266
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Introducing

267
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
You can run run run

268
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Getaway

269
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Joe Rogan

270
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
Is a Christmas

271
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
His blood will fill buckets politically

272
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,295
So Stewart Joe Rogan

273
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,903
He's going to politically slit his throat and have his blood filled bucket

274
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Alright

275
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
So I was really hoping he'd gone to the second night of Passover

276
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
What's the Cavs

277
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
He have angry at Joe Rogan day I know it's kind of disappointing

278
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,639
Theory about what's going on

279
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
There's an irony that we're going to be doing an episode hear about how everyone should ignore this

280
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:09,439
Why tyranny to that but I think it's important you just end record

281
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
We're going to have fun on our episode

282
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
People like a Joe Rogan

283
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:22,751
Howard Stern

284
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
To the top

285
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,687
Not I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.

286
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Help

287
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
Beat by pump it up like it's a paper

288
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Review fight because the only person benefits from that is Alex

289
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
And that's why

290
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
He's doing

291
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
A little bit about Alex and Joe Rogan

292
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
And how they got to this

293
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Now we know they've been friends since like 1998 or so they met back in in Austin

294
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,703
Beach other we're crazy

295
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
And just like whatever

296
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
2009

297
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,663
Joe Rogan was featured in the interview for that

298
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
He's been a guest on Alex's show for

299
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Super long time

300
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Circuit Drinking Buddies yeah they like to drink

301
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,671
About 20 years ago

302
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
Joe Rogan had Alex on

303
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Episode 911

304
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
This podcast

305
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
Episode

306
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
And Alex got too drunk and acted like a complete

307
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Their relations

308
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
It was going well

309
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
But since then

310
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
Gaston Rogan's podcast

311
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
Between the two of them behind the music episode right now

312
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,719
Not really cuz I don't understand everything but I can tell you some of the broad Strokes of how this went fat

313
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
Through all of that weird

314
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
From about 2 years ago he was on his show till

315
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Rogan has consistently taken the high road bending over backwards to give Alex

316
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
The very generous public defender

317
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Even four things that Alex

318
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
Didn't deserve

319
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Send at 4

320
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
Over the years Rogan is thrown in little critique of Alex's bulshit but it's

321
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,879
Take a presentation of criticism that never really rises above good-natured ribbing

322
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
Really fine with it

323
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,168
Where things started to heat up was on episode 1131 of Rogan podcast

324
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Dave Rubin

325
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Is released in June 28th

326
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
I'm at episode relationship

327
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
He discusses how much he likes Alex but how wrong he is about a lot of things

328
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
This conversation was started by discussing Alex

329
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,040
The claims that Anthony Bourdain was killed by Hillary people

330
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
And have a sense of that sort of thing

331
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:50,720
Rogan talks about how Alex is also right about a lot of the stuff about particular leaf

332
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:57,120
Earlier time stuff that was actually true

333
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
The thing that he always brings up his

334
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Is the idea of like

335
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:07,872
Police infiltrating peaceful protest in order to turn the violent

336
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
63

337
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,248
So we talked about that a lot of credibility even within this art

338
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,296
Discussion of how he's working about a lot of things

339
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
But you

340
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
Number of the things that he claimed

341
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Are real

342
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,280
And one of those things is the idea that George Soros is a Nazi

343
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
Big piece of business

344
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
Alex

345
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
Call out

346
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,384
Normal stick claim that Soros thinks he's the Messiah and the best time of his life

347
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Alex insist

348
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
But Joe knows all this stuff is true

349
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Because Alex knows the key

350
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
He's told Joe the

351
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,368
You think Joe is injo is just

352
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,720
Defending George Soros even though he knows that he was a Nazi collaborator cuz out

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,048
Alex seems to think it's unfathomable

354
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
The Joe just doesn't believe him

355
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,168
Or that he might have looked into it and found out that Alex isn't making s*** up

356
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
So

357
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Then

358
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
From July 2018

359
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
Predicting the second American Civil War with breakout on Independence

360
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,272
On that Fourth of July recorded episode 1140 of his podcast with Joey Diaz

361
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,136
In the episode he laments that Alex has been saying that he's working with the Deep state

362
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
Soros apologist

363
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
Just because he doesn't agree with Alex about the Nazis

364
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,096
Rogan keeps talking about how much she loves Alex and wishing that he would just calm down

365
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,192
On the second episode Joey Diaz is clearly joking

366
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,496
About being in the CIA

367
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,360
And talking about how he played pranks on Eddie Bravo

368
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
Find middle ground

369
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Also

370
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,088
Lely High out of his mind eating

371
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
That sounds like Joe but from there after this point when Joe talks about it again on the air

372
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,608
For both of their versions of the story they were in communication private

373
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,216
My gut tells me that Joe is able to talk outside edge

374
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
Yeah but I don't know who knows what was actually happening

375
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:18,944
And I was like yeah you know 2019

376
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Outside

377
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
He was introducing Owen Benjamin Leon funny comedian turn fourth our host of Infowars

378
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
A sigma

379
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
I decided it was time for him to attack

380
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,864
He's getting fed up with a Joe I kept enough George Soros talking points

381
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,752
Without ever specifying what those talking points are without ever demonstrating these alleged

382
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Has claimed

383
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,152
You just launched into a screed of vaguely accusing Rogan of being a puppet of the CIA

384
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,248
Working as a modern-day Timothy Leary

385
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
DMT

386
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Mets.

387
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,904
For a perfect libertarian whatever

388
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
Illegal

389
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
But I think they should be illegal

390
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Infowars

391
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,448
Another important thing to consider is that hates Joe Rogan

392
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
I want Benjamin was what you might call an early associate a lot of a lot of the members of the intellectual dark web

393
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:23,456
But no one really cared when he got kicked off Twitter for harassing David Hogg

394
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Parkland shooting

395
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
His

396
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
I want the dump f*** article that came out about the the IDW the internet anyway

397
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
Kind of lost

398
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:43,680
He started making videos about how members of the IDW told him that you hate being kicked off Twitter after

399
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,240
Good for their brain

400
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
We started doing all this stuff at

401
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,872
Kingdom very publicly Joe Rogan is like that

402
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:58,528
He considers the ringleader in the glue of all these years

403
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,904
On calling these people out

404
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
Because he had an intense need to be the victim of the situation

405
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
David foist him into

406
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Infowars personality candidate

407
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
Anyting

408
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,496
But I definitely find it at

409
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
Interesting to Alex's big turn-on Rogan has happened

410
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,920
Fairly soon after he begins work

411
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Stupid coincidence

412
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:32,576
Or it could be this dude being really negative influence on Alex had pushed him over the ledge on his

413
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Erstwhile friend

414
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
I don't know I'm not sure

415
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
But that

416
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
It sounded like any other time but Alex is talk s***

417
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
It was a little bit more like this

418
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Weird little bit

419
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,520
The normal but not much more

420
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,616
Yoshi pretends to know something circles for a bunch

421
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Never demonstrates

422
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
Feels like a big who gives us

423
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:04,064
An episode 1238

424
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Redban

425
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
From February 4th this year

426
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,440
Joe discussed at Alex's in a bad

427
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,768
Play Emily still cares about it but that Alex's lights

428
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,376
He talked about how Alex was lying to him about what he said in the past about Sandy Hook

429
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,168
All the videos

430
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,056
Love Alex saying that it was fake

431
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:30,688
Was that we just had debate

432
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,480
And I can't I can't abide by that

433
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,856
You talked about how he how Alex believed dumb b******* about Rogan being threatened

434
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
And not talking about conspiracies

435
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,464
I have that was all a prank that they played on Eddie Bravo

436
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,840
Joey Diaz told Bravo all this stuff was like

437
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
Pull-A-Part

438
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:55,776
Reporting information

439
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,688
Frank you got that

440
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
But through it all

441
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,576
Joe was still talking about how about

442
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,208
Approaching situation from a position of being a friend

443
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
It was basically you could stop it up by saying like

444
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,816
You need to stop making things up

445
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
But I still love you

446
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Can I be on your show if I saw you I'd give you a hug

447
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:27,520
Yeah that sort of thing complicated complicated

448
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:32,640
Because he knows that everybody looks at Alex's like this guy the f****** monster is a liar and all this s***

449
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
I've known him for a really long time

450
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
He is making stuff up

451
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,880
Physician

452
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,464
All the trouble that Alex

453
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
It wouldn't

454
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
Be there if you didn't

455
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,912
Little bit like saying

456
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
You know what

457
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
You would be

458
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
You wouldn't be

459
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,432
I've always look I love your good dude

460
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
I thought you shouldn't have murdered that guy though

461
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
You can't live your life constantly going

462
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,392
Through it being like everything negative about me is fake

463
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah you can't

464
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Tapping into

465
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Being a little bit

466
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
I want to say I'm not

467
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
F****** the fan

468
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,984
Gullible

469
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
But he does have moments of decency to moments of like

470
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
Not knocked out falling

471
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Into traps grade on news radio

472
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,968
Wonderful

473
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
The 4th they episode with Brian Redban

474
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
It's the next day

475
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Alex

476
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Hear about that

477
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
He is pissed

478
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Because

479
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
Well quite frankly I have a number Theory

480
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,240
Against

481
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,128
IDW dark web

482
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,688
He has Alex

483
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,504
It'd be very easy to be like hey here's a good thing to do

484
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,576
If I were to write this

485
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672
I would Beyond notes I hate Alec

486
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Textbook

487
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
You aren't allowed on social media

488
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
You aren't allowed on all of the platform

489
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
But you know who is

490
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Joe Rogan

491
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Start a fight with him

492
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:36,800
Start a fight with him it'll get so much publicity because then people are going to share all of your stuff

493
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
All over

494
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,016
Actual fight

495
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
You could also appeal to Alex

496
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,344
Ego by being like you could

497
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
Like not in a physical fight now absolute

498
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
On your on your wall or whatever

499
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
You know still like

500
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
I think

501
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
I get the sense

502
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
This is

503
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
Like the motivation

504
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,848
Alex probably feels dumb personal betrayal because

505
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
It's really hard

506
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
To hear

507
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Someone be like

508
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
I care about you baby

509
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
I know for a fact

510
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
You've been lying to me

511
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
Because the only response is that really is like

512
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
I have I have been lying to you I'm sorry

513
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Let's make it right or

514
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
F*** you your clothes

515
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:34,656
How extensive choose the ladder pad

516
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
No

517
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
No and I'm so

518
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,336
I think that this is what's going on and what are the further things that

519
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Believe that

520
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
What I understand

521
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
This B

522
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Howard Stern has been having a Alex

523
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
Impersonator come on his show

524
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
And they make fun of him

525
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
I am so Alex

526
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Started trying attack Howard Stern

527
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,352
And I think it's the same strategy I think it's the same thing but it's got a huge

528
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,424
I attack him to that will give me access to his audience

529
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
Maybe if I do it

530
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
I can't get new people in otherwise

531
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Here's the important

532
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
I know I'm giving

533
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Almost like this

534
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
And the episode already

535
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
But

536
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,112
Alex's business model relies on there being more inflows and outflows

537
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
But he knows that there's going to be

538
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Bebo

539
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
You know that there's going to be people that he can seduce into his worldview

540
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
It is overly simplistic

541
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Crypto bigoted worldview

542
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Because of

543
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,704
The Allure of the mystery of it messed with the forbidden knowledge

544
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,776
Do you know that he can always get people in the door

545
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
If people

546
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Have access to his bank

547
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
He also knows

548
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,920
That not everyone staying around

549
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,016
People are going to get disenchanted they're going to start looking into things buddy

550
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
At least some portion of them are

551
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,648
So he needs there to be more inflow than out

552
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,696
Flow and everything was fine

553
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
From a business model perspective

554
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,536
When he was allowed on every

555
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
And now he's not

556
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
That's why his numbers are are down is because

557
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,496
The rate of people leaving him has stayed consistent

558
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,312
Writing the rate of people coming in has gone down

559
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,592
Solution today

560
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Find more ways

561
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
To get people in

562
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
You could do almost

563
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
No better

564
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Then Co-op

565
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Joe Rogan and Howard Stern

566
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
Especially if you do it simultaneously

567
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,696
So I think that's the strategy that's going on sorry about the little bit of their butt

568
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Pathetic

569
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,840
And very sad situation only thing that makes sense for him to do I mean

570
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,912
Is if I was writing a business plan it's like

571
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
Okay so I attack

572
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,264
Joe Rogan and Howard Stern

573
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
And I turn a s*** ton of people often

574
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
But

575
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,688
Blisters that they have

576
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,320
Just looked into it and it's like this Alex Jones

577
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,672
A billion people

578
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
Desperate

579
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Realizes

580
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
We can't get access to

581
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Any other way

582
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Big part of it

583
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
The reason I want to focus on the Rogan one more than Howard Stern one is

584
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,104
I'm not a big Stern guy and I think there's a lot of difficulties with him

585
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
But I don't want to unpack

586
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
Rogan is more familiar to our show

587
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Personal

588
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Stop there

589
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,160
Like Alex and Rogan have much more of a personal relationship

590
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
I've watched the videos of Rogan talking about him

591
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,280
They come from a place of humanity

592
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
They come from a place of him being a friend

593
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
But he's talking to a guy doesn't want

594
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,216
Terrible things about

595
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
And then took to hear what Alex ends up saying about Rogan

596
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
It makes it

597
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Awful like it's a really heart-wrenching kind of

598
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
Like I just played

599
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
Alex

600
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Right that's part of being a psychopath

601
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Right

602
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,864
You know you got one guy saying hey I like this guy a lot either friend

603
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
You know it

604
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
When were together I use my friend

605
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,288
Right about certain things I wish you would stop doing that

606
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,824
And then your response

607
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
I'm going to hang him up by the legs and

608
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Political

609
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
It's the pits

610
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,272
It's not it's not a good reaction

611
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,184
Is very similar reaction to What American Psycho

612
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
It makes the most sense as is

613
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,888
Alex speech

614
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
We're marching to Valhalla

615
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:58,080
What kind of mood he's in after he talked about slitting Rogan's throat

616
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,992
Already told you bubbalus volume Enya's of the system a long time ago

617
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:11,392
God I feel scared

618
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,768
Why are my soul right my heart

619
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
Journey

620
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
I'm on the path of my ancestors

621
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:36,224
Why do they not do it it's a loser so

622
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,576
People chosen your lot with the Devil

623
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Take you on

624
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,256
It'll be this contest that defines us

625
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
I guess you we are

626
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,800
I start taking the devil on it today we start 11

627
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
Menu shivaay Rising

628
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
You realize God's in control

629
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
Blush got2b

630
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
Enemies got to be engaged

631
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136

Sword got2b shield

633
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
Got to come down that's cool

634

We'll see heaven

635
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Roof okay

636
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Alright cool

637
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
You never like to see guy in this kind of state

638
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,184
That song is a lot better with Alex Jones

639
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,000
Anytime soon

640
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,656
Yeah I just talked to more about I was going to politically split Rogan

641
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,384
Squealing it's up by flag it's better to get the blood out

642
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,624
To that Joe Rogan fix the show

643
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
Cuz your rabbit is a freaking hog

644
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Ouch

645
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,048
Ouch I need to drive home

646
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
If you listen to the stuff on Rogan show

647
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
It's not scabies

648
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472
It's very soft

649
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
It is a friend

650
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,336
Struggling with his emotionally resonant

651
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Yeah

652
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,016
I like this guy if we're together we're friends I would give him a hug

653
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,064
Alex responds to that

654
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
In the most in

655
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,208
Human way you just makes fun of the idea that Rogan trying to treat him like a person

656
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,256
Oh I love Joe yesterday

657
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Alex

658
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,608
I still want to be your friend

659
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
My friend

660
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
I am so scared right now you're so

661
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Popular bald head

662
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
Muscles and take all that growth hormone a steroid

663
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
Help me I'm weak

664
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
I'm sorry

665
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,536
Wow

666
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
Threatening

667
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
Which is strange

668
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Well the threat is

669
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Like

670
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
Alex has to admit that he

671
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
Capable of having emotions

672
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,872
Because in this situation that

673
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,944
For him would come off as a threat because

674
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,528
Joe is presenting himself as the

675
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Person taking the high road

676
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
The person who cares

677
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
Is the person who

678
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:02,560
In Alex's for at a higher level

679
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
It is it is paternal

680
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,424
Joe saying all this stuff is like

681
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Utah

682
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,520
You could say it's you talking to your friend who's lost

683
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
But if you're Alex you could hear it as

684
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,712
Prodigal son lost his way

685
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
F*** you

686
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
You're a piece of s***

687
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
You don't like that kind of

688
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
There are some parts of

689
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Other,

690
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,536
What do you hear Alex talking about some of this stuff is like

691
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,376
People drinking adrenochrome and stuff like that

692
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,144
The guy I knew

693
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,496
He's going through some s***

694
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
Looks like it's yeah

695
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
I could see the

696
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Like

697
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,128
Alex could be threatened

698
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
By the idea of it

699
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
He's in tire

700
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Sort of

701
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,016
Primary brand right now isn't

702
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,088
Someone who actually knows him is pointing out like

703
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Do you have

704
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:02,464
Shifted entirely

705
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
No

706
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
And I guess

707
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
Could respond to that

708
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
Absolutely

709
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
Alex makes

710
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Text Joe

711
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
I've no idea

712
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,856
Oh oh

713
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,488
Maybe get those Italian Guys in the end in Vegas do something for you job so scared them to

714
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
He is making implications

715
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:45,472
Money does throughout that like the people behind the ustr

716
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,568
Rogan has mob ties

717
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
In Vegas

718
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:58,783
Impossible it's not beyond the available possibility yeah but you're actually makes a lot of sense

719
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,879
I would buy that others like Direct

720
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,463
Are based on

721
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
From Twitter

722
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,279
Was on Rogan show

723
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
Alex

724
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Was banned from Twitter

725
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Endorsi said I don't know

726
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:22,335
Offended by that no but I honestly I think

727
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,175
The idea that he wasn't directly involved in that

728
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,223
Oh yeah I would believe that is a possibility

729
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:34,879
I think it's also possible where he's like I'm of course I don't know why he's banned I'm letting somebody

730
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,951
Twitter right now

731
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Look

732
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:44,351
All the like if you if he legitimately asked Jack he's like okay

733
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,167
What were the reasons that Alex was bad

734
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
And Jack responded with the actual reason

735
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
Right next thing that you said like for the smartest thing to say is I don't know

736
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Okay

737
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
Trump did that

738
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Stop that.

739
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Trump said that

740
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
Prompted that trumpet.

741
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
What are your reasons

742
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,903
You do enter a conversation

743
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,975
The correct

744
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
Possibly Acura company doesn't know

745
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Operational

746
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,567
I believe that 100% Groupon Eric lefkofsky didn't know s*** about what was going on

747
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
In any

748
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,895
I like assertive tendril of the company

749
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,735
See you weren't there on the day he was filming the episode for Undercover Boss

750
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
I mean I met him a couple times

751
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
But

752
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,183
Casual

753
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
I was going over the billionaires list

754
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
Yeah I can't

755
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,239
Billionaire son-of-a-b****

756
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,871
My feeling on this

757
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
Alex

758
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:01,919
Understandable

759
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,735
But also on that

760
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
Alex claims Rogan disclose

761
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,159
That Dorsey is financially involved with one of his sponsors

762
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,951
Which is Cash app

763
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Rogan says

764
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Disclose that

765
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,863
I don't know I think

766
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
I knows it from other Clips I've seen of Rogan talking about

767
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,847
And a reasonable person would assume

768
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
That's like from their conversation

769
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
That

770
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Dorothy

771
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Twitter is

772
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Like in financially involved with it

773
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,831
It says

774
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
As a lot of the stuff Alex's.

775
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:57,471
Albertsons primary business model for years was having my guests as

776
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
Bob Chapman's entire existence of the show was basically predicated on that criticism

777
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Joe might have liver extinct

778
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
Joe might have

779
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
Splinter in his eye but Alex's

780
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:16,671
Whatever

781
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:20,767
Find the proof of the Splinter is in the pike

782
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,631
So the other criticism that Alex has is that Joe's involved in pump and dump schemes

783
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
Okay

784
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,471
Maybe

785
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,055
I love it when two people that I don't like

786
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,359
I'm a reveal information where I'm like

787
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Sure

788
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Go for it

789
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,967
I know he's a s*** I agree on all fronts

790
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,527
I know with a reasonable amount of

791
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,695
Very good reason to believe that a number of Joe's gas over the years especially

792
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Really heavily

793
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:55,327
Probably involved in some pump and dump

794
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:08,127
I don't know if Joe was involved I don't know if he got any money out of it

795
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
Involved in elevating some of these people

796
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,319
Whether it was intentional or not

797
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
That criticism is fine

798
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,415
But I also still don't think it married

799
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
I really don't like

800
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
I think there is a different way to do this

801
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
I think that Alex

802
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,887
Is really just trying to lure Rogan into a protracted

803
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
Where'd you can get

804
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
This is professional wrestler

805
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
For sure

806
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
This is a job man

807
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
Before he gets to Rogan he keeps saying I'm going to get to him

808
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,503
Forgets the other guy

809
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
I guess that it's that big stink

810
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Letter

811
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,903
Videos around and stuff like that

812
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,095
Penis

813
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,447
Alex is saying that this dude is saying that Alex

814
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Is threatening to kill the families

815
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
Stuff like that

816
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,663
Is about like what do you do with obviously

817
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
We bad

818
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
Like what

819
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
The sort of people who threaten the families

820
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
A victim

821
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,767
He's not saying that Alex is one of them

822
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Like

823
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,935
Intentionally misrepresents whatever this

824
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,495
Something bad

825
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:43,103
People's families right or another like tendril of another correction of this

826
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
Whatever

827
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Is this guy

828
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Didn't do it now

829
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Madelaine petsch

830
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,007
Evil in themselves

831
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,639
Viv

832
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,735
I don't think

833
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
If I was casting

834
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,415
Joseph

835
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:32,511
More like Nazi sign

836
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
Okay alright

837
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:38,143
Pathetic

838
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Great Clips

839
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
Only vaguely mentioned Alex

840
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
Peoples

841
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
And second

842
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:57,343
The first thing that I thought was this guy

843
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:04,255
He was not a very compelling

844
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
So

845
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Eclipse

846
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Garbage

847
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
The reasoning that I was

848
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
Just enjoy how like Slims

849
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,623
You trying to come down on

850
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
For possibly having

851
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Group that

852
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,815
Sponsors hamavet does DMT retreat

853
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Or something like that

854
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
What I would call

855
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
Prude

856
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
That the government

857
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
Vault okay

858
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,127
Then we looked at the group's funding Joe Rogan

859
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
Single-handedly

860
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
We watch the hold

861
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Ayahuasca

862
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
Movement with retreats

863
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,743
And the police universities are involved

864
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Which shows you the seven funny

865
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
I want to know

866
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,887
How many cities

867
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,471
I want to listen cannot be long

868
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
But he's saying that universities are involved

869
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Improve

870
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
Substantiate that University

871
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
Government

872
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
If funding is involved

873
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
0 private owner 20 private university

874
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Because

875
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
I did find

876
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
Ayahuasca

877
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:42,047
Group in in Chicago

878
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,631
Do universities

879
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,191
I went I couldn't actually partaking

880
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
Because I

881
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
Pillow

882
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,991
Tiamat Danny's there's one thing everyone knows

883
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
I kind of

884
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:14,047
Faulty assumption that there would be like sleeping bags

885
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
Hell no they

886
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Whatever

887
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,711
They're very secretive number one

888
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:38,111
I don't think her Goodreads

889
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,255
That's not true there is some places

890
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
You can go

891
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
Letter like a Native American

892
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Places you can

893
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
Contain

894
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
As part of religious ceremonies

895
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Here are the United States

896
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,383
Number in like South America and Central America

897
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
One of Alex's former guests

898
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,735
Who we just tried to brainstorm

899
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,831
I can't remember what his name

900
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
Hibachi

901
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
Jesus started his own cottage industry

902
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
Retreats in

903
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Central America

904
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:21,631
He didn't have a problem with that guy why does he have a problem now

905
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,007
What are all these criticisms that he's has like there's like

906
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
A couple of them that I find

907
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Samaritan

908
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,871
But also

909
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
Your reason for bringing this up stock

910
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
And the rest of them

911
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:42,111
Your own stated ideology

912
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:53,631
What don't you want to maximize freedom

913
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
Counter

914
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Libertarianism

915
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
Anyway

916
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,687
Alex Logan has government

917
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
EPA

918
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Absurd idea

919
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:14,367
And then he expresses his idea that Rogan participates

920
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
But you talked about here.

921
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
Call Joe.

922
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,519
Skip it all headed back on it but I said no just translation please please please let me back on

923
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
Shootings happen

924
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,383
Stage before

925
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
So people right question

926
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,735
Stop going the talking point I said it's really scary

927
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039
How you follow every talking point

928
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
Betty gets even worse

929
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,511
He calls me before the election

930
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
Having some pacifism be alright was getting banned

931
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,655
Researching

932
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,431
Floyd Mayweather

933
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,319
Product.

934
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
There

935
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
Alex's

936
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
Complain to someone

937
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,839
Integrity in video games

938
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,775
It is a valid criticism just not coming from Allen exactly I don't know that it's true

939
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Don't care I can't

940
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
Stress enough how much I don't care

941
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,431
What these 280 little

942
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:47,807
Yeah it's only because it is criticism that we've made of Alex

943
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
Joe Rogan's doing this like

944
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:54,975
Shady business. I don't know that he's doing it.

945
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
We know that Alex

946
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,351
Orlistat

947
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Alex's in this place

948
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Complaints about Joe

949
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,359
In the same way he did when he was saying that like

950
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,015
He doesn't think that Soros is a Nazi but knows he is because

951
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,087
Obviously

952
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:26,463
Or they're or they're corrupt

953
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Possibly decent criticisms

954
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Week 1

955
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
I think he wants this all out

956
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Conflagration

957
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
Between the two the

958
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,127
It benefits him

959
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
Is it out here

960
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
And then

961
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,039
It's just something like this till 1

962
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Years ago

963
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
I should have ignored that

964
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,583
Are Charming.

965
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,119
I want more Joe

966
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,191
I want floor I don't want to be nice

967
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Comprende

968
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,591
I hear so much pain throughout this entire

969
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:19,199
Fight bang Newsradio reference accidentally

970
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,063
Don't you remember super karate monkey

971
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,671
Weight of War

972
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
It's fight for me

973
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,607
How else would it be

974
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,191
At some point

975
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:46,335
And then the super karate monkey death car will come from my heart

976
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
He wants war in the reasons

977
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Estate

978
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,479
Things are in right now is good for

979
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
For him

980
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,295
If anything all this is going

981
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
To do is make

982
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
If you like thinking that Alex

983
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
Because if

984
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,047
Rogan's audience

985
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327
That might

986
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,983
Tickled

987
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:20,127
Maybe he's somebody to look into he's an equal right and instead is looks like he's

988
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,967
He's pathetic going to lose he's trying to do essentially what

989
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,783
To workout with

990
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
Glenn Beck

991
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,599
Right back in 2009

992
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
One-sided

993
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
You rude

994
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
That worked out for Alex

995
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
Think about

996
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,119
This

997
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,239
I don't know how to put it any simpler

998
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
Another one

999
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Yeah it's just

1000
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,359
Start picking fights

1001
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
With people in order to gain access to Their audience

1002
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
Claim you're bigger than them

1003
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
Because I have all the audience members

1004
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,999
It's just a principal thing

1005
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,631
You know it's just a steam I'm offended by that what you going to do

1006
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,191
The only thing I'm going to give Alex credit for

1007
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Is

1008
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,543
There were so many times you could have got on board with some

1009
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Bitcoin scheme

1010
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
Never

1011
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:29,759
Again I might Furious that that is because he does not understand it because it's not physical

1012
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,831
Very possible and fact that he's run buy gold

1013
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
Cool I want some Bitcoin

1014
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
You don't get ahold of

1015
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
I don't understand is blockchain

1016
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:53,055
What's going on

1017
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
Our laurels

1018
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,807
Yeah I do respect that on some level

1019
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
Because he had a bunch of these

1020
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
Please Bitcoin

1021
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
On his show over

1022
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,279
People coming in and telling

1023
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,399
He could but I agree

1024
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Even if it is

1025
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
Good all them for me that's true

1026
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:35,807
Whatever leave it even if it's a neutral it's a neutral positive or whatever

1027
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Alex

1028
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
Just got this

1029
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927
Has discovered about Rogan

1030
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,207
And his position in

1031
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
In the world

1032
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Okay

1033
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
4

1034
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Everything

1035
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,431
I'm going to expose

1036
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,783
Because you're there darling I figured it out

1037
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,367
You're there baby cakes were there model the future

1038
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,951
You're on the internet but no one else has some

1039
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
Bleuroot everyone

1040
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,327
Really hope

1041
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,375
I don't think that

1042
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
Joe's anyone's darling except

1043
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:33,663
Right

1044
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:38,015
Craigslist

1045
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,671
Is it like a restrained populist nationalist types

1046
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,023
Survey just data about how how many is bad

1047
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,399
And you're like a lot of them said I don't know those are the people who listen to

1048
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,191
Joe Rizza heavy overlap

1049
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:02,591
You're a little bit earlier but maybe even more to the idea that

1050
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
Rogan is kind of

1051
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
I'm back

1052
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Then

1053
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,247
I gave credence

1054
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,391
Like you was right about some stuff every now and again but also

1055
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,951
The conduit towards harder right

1056
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,255
Through a lot of the the narrative

1057
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
You got engaged in

1058
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
Lot of things

1059
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,375
Underlying his

1060
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911
It is a ideas

1061
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
I think there's

1062
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
Herbicide for that

1063
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:35,615
Diaz's on Fox News

1064
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
Glenn Beck

1065
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
Very strange booking

1066
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
You should all

1067
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,343
I don't think

1068
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,743
I don't think there's a one-to-one parallel what is the same

1069
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
Is it there very

1070
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,119
That don't appear to be what you're getting involved

1071
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
Glenn Beck

1072
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
Was a berry

1073
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Important

1074
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:06,079
Piece of radicalization towards hard tea party stuff

1075
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,871
And people like Alex Jones

1076
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
The same

1077
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
Joe Rogan

1078
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Exist

1079
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,991
Every sort of tepid bath

1080
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
You can get into

1081
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,319
But the water rises really fast

1082
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
You don't realize

1083
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,159
Always having all these islamophobic assholes

1084
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:25,791
Hey man we're just having to

1085
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,119
Great I think there's something

1086
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,655
But also

1087
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
The interesting difference

1088
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,775
Is that

1089
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Back in the day

1090
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,615
Was the sole

1091
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,919
Glenn Beck pipeline

1092
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
Beneficiary

1093
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,599
Because people who would get sort of seduced in with Glenn Beck's at 3

1094
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
When they would watch

1095
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,183
Travel towards

1096
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
Nowadays with Rogan

1097
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
It doesn't necessarily flow to Alex

1098
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,607
It flows to people like Jordan

1099
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:05,215
Peterson vs right

1100
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,263
Sobe idea of him attacking joke

1101
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,567
The pipeline doesn't

1102
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Right

1103
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:15,967
It's interesting I don't know these are a lot of unprocessed thoughts

1104
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
Alex

1105
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,551
Feeling very very jealous that

1106
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
Like the

1107
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,879
View space pictures

1108
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159
Carved out

1109
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:28,255
Almost single-handedly carved out for himself

1110
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,095
The world

1111
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,191
Has now been superseded by all kinds of dumb

1112
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,079
Looks like 9 or Ben Shapiro or

1113
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,407
God dammit I paved the way and I'm getting

1114
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Like I get it

1115
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
Yep

1116
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:53,087
He's he's getting taken down by Marlo man that's what's going on here

1117
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,439
He's a he was a what's-his-face

1118
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
He helped

1119
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
Create

1120
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
As Foster people who are much more

1121
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,303
Slick

1122
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,727
Better at the tools of the last generation

1123
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,287
That

1124
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,311
The nature of life

1125
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,895
That's why you got to do positive things

1126
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,223
Got a nurture positive folk because they will use those

1127
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,039
In positive ways

1128
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:29,951
And we talked so much about it but it's always important

1129
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,999
Make an effort to be a ladder down

1130
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,863
When I if I go up I'm putting the ladder down for you to

1131
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
Give me Bono I think a lot of help

1132
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,335
He's going to destroy Joe Rogan

1133
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:51,711
The French don't matter to me

1134
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,783
That's not a threat to you again I'll never come on your show again

1135
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
I'm going to destroy you

1136
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
Get you

1137
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Coming

1138
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,679
Do you think I am what you think I do

1139
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:18,335
This is like leaving weird voicemails

1140
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:24,735
I'm still your friend

1141
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:28,063
And I care about you

1142
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
I want war

1143
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
Hey that's not a threat

1144
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:38,559
Well that's a threat and you do you know how when you know how was somebody's like I love you

1145
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,959
You and I care for you and your like I will kill you because that's what I heard you m***********

1146
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,519
Those are Fightin words

1147
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,127
I honestly feel like

1148
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,223
Is this a show

1149
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,039
Breakdown

1150
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,879
And I don't know if there's much value other than demonstrating

1151
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,999
What are you doing is trying to find

1152
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767
NuWave

1153
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
To get that inflow of people

1154
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,863
To replace the people who are leaving

1155
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,423
Yeah it is the best way to do it

1156
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
I don't know

1157
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,543
I'm not sure it's a hardest hitting episode will ever have done in our lives

1158
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
But I think it's

1159
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
Important

1160
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
Every now and again

1161
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,151
Make a demonstration

1162
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
She's doing

1163
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
And why sometimes

1164
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
It's very enticing

1165
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
To post a ton of stuff about like

1166
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
That impulse

1167
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,255
Because you're playing into the

1168
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
The troll that Alex is doing

1169
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
You are unwittingly being a part of his

1170
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
PR stunt

1171
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
That would just

1172
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Fall flat

1173
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Right

1174
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,031
That's that's one of my larger thesis about alot

1175
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
I am interested

1176
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Good to know

1177
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Because

1178
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
Because the

1179
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,991
The problem with the performative aspect

1180
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Podcasting

1181
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,367
You know even if you have Joe Rogan

1182
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Audience

1183
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
He's like

1184
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
Of that

1185
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,607
Like I love you and I care for you and I would still give you a hug

1186
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,471
Calculated how much of that is part of the performance conversation

1187
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:27,871
Exactly stand up for a long time

1188
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
Making things

1189
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,199
You plan to say see you next

1190
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,551
So I don't know you could if you want

1191
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,903
He's trolling Alex with

1192
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,999
His decency never like

1193
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,607
Gordian knot

1194
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,703
You cannot untie interested in

1195
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,543
It all makes perfect sense to me

1196
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,943
The f****** lunatic of course he's going to react like this lunatic with

1197
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
Who's clearly stands

1198
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,343
It's a benefit from his opportunity motive

1199
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
Where is with Jo Jo has

1200
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,463
No reason to talk about Alex

1201
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,279
He does in the sense that a lot of people would be

1202
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
Find it weird if

1203
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,775
People expect him to

1204
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,335
At least address the idea

1205
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,919
But my thought is like

1206
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Snow White

1207
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:42,111
JoJo's actual response like just from a perfect emotional human standpoint to this

1208
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:46,463
Because my suspicion is Joe is going to listen to this and be like

1209
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,839
Like I don't know how you could listen to Alex

1210
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,935
Go this far

1211
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
I don't I don't

1212
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
I don't know if he has either

1213
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,287
I'm just saying like

1214
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,687
I don't know if you could listen to this and how over the f****** top it is without being like

1215
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Dude yeah

1216
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,599
If you are not supposed to know the person like a sentence or two words like you know what

1217
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:20,255
I don't was unforgivable and I will never go on a regular show

1218
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,351
Holyshit man that wasn't cool

1219
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:30,495
But if you spend an hour and a half I'm going to light his balls on fire with my nunchucks

1220
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Dude

1221
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
Hey dude I get it

1222
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Fine but

1223
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Reactions

1224
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,503
We generally.

1225
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
And we're not going to do this is definitely not

1226
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:51,231
The ones that are genuine and its next clip

1227
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,399
Don't give me anymore pleasantries

1228
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,215
Give me your stats

1229
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Fabric

1230
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
Now you understand the ship

1231
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,407
Do you understand

1232
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
Down Hillary

1233
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:23,231
Is this what the shape of water was available at Council Rush

1234
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
Because God wants Purity God wants things hot and cold not lukewarm

1235
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Joe Rogan

1236
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,039
Oh that's lame

1237
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
That's lame

1238
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:54,207
Your heart isn't in it then

1239
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
No

1240
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
Wheat

1241
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,191
God blessing

1242
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,775
Mission before I'm done

1243
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,103
At least your destruction

1244
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Michelle was only a baby

1245
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
These fools

1246
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
Must first be destroyed before

1247
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Plant

1248
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,535
Awful

1249
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
It's a kuchen

1250
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,095
It doesn't even feel like

1251
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:38,495
Passionate Alex a million hours of Alex in week until for sure when is Harden in

1252
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:43,871
In the weird song titled Alex Watson

1253
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:50,271
This is a PR stunt

1254
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
The Craft

1255
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,599
Do it there is the idea that

1256
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,951
Give me your attacks that's not saying I want to fight you that's like

1257
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,767
If you attack me I really want that

1258
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,815
Yep be good for me

1259
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,863
Please I'm just a horrible thing

1260
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
In a hole

1261
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
But you cannot

1262
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
Stop yourself

1263
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,959
From responding

1264
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,751
That's what's going on

1265
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
This is a bait

1266
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,055
Troll

1267
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,407
I'm sorry talks about how effective he is at

1268
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,735
Thoughts

1269
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:27,135
Lego

1270
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:32,511
Longs running failure

1271
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Shop

1272
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:45,055
Imma run you politically all the rest your people over so let's go to war

1273
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,639
No one has ever survived Alex attacking them

1274
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:54,527
I'd like to tell you about two people at least one guy probably technically you didn't survive

1275
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:00,671
I don't want guys did I will fight

1276
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,255
This lawsuit or I will die trying

1277
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:08,863
And I'm settled later

1278
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,423
Also Alex had to give a public apology

1279
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,799
YouTube James horrible she said about him

1280
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,103
Like everyone survives Alex's attack

1281
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
Everyone does

1282
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,455
Everyone you know who survives out

1283
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
They just accepted apology

1284
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,039
And don't take him for all he's worth

1285
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,319
Brother defamation

1286
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
Engaged

1287
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,695
So no Alex get out of here with his no one survives my attack

1288
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
The f*** out of here

1289
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,815
You know you know what

1290
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,143
So far with our knowledge of Humvee Lucaya

1291
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,263
He is ever done for the human race is

1292
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,639
To the cleaners

1293
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,199
It's a matter of empathy

1294
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,527
What's a matter of scale

1295
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:01,343
Well you know you know showing Mercy to one person

1296
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
Non-emergency

1297
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
You too many

1298
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
Perhaps

1299
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:10,047
And maybe prioritize the one person who was in the crosshairs over the other

1300
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:19,519
Just I let bygones be morality

1301
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:22,079
And they have in those

1302
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:28,479
If you had a lever would you pull the train to kill one person and save 5 live

1303
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:34,879
Or would you leave it alone

1304
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:39,487
Would you follow through with the lawsuit

1305
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,279
With a penitent bigot

1306
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:46,399
Knowing that their apology will be in fat

1307
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:51,263
Tough decision

1308
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,799
Guest

1309
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,711
Play so I understand greater

1310
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:04,575
Positives could have come out of Alex having to pay millions of dollars or whatever he would have had to pay

1311
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Whatever

1312
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,975
For all the good

1313
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,839
For that

1314
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,935
Alex keeps saying the Joe Rogan uses Soros talkingpoi

1315
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,263
And like I said he never really explains what

1316
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,031
Points are

1317
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055
He does say that

1318
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
He has like

1319
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:32,991
Inside documents of the talking points but he never produces them he never says what they say

1320
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,391
Documents

1321
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
You mean

1322
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,743
By Soros

1323
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
That

1324
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,159
And then they sue me

1325
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,511
Amrit jurisdictions whatever I'm not worried about that

1326
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,071
Shipmates

1327
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,375
Talking points

1328
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
Is Justice reference

1329
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,983
A video that was posted on Media Matters

1330
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,847
Yeah now I do the video probably with added it in as much as

1331
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Tire show

1332
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:37,247
But it's not edited like splice together in such a way as to be like

1333
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:42,367
Rail

1334
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:48,767
It was totally fake

1335
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,423
This is a Soros talk

1336
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Because he got it

1337
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
For Media Matters

1338
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
Is ludic

1339
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
That's just

1340
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,055
Source

1341
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
Vicki found

1342
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,967
Alex said debate

1343
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,575
On Media Matters I found a video that was very clear it's Alex

1344
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
Literally

1345
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
Multiple times

1346
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,231
Multiple instances

1347
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
Kids didn't die there

1348
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,071
That's not using the thoreau's talking point

1349
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
Text using

1350
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
The video that they posted

1351
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,959
Is Anythink

1352
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
Pinpoint

1353
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,127
Pretty much

1354
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
They're not James O'Keefe

1355
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
Right but that is only exhaust

1356
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,303
Joe mentioned that on Media Matters

1357
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,583
I found a video of Alex saying

1358
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Perfect

1359
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,655
It is

1360
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
What he's done is turned

1361
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
Any

1362
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Point of reality

1363
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,383
That he fundamentally disagrees with

1364
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,919
Into a

1365
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,479
Conspiracy or boros

1366
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,183
So so to me it's just him staying surahs talking point is him saying

1367
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,487
A reality that I don't disagree

1368
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,815
Herdy a reality that disagrees with me

1369
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
It is almost it's almost like if you if you were if he'd forgotten where the Mississippi River

1370
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,431
No it's on the line between these states he be like

1371
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,455
Dora's talking

1372
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,759
Doesn't mean

1373
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:48,575
Interest

1374
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,951
That's from infowars.com or

1375
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,023
Daily Caller

1376
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
4

1377
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,119
Daily

1378
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
I don't

1379
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Not WorldStarHipHop

1380
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,727
I do not read it

1381
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:09,311
You know and if the article is good and its source

1382
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,847
I'll still take

1383
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,895
A f****** article from Daily Caller

1384
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
If it's

1385
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
Like if it's a knot

1386
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Information

1387
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:22,367
Rite Aid generally most of the time that I have read them

1388
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,303
But just because I don't like the source doesn't mean I'm going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and State

1389
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:35,423
One might have a good article whatever

1390
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,495
I'm not going to I'm going to come in with a slight prejudice

1391
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,823
But you know allow the possibility that this is real

1392
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,151
Things like I could do that

1393
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:49,759
I could do that like oh Alex has reference article business big Tucker Carlson

1394
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Fun

1395
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
Because it's

1396
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
It's stupid

1397
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,207
Any ideas

1398
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:02,047
OBD2 matters got some funding from George Soros

1399
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,351
Oh it's all Soros narratives

1400
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
The f*** out of here

1401
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:12,799
Sojourn I got a question for you

1402
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:25,088
What kind of literature we do you know about my boys

1403
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,328
The show Alex launches into a course of two clips

1404
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,424
A discussion about Moby Dick Moby Dick

1405
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,824
I want I think it was read the headline of Moby Dick

1406
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,640
Moby Dick

1407
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:55,040
Guy obsessed with rooting for him or wait

1408
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,880
I don't think he knows queequeg

1409
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
I want to say

1410
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
Before we get into any

1411
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
I don't know what

1412
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
I'm not sure but I do know he has not Read Moby Dick

1413
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,656
Pressure

1414
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,984
You've chosen the wrong side and you're going to be

1415
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
Destroyed

1416
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,824
Matter what happens to me Joe you're done

1417
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
And the whale

1418
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,320
Melba's Joe Rogan

1419
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,904
Bill shakes

1420
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
You should

1421
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
I sit there

1422
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
With the number one political show on YouTube

1423
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,936
The gel was viciously jealous

1424
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Admit it was way bigger than the show

1425
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
We talked about how I want is showing all this crap

1426
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:56,480
I don't want morals that I didn't earn I don't want to be you

1427
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,064
I don't think everything

1428
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:09,280
Is Joe and happy

1429
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
Metaphor

1430
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
I guess

1431
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,656
Are there any other supporting characters

1432
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,496
Meditation

1433
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,080
Here's my problem with this I don't even understand why that start

1434
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,408
You know I can't understand why the Moby Dick metaphor started

1435
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:30,784
I think what he's thinking is who's hunting who

1436
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,392
I think what I think he's thinking he's Captain Ahab and Rogan is the white whale

1437
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:41,792
Yes I agree

1438
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,192
I don't get what you just said

1439
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,104
If anybody wins

1440
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,248
Middle of the movie or the guy one

1441
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,808
So you know what

1442
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
None of them were a good guy

1443
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Alex

1444
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:15,072
In that clip I was like I'm very confused by what you're trying to say

1445
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:19,424
I don't understand how the other hand

1446
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,496
It was a metaphor for other ship

1447
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,336
In his next court Alex tries to take the metaphor in two different

1448
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,104
Places

1449
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,920
Oh that's not going to be interesting Lee makes it

1450
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,968
Worst

1451
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:40,416
More clear that he doesn't know what he's talking about

1452
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Well is he

1453
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,960
That's true

1454
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,736
Alright alright

1455
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
That's the only part of my

1456
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,832
Is Alex going to come correct

1457
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Nope

1458
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
If you're a whale you're fighting a big squid

1459
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,744
3 * Benjamin

1460
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
Noel no sperm

1461
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,608
Schlong

1462
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
One of my tentacles

1463
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
Retard

1464
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Okay

1465
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,272
And don't worry I'll show you

1466
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,576
Shlomit

1467
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
Very slowly

1468
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,744
Please give you what you want alleyway

1469
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
Pictures of God

1470
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
Full

1471
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,472
Upload

1472
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
I wish I was a god about how like is that effect

1473
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,320
I'm the squid

1474
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,368
What is my great headed

1475
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,648
Starts within

1476
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:22,048
Interesting like a joke

1477
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
12 year old

1478
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,056
That's very different

1479
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:36,128
Maybe that maybe

1480
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:45,088
Thought it wasn't

1481
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:50,464
I remember my favorite part of Moby Dick was whenever Captain Ahab

1482
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:55,072
Tragically throwing his Spirit at the well and then goes down and

1483
01:25:56,096 --> 01:26:02,240
It turns out that there's just a giant squid that Aiden both he was a real Twilight Zone twist for

1484
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:06,592
Ending

1485
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:13,248
Play disappointing narrative level

1486
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:22,720
Thoughts about

1487
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,280
What Alex's motivation is in

1488
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
Express already

1489
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
I think

1490
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,448
Spr stock

1491
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
Involved in Owen beds

1492
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
Being negative in

1493
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,056
But then

1494
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
Next clip gives

1495
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
A reason

1496
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
Why he's doing this

1497
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
That I think is

1498
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
Simultaneously

1499
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:45,504
True and also Alex

1500
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
Is staying

1501
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,832
A sort of blustery bulge

1502
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,648
Yeah

1503
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Percent truth

1504
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
You're my way to get Jack Dorsey

1505
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
And you're my way to get them all

1506
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,888
And so now

1507
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
It's kinda like

1508
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Mistletoe

1509
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,312
You can hit those buttons as fast as you want

1510
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,872
Just keep coming down

1511
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,760
Body launched 1,000 other missiles

1512
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
St.joe

1513
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
Pretend Hollywood world

1514
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
I'm in the

1515
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
Big boys

1516
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,768
Sorry what was stopped pontificating

1517
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,656
Metaphoric

1518
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,704
Whistlestop is not the 50

1519
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,472
2% true

1520
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,496
I think Thursday

1521
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,056
To Alex thinking attack

1522
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
Joe will somehow

1523
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,872
Be a message

1524
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
To Jack and maybe get a

1525
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,968
On Twitter or something like that

1526
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:53,344
Jack through attacking Rogan something like that

1527
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,928
First of all I feel like affected Alex's

1528
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,720
It's not really what he's

1529
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,328
And then also I just don't think it's a reasonable expectation

1530
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,608
Have from attacking

1531
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
I think

1532
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,520
Now white whale

1533
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:17,664
Call the social media is Alex as well

1534
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,200
He's going to go down

1535
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:20,992
And

1536
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
He's never getting back

1537
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Neither

1538
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
And even if he does

1539
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
It will be at the end of both of the

1540
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,416
Friendster is a squid

1541
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,440
Printer isn't

1542
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,536
Going to be amazing if prinster wound up winning throughout all of us

1543
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,096
Somebody just brings it back how

1544
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,448
That would be a twist

1545
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:46,848
I don't know if M Night Shyamalan directed Moby-Dick social media

1546
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,504
So I even Bravo telling Alex that Rogan was being threatened

1547
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,064
Then all that stuff was a Joey Diaz prank

1548
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
Yeah Alex doesn't realize that

1549
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
And you attacked me

1550
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:06,048
And say I was dishonest with you and then he goes Owen

1551
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,352
I was never threatened Jones what about that

1552
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,400
Eddie Bravo

1553
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
He said that

1554
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
Why

1555
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
It doesn't matter Joe

1556
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:27,552
You shouldn't listen to Eddie Bravo Bravo

1557
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:33,952
Sweetheart but he is the dumbest man I've ever heard speak

1558
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,768
Very smart and specific ways like a don't take that away from

1559
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,608
The infant's brain has a

1560
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
Capacity

1561
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,424
To understand a lot of

1562
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,448
Kinesthetic

1563
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,288
You and I couldn't talk

1564
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
Use your body in certain

1565
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,128
He's a genius

1566
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,944
Very f****** gullible

1567
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,272
He's very

1568
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:03,392
Presently certainly has become in the past

1569
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:05,952
I would tell you the very fun person

1570
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,256
Be around yet

1571
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,536
Ideas

1572
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,816
The can't be backed up

1573
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,376
Alex is not the sort of receptor

1574
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:18,752
But he's a bad person to talk to Eddie Bravo cuz Eddie talks

1575
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
It just repeats

1576
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:23,104
I'll take that as a source

1577
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,200
Yeah yeah

1578
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,248
Joe Rogan

1579
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,320
And then when it comes out baby

1580
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,648
Out Pizza in my family's been threatened

1581
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,416
Bulshit

1582
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,720
I don't know I don't know why you think

1583
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:42,560
Turns out is Joe Diaz

1584
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
EBU

1585
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
Alex Jones

1586
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Or reporting

1587
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,568
The Eddie Bravo tells you socially

1588
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
That calls into question

1589
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,896
Everything that

1590
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,200
You've ever reported from an anonymous source

1591
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
Because it could be

1592
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:07,392
Eddie Bravo level it could be anywhere

1593
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:12,256
No disrespect but you're not a high-level Source interesting about him

1594
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Island

1595
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
Episodes

1596
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,936
Little annoying

1597
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:25,056
I have no problem with that

1598
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:29,920
I wish I could remember gullibility

1599
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,016
Yes he has some interest

1600
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,880
He has a complete lack of

1601
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:45,536
He's a complete lack of God

1602
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Appear to be like

1603
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,168
Yeah wants to believe

1604
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:57,056
It's not that he wants to do anything beyond that it's like Fox Mulder

1605
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
Which could be Fox Mulder

1606
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,200
This

1607
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:08,576
So funny

1608
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:11,648
In the middle of this show or towards the end

1609
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
And Alex

1610
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,232
The break music is playing

1611
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,792
Going

1612
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:23,424
Kool herc

1613
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Nothing

1614
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:31,872
Launch into an entirely conversation as a heartbreak

1615
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,688
Well he talks about darts as a metaphor

1616
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,552
I'd like

1617
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
I'm sorry

1618
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,184
Red Lobster off of all of you

1619
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,488
I've never felt better in my life

1620
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,024
I'm hurting

1621
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,632
It like 15 ft Pro triple bull's-eyes

1622
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,936
Someone helped found a shot at

1623
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:59,520
You may need to

1624
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:07,712
A great darts of The Darkside you might need this herbal to eat

1625
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:11,808
Man there's nothing like a man expressing.

1626
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
Deep psychological pain

1627
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,464
And then getting cut off by

1628
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,536
Yeah of Rogan

1629
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,120
You just interrupted

1630
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,448
And I wanted to cut a bunch of that stuff

1631
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:34,592
For Alex or for understanding

1632
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,408
His mental state like it just was

1633
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
Boilerplate

1634
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,016
He only gets through Maybe

1635
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
Two sentences

1636
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:48,416
Two or three sentences that Rogan says

1637
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:55,072
You know what Paul Joseph Watson hosting the next hour I got to got to let him host

1638
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
So

1639
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
I'm going to get out of here

1640
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,888
You know that's

1641
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,984
The next day I'm in a week

1642
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,520
I know Mike

1643
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,544
Well

1644
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,080
Last night was

1645
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
State of the U

1646
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
So probably going to hear about that

1647
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Nope but also

1648
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:15,808
Call Joe Rogan

1649
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,856
To it so we jump into the 6th

1650
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
And listen to this s***

1651
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,464
You know I miss Joe Rogan phone call last night

1652
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
Had my phone off

1653
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Traded

1654
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,632
I really am so dumb

1655
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:32,704
Disgusted I don't know if I was taking the call and I knew he called

1656
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,968
Joe will be Armitage at the bottom of the next hour

1657
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:54,720
No no no no no

1658
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
No

1659
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,792
No

1660
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
No

1661
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:04,192
Used to believe that the real

1662
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:09,824
It's not wild The Ivy at the very idea

1663
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:15,712
Conciliatory going to slit his throat politically

1664
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,248
Well it's finished

1665
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
So I guess we'll take his call five-year-old

1666
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,624
The factory

1667
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:28,256
I thought you didn't care about going on his podcast

1668
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Seems like you care

1669
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
Bottom of the shower

1670
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,704
Along with traffic

1671
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Course

1672
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,592
What does that mean

1673
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Satire starts with an s

1674
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,432
Does that mean

1675
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,968
Attire clothing

1676
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:50,272
What is satire begins

1677
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,624
I don't I really don't

1678
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,928
I don't get the reference

1679
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:03,584
Might be but I don't I don't

1680
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,352
I heard that

1681
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:10,752
Yeah I don't know but the Joe Rogan is not coming up

1682
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,176
He's going to make fun of Rogan later

1683
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,224
Talk about Rogan

1684
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,016
But you've made it big enough

1685
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,088
If you're listening if you don't like

1686
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,672
That will be something that people start putting out

1687
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,768
Rogan's going to be coming up on the show

1688
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:37,632
That's such a bummer

1689
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
Trick videos

1690
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,728
That's such a bummer I will tell you this right now

1691
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,264
When you type in

1692
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,312
Set the nest

1693
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:49,408
Even if you're using quotation marks around it

1694
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,200
That sounds about right

1695
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:53,760
Are you looking for satire or

1696
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,880
Cooper colloquialisms that don't exist honestly probably a Moby Dick quote

1697
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,160
If I had the gas

1698
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,536
So Alex

1699
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,816
So we all know

1700
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,120
Because I've already told you broken

1701
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,144
I'm coming

1702
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
But

1703
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,800
If you're listening to this you presented

1704
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,896
The premise that Rogan is going to be on later

1705
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
The show

1706
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,200
With a ton of ads

1707
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
And stuff like that

1708
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,808
Because he knows that everybody is sitting there waiting

1709
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,856
He's done what is sort of the

1710
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,928
Propaganda show version of a thirst trap

1711
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,512
Sure there's no cleavage

1712
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,304
Or anything like that but it is

1713
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,352
Anticipation the idea

1714
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:45,728
That Rogan might be calling

1715
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,312
It's like when you're watching The Biggest Little Whorehouse in Texas

1716
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:53,920
Dolly Parton

1717
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,224
Navigate to music

1718
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,064
Is that Alex does talk a bit about the the

1719
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,416
What I would categorize as like blah

1720
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,976
He's defending Trump but it's not

1721
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:07,744
The same as a

1722
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,048
It's not

1723
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
The same thing

1724
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,352
It's different

1725
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,888
Trump five

1726
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,192
Virtue of attacking

1727
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,008
It's different than like

1728
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,056
This guy gets it all

1729
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,848
Now the exception is

1730
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,640
Was talking about killing baby

1731
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
As opposed to

1732
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
You talking about

1733
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,480
Preventive care

1734
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,504
Abortion

1735
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,040
But Women's Healthcare

1736
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,832
Alex is thrilled about that

1737
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
Even

1738
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,648
6 months ago

1739
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,720
Sing like that would have been the

1740
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:39,744
The entire show

1741
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,536
And it was just something you like

1742
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,632
Is it was just another

1743
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Yeah

1744
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,192
There are changes

1745
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,032
But it's not really important because

1746
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
Alex's

1747
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,920
Weird on this February 6th

1748
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,224
Show in a way that I think is irresponsible

1749
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,248
And I think you didn't

1750
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,016
Mean to do

1751
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,296
He starts

1752
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,344
I'm going to be honest with you

1753
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:12,000
He might as well be a Project Camelot episode right now

1754
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:18,656
Slight Rogan stuff and Project Camelot

1755
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,448
Listen to this f****** s***

1756
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
This

1757
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
You might

1758
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:26,848
You could easily imagine Kerry Cassidy listening to this late

1759
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,480
God was real

1760
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,528
Call this was real before

1761
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,088
Right

1762
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:43,488
I went to a city fully under

1763
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,048
Alien control

1764
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,680
Like San Francisco or Seattle

1765
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,032
Breached

1766
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,896
Alien

1767
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:04,992
Whatever's that

1768
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:07,552
That's his one of his producers

1769
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
Seattle

1770
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,376
Answer like Alex going to be like

1771
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,400
He saw that

1772
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,424
Evil there

1773
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:25,216
And I'm guessing what really happened is

1774
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,776
Young Buck some some guy was like

1775
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:30,848
I don't I think that every time we go out at

1776
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,128
It's really hostile

1777
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,944
And I don't want to be I don't want to I didn't sign up

1778
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,504
Ragtime

1779
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,576
The case but

1780
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
Zimmerman

1781
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,488
No he is not yet

1782
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,096
We would round one corner

1783
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:55,680
And The Smiths

1784
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:59,008
Delete

1785
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,056
People were

1786
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:09,248
The corners the next person would finish the sentence

1787
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,088
Play Lottery videos

1788
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:17,952
Do you have do you absolutely have a

1789
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
He hasn't played

1790
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
It would be amazing if he had

1791
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,584
That would be awesome

1792
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:26,912
A conversation with one person over here at the camera pans

1793
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:33,312
Around the corner the other person finishes their sentence of demonic voice

1794
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,640
I would I would have

1795
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:43,040
Perfect video to stay to be very very

1796
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
Yep

1797
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,904
This guy's lazy

1798
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Didn't even read Moby Dick

1799
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,512
I didn't read

1800
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,680
That's one

1801
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:03,520
Alex is under alien

1802
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,288
Control

1803
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:07,872
Demons whatever you want whatever you want

1804
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
I don't think that's good enough

1805
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:14,528
Just missing that he is saying it's demons or aliens

1806
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,320
Because he's saying that

1807
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,368
He makes clear

1808
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
There's no doubt now

1809
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,048
Alien invasion

1810
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,960
They worship

1811
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,008
Believe that they are

1812
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:44,992
We run into these things they're so low-level they're so stupid they're so hateful

1813
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,808
Like zombies is kill people and attack children

1814
01:42:54,720 --> 01:43:00,096
Everybody else

1815
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
Kevin volunteer

1816
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,912
Like astronauts

1817
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,704
Megadoses of broad

1818
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,496
Okay with wires

1819
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,336
Weather

1820
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,944
Keep it coming baby

1821
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,016
I'm eating it out saying

1822
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,552
They're the ones that are doing

1823
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,112
Insane

1824
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
That is

1825
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:26,208
Not be talkin

1826
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
Loose lips

1827
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,512
Snakehips

1828
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:33,632
The quote Ishmael this is

1829
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,912
Terrible

1830
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:39,008
The idea cuz he always talked vaguely about where he's going

1831
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,824
From now we know a lot of that stuff is coming

1832
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,848
Stubblebine

1833
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,296
General stubblebine Alex could not

1834
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,320
Before he was

1835
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,112
70 years old

1836
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
And had been drummed out of the service

1837
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:00,256
In 1984 for bringing psychic

1838
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,816
Sheward areas they weren't allowed to be into

1839
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
And

1840
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:07,168
Years

1841
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:14,848
I don't give a f*** what he's talking about

1842
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
Stood by the quarks

1843
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:19,456
It should not be somebody that you're like

1844
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,992
This guy knows every

1845
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,576
So now Alex

1846
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:29,952
You've got this information about the interdimensional invasion of alien demons and stuff

1847
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,744
And the first thing you come up with it

1848
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,792
Buckets

1849
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
I'm not

1850
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,168
You f***** up by telling me your source

1851
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:39,936
Makes me

1852
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Frustrated

1853
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:44,288
That you can't get a metaphor about Moby Dick

1854
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,336
But at the same time

1855
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:51,456
You're going to say that there are interdimensional aliens and I thought he was starting out as a metaphor

1856
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:58,112
I thought inter-dimensional nope

1857
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,904
Therapy

1858
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:06,304
Wow celebs and the immigrants

1859
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:13,728
I guess it's probably like

1860
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,824
What are you in the hierarchy

1861
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,112
Disco demon

1862
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:36,512
Well we are in Chicago. We were around.

1863
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:42,144
Big fan of a lower level

1864
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,424
Demons

1865
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
Obviously

1866
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,264
The presentation

1867
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
If it is

1868
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
We've left

1869
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
You were a part of

1870
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,992
But probably not

1871
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:00,064
He always tries to do this f******

1872
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:07,232
This what I'm saying

1873
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:12,608
You understand how badly this is life

1874
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:15,168
Slater Hill be like

1875
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
I don't believe it

1876
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,312
If you are

1877
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:24,896
If your enemy believe something you don't believe

1878
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
You don't have to fight them

1879
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:27,968
Because

1880
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
What

1881
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,808
Like if they believe something

1882
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,368
No idea aliens give them power

1883
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,160
And there isn't a power

1884
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
You don't have to

1885
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:41,280
Like just use that power it doesn't exist

1886
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,864
It's not real

1887
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,936
I just want to be really

1888
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:48,960
Clear on this

1889
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,056
People who are like

1890
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
We should

1891
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,640
And can provide Healthcare

1892
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
We should

1893
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,296
Spend less money

1894
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,600
A ridiculous military

1895
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,904
And spend more of that on

1896
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,696
And people were like

1897
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:13,536
Maybe the wealthy don't need to have all of the money and we should

1898
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,560
Spread it around

1899
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,352
Those people are

1900
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,120
Demons

1901
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,424
Largely

1902
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,704
In his next clip

1903
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,264
More about some of these generals

1904
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,544
Did you talk to

1905
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Who have

1906
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,152
We're really doing Haley and stuff

1907
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:38,112
Whatever it is

1908
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:49,376
What's going on

1909
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:55,520
I don't they were f****** up Venezuela

1910
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:03,456

1911
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,272
Oh okay

1912
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,096
Operating system

1913
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,776
This is not of this world

1914
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,616
They're coming in

1915
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,576
Can have regulations

1916
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:42,112
The problem

1917
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,512
That's really xenophobe

1918
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,072
47k

1919
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,912
That's okay I'm going to take a stand here

1920
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,960
I think that's racist

1921
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,520
Against the whole galaxy

1922
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,384
I know he's racist towards

1923
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:10,784
Meijer his restraint has rations mantis beings and stuff like

1924
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:19,232
Generals ototo

Exactly

1928
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:32,544
What's the weather

1929
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,848
Is oftentimes makes connection with

1930
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,872
The world

1931
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,408
It's so much of these

1932
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,456
Ding Dongs on Project

1933
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:43,808
That relate to things Alex says

1934
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:49,696
Just overtly great program nonsense that we see

1935
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,816
You told me all about these raps

1936
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:02,240

Videos about help

1946
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:35,776
I'll tell you this right now they would not let up

1947
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,800
Let's have a pain in back

1948
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,616
He is definitely using a kranda right on his

1949
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,480
Sew-ins ex-wife Alex talks about

1950
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:48,320
He's afraid of

1951
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,600
He's such a coward

1952
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
Because

1953
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,488
I don't believe this they believe it

1954
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,304
You are you are expressing that you

1955
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,328
You believe this

1956
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:02,656
He literally just said it's interdimensional

1957
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:07,264
He said it multiple times yes absolutely this is what I believe

1958
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
He wants to freeze it more like

1959
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:10,848
Demons

1960
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,640
Yeah people might

1961
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
He's accepting

1962
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,552
I just think it's so cowardly that

1963
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Couching it with

1964
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,344
With like

1965
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,256

Claims

1969
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,680
It's full of s***

1970
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,728
Someone else said it

1971
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,032
No it's

1972
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,336
Dae what you mean Alex

1973
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,616

1974
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
You can glean

1975
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
Text Clues

1976
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,992
But there is an interdimensional invasion

1977
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,528
That is coming to Earth

1978
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,112
Whatever

1979
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,696
And there's a tree what is the difference

1980
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,768
That's what we're dealing with

1981
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,840
A broadcast

1982
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
Kill yourself kill yourself

1983
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:22,784

1984
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,344

1988
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:53,248
Good that it just gets cut off by

1989
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,040
More than

1990
01:52:55,552 --> 01:53:00,672
I love it and it almost H2 me a little bit more than even the Advil

1991
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:05,536
Eclipse

1992
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:11,936
Recovery is more funny to have him cut off in the middle of

1993
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:18,336
Brea

1994
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,616
The transmission coming

1995

So

1997
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:28,064
He said it's beginning this episode that Rogan is going to be on

1998
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
Adele

1999
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,368
The fact that he's not going

2000
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,768
But if you're coming

2001
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
So it's going to be a surprise

2002
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,376
Comstock

I'd want to get on today

2012
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,648
Why is it so important that you get on

2013
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,208
And silly talk some s*** about Joe Rogan

2014
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:10,304
Then Mike says

2015
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
Consider

2016
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,608
It's the way he's talking

2017
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,632
Implies that he

2018
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656
Listening

2019
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,192

01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,760
The health Ranger Mike Adams

2023
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:37,952
On the cosmic extermination agenda that you have been talkin about I just want to affirm

2024
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:41,024
You are 1%

2025
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:46,144
That the call has gone out to exterminate Humanity

2026
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:50,240
This is why they they love the idea of murdering Christians

2027
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,592
Murdering conservatives killing Trump they're all about death and execution

2028
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
Because the order has come down

2029
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,920

2039
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
How old are you

2043
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,544
That's true.

2044
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,824
Been so successful

2045
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:01,664
Cuz if you hear

2046
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Whatever

2047
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:13,440
Alien base

2048
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,792
Is not coming on the show

2049
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:19,328
Wright Tire

I'm going to host some of the next hour when I was Interview Joe Rogan

2051

Let's go ahead

2053
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:34,944
What's the truth

2054
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,856
Not satire

2055
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:43,136
Lying

2056
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:51,584
Cemetery Gates

2057
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,400
Riverwalk by those

2058
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,496
Anyway Alex is going to do this a bit

2059
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
About Rogue

2060
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,824
Without

2061
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,128
It's really not know

2062
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,712
I really don't think you understand

2063
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,736
The point

2064
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:09,760
Requires a

2065
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,600
Threat

2066
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,368
Thresholds

2067
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,928
Concept

2068
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,000
Just doing something that's not right

2069
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
Real

2070
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:21,536
Isn't

2071
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
Satire

2072
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
Right

2073
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,352
Like what

2074
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,888
Sure

2075
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,424
You're right.

2076
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:32,288
But I were three of the show

2077
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,616
He's been saying that Rogan is going to come on

2078
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,408
For a bit of the show

2079
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,432
Teasing and

2080
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,480
And sort of implying that he's not

2081
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,760
But also saying

2082
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:44,576
Rogan's going to be on

2083
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,648
What you do that's far or a hoax

2084
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,672
I would even accept

2085
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:55,072
If he says we're going to do a bit about Rogan

2086
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,632
That's not teasing something inappropriate

2087
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:00,448
He's hoping that some people think that Rogan

2088
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,984
Is actually going to be on

2089
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:05,056
In order to boost his ratings cuz he knows that Rogan is

2090
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:08,128
Is a bigger draw

2091
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
Get

2092
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:12,992
More eyes more ears on the show

2093
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,272
Hopefully to listen to

2094
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:16,832
The ads until the payoff comes

2095
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,880
But he's not going to be there

2096
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:21,696
And by that point

2097
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:28,096
Which is pink something that maybe Rodi Road maybe he doesn't do this

2098
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,680
Project

2099
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:35,520
He entices some of Rogan's listeners with that space talk

2100
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
Maybe

2101
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:40,896
Maybe he teases them with that carrot that he doesn't usually Django out

2102
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,664
Cuz he knows

2103
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,248
F****** b******* Neil deGrasse Tyson

2104
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
What if

2105
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:49,344
That would be a brutal

2106
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,112
Brutalx

2107
01:58:54,464 --> 01:59:00,608
Is that what's going on

2108
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,376
Last night

2109
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,192
Call

2110
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:09,056
Vision x i

2111
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,592
And phone off

2112
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,896
And I got the message this morning

2113
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,784
Apologized

2114
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:25,440
If I hurt your feelings didn't have you on but you're in a bad flyson

2115
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
You're mentally ill

2116
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,024
I don't buy that sounds

2117
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,608
That seems like the last

2118
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,376
Message

2119
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,400
From someone who's

2120
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,168
Trying

2121
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:37,216
Yep that

2122
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:42,080
That's a friendship breakup right there that's like hey man

2123
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:48,480
I care about you and I love you and I know we're not in Parkway more than Alex deserves

2124
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,016
Yeah like

2125
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:50,784

This like

2127
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,344
Wednesday message

2128
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
Winston Tower

2129
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,208
It was after Alex was on

2130
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:02,048
Political

2131
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
Apologize

2132
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:07,936
The times that I made

2133
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,704
Fun of you with

2134
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:15,616
Yeah

2135
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:17,664
Who's the performer that we're both in bed

2136
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,272
He did try and make that

2137
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,296
Clear

2138
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
Like to hear these

2139
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,136
Elements

2140
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,672
Responding

2141
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,208
Like with Josh

2142
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,232
Stone

2143
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,280
Like fuk

2144
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:39,168
Yeah this is turned into an episode of intervention

2145
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,472
Yeah it's it's it it sucks

2146
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,240
It sucks

2147
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:46,592
Alex way to tear your life apart around your eyes

2148
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,384
Good for you

2149
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,152
Things like

2150
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,224
This is one of the only people who would have gone to bat

2151
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,808
Free first ex-husband for f****** long time

2152
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:58,112
Now what reason you have to do this

2153
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:01,184
Whether it's your desperation

2154
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,208
4 rating

2155
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,000
Whether it's Owen Benjamin

2156
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,536
The bad advice

2157
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:10,400
Your own mental illness

2158
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:12,704
Because he was on

2159
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:13,984
Whatever

2160
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,520
This is the worst thing

2161
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,056
Possibly do like

2162
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,592
This guy cared about

2163
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,896
For no reason

2164
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,432
You didn't deserve that

2165
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:26,016
You didn't keep up that relationship over the years

2166
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,808
And he went to bat

2167
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:33,952
Was dumb to do that

2168
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:37,024
You was wrong

2169
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,048
The time be called

2170
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
Him out about

2171
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,912
What you learned about the

2172
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:44,960
How to tell

2173
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
Criticize

2174
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:52,640
Alex

2175
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:53,920
Because he'd known him

2176
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:56,480
Years and thought he knew the heart of

2177
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,248
The man

2178
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:58,528
It turns out

2179
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Rogan

2180
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,576
Didn't know the artist

2181
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
No clue

2182
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,160
If it's next clip Alex is pissed off

2183
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:06,720
Because Joe Rogan isn't even on his

2184
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:08,000
His goddamn weather

2185
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,072
I really don't

2186
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:14,144
Joe Rogan is so far above his level right now is in

2187
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,424
Bro

2188
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,704
Bro

2189
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,008
Back when Alex

2190
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,568
Like doing document

2191
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,104
That Millions

2192
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:23,872
Interviews

2193
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
Everyone locked up

2194
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:28,224
He was doing Fear Factor makeup

2195
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,552
And stuff like that is pretty funny though

2196
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:32,320
Yeah

2197
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,856
And I was going to try it

2198
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,392
Mix those two eyes

2199
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,696
I produce loose change

2200
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:43,072
Counter down had 187 million views on Google

2201
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,888
We got to stop that for a second

2202
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
He produced

2203
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
Loose change

2204
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:48,704
Final Cut

2205
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,520
There were multiple versions of loose change

2206
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,568
Before Alex even got involved

2207
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:58,432
I didn't either until months

2208
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:03,296
I always thought because Alex presented is like I was behind

2209
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:09,952
Dylan Avery and Jason bermas was involved

2210
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,280
Which is like the fifth version

2211
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:17,632
I did not know that he got a late

2212
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,400
Adopter

2213
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:22,752
Of loose change documentary

2214
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:25,568
Wow

2215
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,152
187 million views

2216
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:34,016
Donkey testicles on

2217
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:39,648
Billions and billions of these are worth

2218
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,672
I don't

2219
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:48,096
Good and sit down

2220
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,656
Do I get a tree

2221
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,984
Did you work on my radar

2222
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:56,288
When you pulled all this

2223
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,080
Tracking radar

2224
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,896
Targeting operation

2225
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,736
Extreme prejudice

2226
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
Headquarters

2227
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,024
Show Mom

2228
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:26,496
Because you see it's not just that you're on a higher Echelon evil

2229
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,776
You're almost there

2230
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,056
You are

2231
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,080
A good pic

2232
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,640
You're cleared to fire Joe

2233
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,712
That means your dad my sights

2234
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,808
Just about men. The man in me

2235
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:42,880
Be scaring you and those of you need to know

2236
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
Anderson

2237
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:52,608
I said Joe Rogan is going to be on the show today

2238
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:54,144
You lied you didn't joke

2239
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
It was a lie

2240
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,968
License Owen

2241
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:10,272
Joe Rogan

2242
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,832
It's all like

2243
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
This

2244
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,416
That's sad

2245
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,952
I'm sad

2246
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,584
Weird

2247
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,400
Stack

2248
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,168
Really

2249
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,448
This thing we do

2250
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,728
This episode because

2251
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:35,360
Devil versus the acro-cats of Alex

2252
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:38,432
It kind of feels different why

2253
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:45,344
I didn't know I could be this disappointed

2254
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,624
F***

2255
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,328
I don't know how to tell

2256
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
There

2257
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,656
There is a payoff

2258
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,936
To this episode

2259
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:06,080
We can cut

2260
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:08,896
Alex does interview fake jewelry

2261
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:10,688
Right

2262
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:11,712
And

2263
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:13,504
Did this is what I'm talking

2264
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,784
Is it him

2265
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,064
This payoff is

2266
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,624
Astro cats

2267
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,184
Claiming that they have a cat band

2268
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:22,976
Because like

2269
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,024
Did today

2270
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,048
The

2271
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,608
Is disposal

2272
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,400
She decided on the 5th

2273
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,936
That f****** Rogan is

2274
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,704
Is dead

2275
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,496
I'm going to destroy you

2276
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,288
Hasn't brought up

2277
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,824
Real substantial in

2278
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:39,104
Documents

2279
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,408
Proof of any of the claims that he's making

2280
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:45,504
These like Rogan is going to be

2281
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,832
At the top of the next hour

2282
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,112
Next hour comes

2283
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:52,672
He's going to be on later

2284
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:53,952
Are we getting out of

2285
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,744
Beginning of the fourth hour

2286
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,536
So it's the fourth hour

2287
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,584
He still on yeah

2288
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,424
Okay

2289
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,472
Via the host of the 4th hour

2290
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:07,008
To getting what he needs

2291
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,080
Nice thought I thought

2292
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,104
For sure is going to be

2293
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,128
F****** recorded

2294
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:14,688
I thought for sure

2295
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,504
Between the fifth

2296
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,272
6

2297
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
And recorded

2298
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,368
Some sort of dumb thing where it's like

2299
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:25,696
Hi I'm Alex. Are you cool

2300
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:26,976
Nah bro

2301
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:33,120
And splice it in

2302
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:35,168
You and your interns

2303
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:35,936
20 minute

2304
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,568
You take nothing

2305
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,360
This is what he did

2306
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,920
And it sucks

2307
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:50,272
License Ellen

2308
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,296
He's not and

2309
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:58,976
The Nazis

2310
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:13,568
Drunk

2311
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:16,896
Confirm

2312
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,808
Then the secretary want

2313
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,392
If you put coins into the snake

2314
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
Not

2315
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,032
That is fake news

2316
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:45,312
Is this bad

2317
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:48,384
I kind of want to exercise

2318
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,432
That leads to a

2319
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
Embarrassing

2320
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,016
Bet new donor level

2321
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:56,576
Sneakers

2322
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:00,160
I kind of actually really like that

2323
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,952
Events

2324
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,488
I don't think he's dead

2325
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,768
That is

2326
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:11,168
Children's book level for uninspired Rogan impression

2327
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,448
Doesn't sound anything like

2328
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:16,288
I know that I listen

2329
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,312
Gotcha

2330
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:21,152
Truffles

2331
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:32,160
I've never listen to Joe Rogan

2332
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
I find

2333
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
Most of them

2334
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:44,192
Duncan Trussell

2335
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:46,496
There's a ton of episodes

2336
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:53,664
Of episodes Good Company

2337
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,944
He's not a

2338
02:09:57,504 --> 02:10:01,856
He falls for what shifted say people with will or able to

2339
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
Thinking

2340
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,768
Because he doesn't have an editorial process to his body

2341
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:11,072
He assumes that everybody has

2342
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:12,864
Goodwill when they're talking

2343
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,912
What is Liars

2344
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
It Sancho

2345
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,008
Things

2346
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:25,664
It's just a problem

2347
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,432
You're saying thing

2348
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,272
He wants to believe that you know

2349
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,064
Too much trust

2350
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:36,416
I'm really good friends with Alex for a long time

2351
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,464
Do you have a certain lack of guile

2352
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:42,816
That the owner

2353
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:46,400
Or you've overblown what your friendship actually was

2354
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,168
Yeah

2355
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,448
Like his nose I mean

2356
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:50,496
Their friendship actually

2357
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,264
We was

2358
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,568
Lav

2359
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:55,616
4 years Gas Austin

2360
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,944
How many times do they f*** you fucken take the axle

2361
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:05,344
We talked every time comes through Austin

2362
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:07,392
Fast

2363
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:12,256
Alex never leaves off except for the times he does publicity stunt

2364
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,280
Or

2365
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:19,680
Very specific publicity stunt

2366
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,704
YouTube Meetup

2367
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:22,752
They're not good

2368
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,800
Friend friendship

2369
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:25,824
Space

2370
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:29,152
The time that they've been friend

2371
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:33,504
You've been friends for twenty years so they've been friends for 20 years

2372
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:35,552
It's not like you actually been

2373
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:37,600
Befriend for those 20

2374
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:40,416
Right

2375
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,184
Isn't sincere

2376
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,488
Possibly

2377
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,512
Pretend to understand

2378
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,584
We have done

2379
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,376
Right do each other behind

2380
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:52,192
It strikes me as

2381
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:55,776
Rogan's

2382
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,056
About this

2383
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
Yep

2384
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:04,736
Expectation is like what their relationship was

2385
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:09,856
Yeah yeah that's exactly right I was being a sneaky snake

2386
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,928
Knows the joke and help

2387
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,232
Now you should know

2388
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,768
Alex Jones

2389
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Ism

2390
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,816
Cannot be bought

2391
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:22,144
You think I want to be part of your system

2392
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:25,216
When I want to burn you down

2393
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:28,032
Triple-S

2394
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,312
Alex Jones

2395
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:34,176
If it is sold out

2396
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,968
I shine.

2397
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:46,976
Like you so much I can't believe I'm dirty rags I can't believe

2398
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:50,048
We have specials on gold right now

2399
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,096
Every moment

2400
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,376
That podcast

2401
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:58,496
You attacked these people and you take it to them all the way maybe I let you be with us

2402
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,288
I like yes sir

2403
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,360
What kind of Goddard

2404
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,176
Okay

2405
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,456
Joe

2406
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:11,296
You're all trying to take DMT and get in contact with little floating

2407
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,832
Retard demons

2408
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,368
From the pit of Hell

2409
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:17,440
I just want you to know Joe that there's a hole

2410
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,720
Another dimension

2411
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:21,280
And then on from that and you're just

2412
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,560
Not making the cut

2413
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:28,448
You see Joe Rogan walking around

2414
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,752
Sure

2415
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:35,360
Maybe he's got platform shoes.

2416
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,408
Like elevator

2417
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:41,504
I know you're walking around heaven

2418
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:50,464
Oh my God I thought it was

2419
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,424
Spaceship weather's battles

2420
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,496
Terrifying

2421
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,848
I really think he thinks hired two men

2422
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,128
Beans like up

2423
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:15,040
It does seem that way seems like he thinks golf vertical

2424
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:17,344
Dimensional view of higher dimension

2425
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,368
If you will

2426
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:20,160
You think you see

2427
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:20,928
Joe Rogan

2428
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:28,096
If he's wearing platform shoes is that good

2429
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:30,656
Also thanks

2430
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:39,616
Seems like a real upgrade

2431
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:44,480
Super Mario

2432
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,552
I've already been

2433
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,856
That sort of s*** like

2434
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:54,976
Dude

2435
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,000
I think so

2436
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:02,144
Whatever

2437
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:03,680
This is creepy

2438
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:05,728
One more clip

2439
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:09,056
When you were talking about

2440
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,592
This is all

2441
02:15:11,872 --> 02:15:12,384
Give me your money

2442
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,712
This is where

2443
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:18,784
Alex

2444
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:20,832
Probably

2445
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:22,624
Feeling that he's going to go out of

2446
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:25,184
And on the end of the six

2447
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,232
We get through

2448
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:28,000
Prestige

2449
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,280
Reveal

2450
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
Of likewise

2451
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,328
Keeps

2452
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,352
S***

2453
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:34,144
On Unbroken

2454
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,424
Yeah

2455
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,704
These people to come in

2456
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:37,984
And keep watering

2457
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:38,752
Coffers

2458
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,544
Because this

2459
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:41,568
Next clip

2460
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,104
Is the real

2461
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,128
Did he live there

2462
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:45,664
This is reality

2463
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:47,968
Tell you right now

2464
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,248
That job

2465
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:54,112
Launch all the new stuff

2466
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,696
I'll just tell Rodger in front of God country

2467
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,024
Rodger Stone

2468
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,632
Eminem

2469
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:18,944
My God going to bless our bank accounts while we can't advertise online

2470
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,040
I want to bet on a lizard

2471
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:27,648
Well then you just better yourself in Wizard because Infowars is a standard

2472
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,672
In the fight

2473
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:31,232
It seems the symbol a signal

2474
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:34,304
Logo AAA

2475
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:35,584
Needs Lionel's

2476
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,120
So raspy voice

2477
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:44,544
20

2478
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,824
4 years old

2479
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,152
And a six-shot of me is just like

2480
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:54,272
The responsibilities of like earlier in the morning easier than I ever did

2481
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:05,536
You got

2482
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:08,608
Attack robot

2483
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,400
Play the flesh and blood

2484
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:11,168
That is

2485
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:13,472
Completely committed to finding lovely

2486
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,104
And the media and system

2487
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:21,920
If you don't put fuel

2488
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:23,200
In the jet tag

2489
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:27,552
Come on come on land on land that money bomb

2490
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:35,488
But I want to drop

2491
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,304
Weapons information weapons

2492
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:43,680
My lawyer told me that engaged

2493
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,704
Until

2494
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:47,008
The cows come home but I need

2495
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:51,616
We already have great products

2496
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,200
Turbo Force through Friday

2497
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,224
Wolf

2498
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,760
50%

2499
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:04,928
This is Patrick

2500
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:07,232
Roast

2501
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,512
Because it's so

2502
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,072
And it is a it's a good strategy

2503
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:14,912
Trying to attack Rogan

2504
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,448
And make it look like

2505
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:18,496
Hey we're going to have a war with each other

2506
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:19,776
The only thing

2507
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,848
Subvert that possibility

2508
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:24,896
Rogan doesn't

2509
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:28,992
Respond I hope that he responds to it the way you were saying

2510
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:30,016
That's crazy

2511
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:30,784
That's

2512
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:32,064
Clearly intercept

2513
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:36,160
No

2514
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,696
And that everyone

2515
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:39,232
Sort of.

2516
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:43,584
I've seen so many goddamn posts on Twitter

2517
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,352
In Facebook

2518
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,400
People messaging me about it

2519
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:47,424
Just like that

2520
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,984
I want to tell them all

2521
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:51,520
Roulette

2522
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,544
Kool-Aid

2523
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:55,104
I wish I wish there was a better way to say this

2524
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:56,896
Get your instinct

2525
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,688
Migrants

2526
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:01,248
Cuz you need to understand how these

2527
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,016
People who

2528
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,552
Havel will operate

2529
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:06,112
Disney troll operation

2530
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:06,880
John

2531
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,160
Large-scale

2532
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,720
What is stoic

2533
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:13,024
Interesting

2534
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:14,560
It's so interesting.

2535
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:19,424
Layering war on

2536
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,192
Joe Rogan

2537
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,776
Alex's listeners

2538
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:27,360
Have been aware

2539
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,712
They listen to Alex's show

2540
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:34,528
They hear him go

2541
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:36,064
Start a war

2542
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,624
So then they listen to the next episode

2543
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,928
Asthma-like how is Joe gunners

2544
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:44,000
And then because the listeners of

2545
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:47,584
Wait this is two episodes of him

2546
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,888
Until then they go and listen to Alex's show

2547
02:19:50,912 --> 02:19:55,008
Whole f****** goalie and Alex is willing to destroy what is

2548
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,544
Probably a meeting list

2549
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:05,760
Joann

2550
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:07,552
In the first episode

2551
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:08,320
I don't like you

2552
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:09,600
Yep

2553
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,160
Guilty that I ever like

2554
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,440
That's

2555
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,720
F******

2556
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:19,328
So he's just going to try and keep needling Joe until Joe response

2557
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:25,216
Video

2558
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:25,984
You're right

2559
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,008
It's the ideas

2560
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,288
Go bounce back

2561
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:31,616
Put

2562
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:32,384
What

2563
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:34,176
The benefit

2564
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,200
Of it is

2565
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:36,224
The bounce back

2566
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,760
It comes to

2567
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:39,040
Going to be

2568
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:40,832
Nose

2569
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,368
The people will probably go listen

2570
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,392
The Rogan show

2571
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:44,928
Anthurium care

2572
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:45,952
Driving traffic

2573
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:48,000
Is them right if the two of them

2574
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:49,024
Hot Feud

2575
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:51,584
Doesn't matter if they both get over

2576
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,352
Using breast

2577
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:55,680
Hanover in the process

2578
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:57,216
I'm still f****** over

2579
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:01,312
I might have lost the feud or whatever black get over

2580
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
Right in the process

2581
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:03,872
Pathetic

2582
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:05,152
But I

2583
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:06,688
Just pray I pray

2584
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:08,224
You don't

2585
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,016
But I I would hope

2586
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,552
Rogator no batteries

2587
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,368
I will say this

2588
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:23,072
The canary in the coal mine

2589
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:23,840
It's

2590
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,216
I want to say at the end I don't really know

2591
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:30,496
How much value

2592
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:33,568
This holds I don't know if this was a great episode

2593
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,360
But it was

2594
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,456
Like really getting back

2595
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,248
Jumping back into

2596
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,528
To Alex

2597
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,576
I thought

2598
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:45,600
Is that this

2599
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:47,136
Was more import

2600
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
State of the Union

2601
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,816
Enso

2602
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:55,840
This is

2603
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:58,656
I have to drive this message

2604
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,680
Home very

2605
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:02,496
Don't fall for tricks

2606
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,312
Is alteryx

2607
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
You want to see

2608
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:08,640
Trolling

2609
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,552
Communal what

2610
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:27,072
Probably from another

2611
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:29,376
F****** novel

2612
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:36,288
No it's spelled with an i

2613
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:37,312
Scrum

2614
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:43,712
Sue Dickens

2615
02:22:50,368 --> 02:22:54,976
Dickensheet

2616
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:02,912
My whole position on this has stopped

2617
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,704
Yep that's that's what I would say

2618
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:11,104
We have about strong episodes coming up next week

2619
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:12,896
In the work

2620
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,944
Don't have the bird

2621
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,760
Of my vacation

2622
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:19,552
I appreciate everyone enjoying

2623
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:20,576
I'm sure

2624
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:27,232
Back to regular knowledge fight

2625
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,352
And

2626
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:39,776
I keep wanting to spoil things

2627
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:41,568
Website

2628
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,336

Technically probably never killed

2668
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:21,824
I bet he hasn't murdered anybody

2669
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:25,408

2670
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:32,320

02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:02,272
