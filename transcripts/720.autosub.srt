1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
College fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nick.com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Worship at the altar of Selena

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,424
Alex Jones

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
Sup today is

8
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Coca-Cola

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Coca-Cola classic or newco

10
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,064
Podcast noted Lee famous

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Critical

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Of their space flight

13
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:36,000
They came out with that space flavor no concept of a Coca-Cola Space Universe

14
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
Supposed to taste like

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,592
I got only way I could find that was in like a six-pack of minicamp

16
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Wright still in my fridge

17
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
No interest in drinking down there

18
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
They're garbage

19
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
Coke put out another flavor called Dreamworld

20
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
Which is supposed to be the flavor of Dreams

21
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm sorry whatever the f*** they're doing I guess it's some kind of viral marketing campaign it must get enough attention

22
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,168
Like based on how these ideas

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
You know people talk about eikyou with

24
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,032
The flavor of space saver 3

25
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
You know I think that's

26
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
I think they're dissecting Travis Scott's AstroWorld you know cuz that's a mixture of

27
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
Yeah well I mean you got a you got space and you got Dreamworld

28
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
Put them together you got AstroWorld

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
I think that dream world was much more of us

30
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
Success

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,232
Pretty good

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,352
Kind of a passion fruit kind of vibe to it

33
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
Coca-Cola mixed with a certain

34
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Do there's maybe a couple of fruit

35
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,616
Kind of feeling better let me ask you the ultimate question those did they itchy you a taste

36
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
That would remind you of a dream

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
I guess

38
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
World do you dream of passion fruit

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Right on the nose all right if not then maybe not I don't know I have no interest

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,976
Assessing the accuracy of flavors

41
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,024
I will just say that it's pretty alright

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
Who is the taste tester for Dreamworld

43
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,776
Did active the rapper dream date

44
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:29,920
Anyway I appreciate the salvaged what was the last of that shattered reputation

45
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
The Dreamworld

46
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Yes what about you

47
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,856
For me it's a new album out by jid

48
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Tastic album okay

49
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Excellent album

50
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
It's one of those things

51
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Kingswear

52
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Maybe only an outside critic

53
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Can kind of look at Subway on

54
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
And then accelerated to a high extent so this is like jid

55
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
Looked at Kendrick's last album I was like

56
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
What if I did the most tender

57
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
You know in like Kendrick can do the most Kendrick kids would say hold my beer right

58
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Something that it's almost also a little bit of an omage

59
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
Combined with a little bit of a parity in a way

60
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
You know it's just like

61
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Taking out a lot of Kendrick

62
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,047
I'm really hammering it home like he's changing time signatures every 5 Seconds changes voices

63
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
You got characters going on

64
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
This is Kendrick is s***

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
You know that's what he's doing

66
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Right but it's really good

67
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
I'll check it out that's Matt we can't check it out I've started to exercise

68
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
I'm listening to a bit of music and I will save it

69
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Stuck

70
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
L2

71
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
I don't think that would have helped me up and I got deep into a

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
I don't know

73
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,839

76
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,847
I'm going to leave this here

77
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,247
Snakes on a Plane by Cobra Starship was alright

78
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015

I wanted self-care comes in all sorts of shapes

85
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
Sizes and varieties haven't just decided today

86
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
I was going to back 2000

87
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Because I wanted to

88
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903

Something to talk

97
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087

Excited to go over this and discuss some of the b******* that Alex was doing on this day back in 2000

108
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351

Got to hear tomorrow

00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
And you never see me again

140
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Back here again

141
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
I apologized

00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
Start yesterday

00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439

00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Thank you

145
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Mount Jordan

146
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,119
Yes we have an out-of-context drop

147
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Population

148
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,311
The basic yes yeah yes

149
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
This is great

150
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,991
If Alex has very frequently talked about how big is audience

151
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
10% of the world

152
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Yeah

153
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
This this was a new level of brag

154
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
What the heck

155
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
6%

156
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:47,007
Of the of the web traffic and then there's Infowars MMA

157
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Banking information

158
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
One out of every 10 paid hits

159
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
Wow wow I've ever you know when you think about that do you think those Google search results and they bring back

160
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
A billion

161
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
Results you know in like a second or whatever

162
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
That means it's roughly

163
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
10% of those are Infowars articles of some sort

164
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
He has a lot of tentacles

165
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
Until maybe all of these websites

166
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:25,151
Every p******* part of Infowars

167
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
These Diversified

168
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
And that does seem like a back door

169
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
Some enterprising reporter language

170
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
So let's jump into today's contact

171
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
Go with a major world news story

172
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Alia Bhatt

173
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Was another global

174
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
So for some perspective

175
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
This episode is from August 6th

176
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,479
And the bombing of the Marriott in Jakarta happened on August

177
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
East 5th

178
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,807
Well there is no preponderance of any evidence

179
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,903
Completing Alex to say it's looking like a globalist plot you just literally says that about every

180
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,231
I was wondering what the globalist plot in this regard

181
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
Well I mean okay if the globalist plot but what is their plot Beyond just they decided to blow up this

182
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
Oh okay

183
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
So it goes like this

184
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
The globalist

185
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
Are attacking

186
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Sort of Western etarget

187
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
Indonesia hotel chains

188
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,575
Write in order to force the hand of the Indonesian government

189
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
To playing along with their globalist takeover and crack down on the public install a martial law

190
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
Indonesia so goes the work

191
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,983
Classic cig the Sun never fell on the Indonesian Marriott chain

192
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah I believe is what it says yet essentially the plot the plot is

193
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
To try and force the hand of the government

194
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
2

195
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
To go along with her blow up all your McDonald's

196
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Basically

197
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,647
Okay so incidentally these two bombings that Alex is talking about working

198
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,487
As they were both carried out by members of the terrorist group Jamal

199
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Islamia

200
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
Members of the group or were convicted of doing

201
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
String of bombings in Bali

202
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
There were a couple that in that in that attack

203
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,311
Sure and it's pretty clearly established that they were behind the Jakarta bombing as well

204
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
What are the more persuasive pieces of evidence that was found was the head

205
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,271
Love the suicide bomber which was identified by multiple sources as being a man

206
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Sunny

207
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Who was a member of j i

208
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,951
I'm guessing Alex good to say that that was planted there or something because he's smart and he loves back

209
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Ivy

210
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
Did you just say what I heard you say and that's

211
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Like we're going to be fine with that

212
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,239
I'm so the suicide bomber went into a hotel and blew himself up

213
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
Well I believe it was a car bomb

214
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Okay

215
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Still

216
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
But

217
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
Of all the things that were intact

218
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
His head was identifiable

219
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Yeah yeah yeah

220
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Crazy

221
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Intex is a is a way to put it

222
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
Ikea

223
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
We're not talkin dental records

224
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,887
Like it literally sounds like somebody walked by there like holyshit it's him

225
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
How have you been

226
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:07,871
Yeah it was other members of the the group who had been arrested identified him

227
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
I don't want to be

228
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Morbid right

229
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
It is wild

230
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Aridity

231
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
No I don't I don't disagree

232
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
That's wild

233
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
And that's probably why Alex would say it's fake

234
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Probably wouldn't do something like that

235
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Because

236
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,383
Your response is what people how people would respond to it yeah it was something a little bit

237
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
I would be very suspicious yes

238
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
Yeah so jamaat-e-islami I was a terrorist organization that operated in Indonesia

239
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,743
Mostly inspired by opposition to the more moderate forms of Islam that were practiced there

240
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
This was

241
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
Seen as a form of Western degradation so they targeted things associated with the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta

242
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
That largely tourist area

243
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
In Bali where the bombings have

244
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Right the group

245
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,431
I had received funds from an organization called all haramein which is a charity that had clear ties to Al-Qaeda

246
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,319
But I remain did engaging a bunch of legitimate charity work some of the funds were dispersed

247
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
The terrorist groups like jamaat-e-islami ah

248
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
Which led to the charity being shut down in 2004

249
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Yeah yeah

250
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,327
Is a charity organization that is based in Riyadh Saudi Arabia

251
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
The point is that Alex is legitimately just talkin

252
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,751
He hasn't had time to come up with any conclusions or way the preponderance of evidence

253
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,871
But he can't resist the opportunity to blame this tragedy on his imagined enemies

254
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,247
And incorporate that made-up story Into His larger conspiracy worldview and so keys

255
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Saying that there's a preponderance of evidence

256
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Right

257
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Just saying

258
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
I mean I think this is interesting

259
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Insofar as

260
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,815
It feels like this is one of the few times where the plan in real life has been in

261
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Exactly as bad as Alex

262
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
This is fake globalist

263
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,423
How do you mean I mean

264
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
It's just

265
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Tactically I don't think that's going to achieve what it is but they think they're trying to achieve you know what I'm saying

266
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
No one no one

267
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,295
No one is going to care if you blow up a Marriott I'm sorry

268
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,879
I think people did

269
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Haha

270
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
Like it's a low-level Target

271
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,535
You're not going to get what you want out of the Marriott

272
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,071
Conceivably

273
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
One of the reasons

274
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Statues that is that it

275
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Frequent it by tourists

276
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
And foreign Nationals

277
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
And it would cause

278
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
A

279
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
A reduction of Western tourism to the Western influence possibly business

280
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
This is would be scared of

281
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,551
Coming in Europe there are ripple effect that you could

282
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Could think

283
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Might be

284
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Be achieved by attacking these Western Target

285
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:06,303
I don't know if I think the idea is as bad as you are thinking it is

286
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
I respect is a terrible idea I can understand the thought process

287
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
Gets there

288
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Is a lot

289
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,407
So we are I think see it I see it I'm just it this is just one of those

290
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
It plots

291
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
Ultimately that has been

292
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Tried before

293
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
And it doesn't really

294
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
You know it doesn't really do it

295
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
That's just not how you you got to get you got to get a good one

296
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,487
Well Hope Springs Eternal

297
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Zoe

298
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Trying to nail down exactly like where this conspiracy

299
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
He comes from or what Alex is

300
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Basing this on

301
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
We get 21

302
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Fairly

303
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Relevant

304
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Peace

305
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Good morning

306
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
4 Hour

307
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Before

308
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Not

309
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Warren

310
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,831
The Belize government I think it's Alex thinking the Bali is its own country if I remember

311
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,903
Tunisia

312
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Alex Simpson

313
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
I don't know what he's doing

314
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,375
So infused with Alex is going to do to try and make this conspiracy steak is work with the idea that there was some kind of advanced

315
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
Warning of the bombings

316
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
They were feds on the ground

317
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
Immediately

318
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
As always this stuff is

319
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Partially true

320
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,615
There were federal agents there but not USA

321
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:33,759
There were two groups from the Australian federal police who were working with the Indonesian law in for

322
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:39,135
One on a Narcotics operation and one on an anti-human trafficking task force

323
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
They were able to respond to the bombing

324
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
Mbali considering that they were already there in the country

325
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,887
But this isn't suspicious and it doesn't prove anything close to a conspiracy or false flag

326
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
And again

327
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
This is related to the 2002 Raleigh bombings I posted the Jakarta bombing that just had

328
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
Happened that Alex's

329
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
Discover a different situation playing fast and loose

330
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
These details a little bit and I think it's intentional

331
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
So there was some Advance warning but that's not not necessarily a thing where it was specific enough to guarantee the

332
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,231
Ability to stop either the Bali bombings or the Jakarta bombing before they happen

333
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
In the case of the Bali attacks the US

334
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:23,935
Captured Omar Al Farooq who was understood to be a high-level Al-Qaeda operative in the region

335
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
His contact information has been found in the possession of number of senior members of the group and after the US forces in

336
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,663
Irrigated hemenway's it almost certainly bordered on torture

337
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,759
He talked and explain his role in the Southeast Asian sell of al-Qaeda

338
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
The US attempted to pass this intelligence onto the Indonesian government because part of it involved a reasonable suspicion that they

339
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
They were planning an attack somewhere near the anniversary of 9/11

340
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,607
What are the recommendations that the u.s. made was that the government should arrest

341
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,679
The prominent cleric named Abu bakar Bashir

342
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
Who al-farooq had named as being someone who was involved

343
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,823
In the organization and planning of attack

344
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,895
The political situation in Indonesia the time was

345
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Was very tense

346
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
What's with a secular president of megawati

347
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,551
Sukarno putri who's vice president

348
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
Hamza has said to have close ties with many of the radicals of the US wanted to focus on including

349
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Beshear

350
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,304
Do you have this vice president

351
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
President who was on the other side Erica Ware

352
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,800
Like it would just be the top to voters get in so it'd be piano

353
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,408
This guy and then the guy who hates him the most on the planet is the vice

354
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
It's a tough situation to navigate

355
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,832
The country is majority Muslim and megawati didn't want to make any arrests

356
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Particularly of religion

357
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
Just figures about evidence of their haven't committed a crime

358
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Switch bus

359
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Couldn't provide

360
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,352
The warning that the US had was too vague to be actionable in the Indonesian government was somewhat in a bind

361
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
Ultimately the Bali bombing

362
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,264
Could not be stopped but afterwards the megawati government began to act

363
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,616
Be arrested but she ran with a string of church bombing

364
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
He said he'd been involved in that occurred on Christmas Eve

365
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
You're 2000

366
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
Scaccia in the lead-up to the

367
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:19,648
Jakarta bombing Australian federal police were still in the country because the government had asked for their assistants investigating

368
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Volleyball

369
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
In the course of that investigation many members of jamaat-e-islami oh were arrested and questioned

370
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
And a picture began to take shape

371
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
That another bombing was being planned but no one provided

372
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
The specific Target they were planning to hit

373
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
Just that it was likely that the group would attack a soft

374
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Target

375
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
If that's all you have to go on

376
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
You can be on guard somewhat be

377
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
You can't possibly deploy the resources necessary

378
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
Attack every soft target in the country

379
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
Or even

380
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
All of them just in Jakarta

381
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,928
Well I mean yeah it is it is a warning that says bombing is coming

382
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,048
But without where or what or whom you or how to stop it

383
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
So you're like

384
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Well yeah but what do I do with

385
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
Right now

386
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,496
The notion that like a soft target would be chosen

387
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Isn't really that much

388
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
The new information of revelatory because

389
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
The original bombing

390
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
Was of a bar

391
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
You know

392
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
It's okay

393
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,248
Then you kind of get the sense that that's

394
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
In the

395
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
The mo I mean even then that's not really good in

396
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
Intelligence there because like oh well

397
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,048
You could just be assuming that they're going after a soft target or you don't even really know what is

398
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Soft target

399
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
Too damn quiet house off this song

400
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
Stuff Tactical

401
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,872
Nothing you saying means anything and he refuses to take responsibility for the things that he says

402
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,224
He just throws it at the wall and then moves on to another room for anyone can make

403
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
Can clean up his mess

404
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
None of this is

405
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
It has any connection to

406
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
The reality of the situation

407
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,672
He's blurring details

408
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
Intentionally or because he doesn't know any better about

409
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
Two different incident

410
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
I mean you don't even understand

411
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,216
He's a he's got people on the ground with the bali's as we speak you know like he's he's there

412
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:15,872
He overthrew the ball leaves government

413
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Country album

414
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,760
Steve is notably part of the body of sovereignty movement

415
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Make sense

416
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
So Alex has some other news stories he wants to hit on

417
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
This wasn't a story that was in the guardian the day prior

418
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
This is an article from September 6th

419
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,504
2002 in the aftermath of the Bali bombing

420
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
Right whenever they did know stuff

421
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
About a thing

422
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
The basic gist of the story is this

423
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,256
In November 2002 British citizen named Christopher rodway was killed in a car bombing

424
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,096
He was an engineer employed at the military Hospital in Riyadh

425
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
And in the immediate aftermath of the Saudi government said that this was not terrorism but was actually more likely a personal matter

426
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:53,152
At the time Saudi Arabia had a public stance that it was very insistent that they did not have any terrorist elements

427
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
Existing in the country

428
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,040
And this would contradict that narrative so there was an attempt to find another explanation

429
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
When personal reasons didn't stick a bunch of employees at the British Embassy were accused of carrying out that bombing with the goal of blaming

430
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
The Saudi Arabian government

431
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,376
Seven people were held in prison for long stretches treated quite poorly and a couple of them were actually sentenced to death

432
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
Before ultimately being released

433
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
This is a story that Alex is completely wrong about and if you just go a little bit further down the story he's using it

434
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,456
The credibility of these accusations being made by the government of Saudi Arabia might seem a little shot

435
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Quote

436
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:35,136
A guardian investigation this you're discredited the case against the men and uncovered evidence of systematic torture by the Menace

437
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
History of internal

438
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
According to Defence papers submitted by way of appeal

439
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
Do the Saudi Supreme Court last month

440
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
And seen by The Guardian

441
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
The men were systematically tortured until they confess

442
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:53,312
They were subjected to sleep deprivation for up to 10 days at a time suspended from chains hanging from hooks

443
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
Above their cell doors and repeatedly beat

444
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:01,760
They were told their relatives would be harmed if they did not cooperate and we're offered early release in exchange for concessions

445
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
At this point I want to make totally clear that I'm opposed to this treatment of detainees in the same way that I'm against how the US treated Omar

446
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Al-farooq

447
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,024
In the latter case it was interrogation tactics

448
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
Like sleep deprivation

449
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
The allegations in this case are far more

450
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Abusive incruse

451
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:24,544
The fact remains that these are abusive and unacceptable on both counts

452
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,896
And I'm not trying to minimize one compared to the other or anything they're both unacceptable

453
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,272
Beyond the moral issues putting someone into distress is not a reliable way to gather information

454
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:40,928
You may end up getting until this accurate but you also might not so it's often B best practice to not

455
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,256
View the fruits of tortured interrogations is being Trust

456
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
The reason that I gave this

457
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Much more of a pass in the case of al-farooq

458
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,472
Then then in the case of the

459
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
Play with the Saudi government blaming the British

460
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Citizen

461
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,664
Is because there were other corroborating details and pieces of supporting evidence

462
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
In that case but didn't come from al-farouq himself

463
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
And it appears of the things that he told the US forces were accurate Dave did their best to verify that information as opposed to

464
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
To just going

465
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
Oh we tortured him enough that we've got the correct

466
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
Information

467
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,560
Terrible

468
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
Awful

469
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
In early 2004 the British Embassy workers who were tortured and forced to admit to crimes they didn't commit on video buganda

470
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,032
The process of trying to sue the Saudi government

471
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,848
The rules at that point in the UK where that you couldn't

472
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,432
Sue a sovereign government but their case sucked a challenge that law

473
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
Actually want a case on this in 2004 but it was

474
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Ultimately overturned by a higher Court in 2000

475
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,112
Answer the

476
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Did not

477
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
What a what a weird

478
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:49,792
World that we live in where you can just get swept up into

479
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,888
Something that has nothing to do with you and then your tortured for like

480
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
That's absurd

481
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,984
It is very very dumb that that

482
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,008
Just exist

483
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
Don't we all

484
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Dissipate in this system

485
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
Yes very silly

486
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Reading

487
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Some of the folks

488
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
Experience. Not so much

489
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
I mean obviously

490
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Tails of being beaten in

491
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,184
The experience of having your government not have your back

492
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
Feeling like that

493
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Yeah

494
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Interesting

495
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
Expressions of the trauma that lingers

496
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
Bev B added

497
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Did to bye-bye like well there's no recourse really have

498
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
Hurricane just went through your house and

499
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
That's it

500
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,200
Hurricane just went through your house

501
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Now you have to live with it

502
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Bye-bye

503
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah yeah

504
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
It's f***** up

505
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Undoubtedly

506
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
So

507
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
There wasn't something that Alex

508
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
Touchstone

509
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
A little bit he said that they pulled them out

510
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
They pulled.

511
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,192
Yeah it's some of that was not not entirely clear based on

512
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
The peace

513
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,032
Pieces of information and the sources that he was citing

514
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
I am so you gets back to that and there's a little more clarity

515
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
And Other Stories

516
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656
Security

517
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Connected

518
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,200
So this story actually makes total sense if you understand the larger context of what's going on

519
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,088
It's only suspicious if you're only given access to the sparse details that Alex covers on his show

520
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
The sparseness of the details actually a strategic aspect of Alex's broadcast because he's not interested in giving his audience a better grass

521
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Facebook news events

522
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,888
He's just trying to find tiny slivers of information that he can use to make every of that conform to his pre

523
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Predetermined storyline

524
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,264
Everything fits neatly into the the globalist there behind everything box

525
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,360
This article that Alex is talking about it's from late 2000

526
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
The context of this is that the US intelligence

527
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
Community have gotten information from al-farouq

528
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,600
And other sources that there was a plan in motion to carry out a bombing in Indonesia

529
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:27,488
Areas or buildings that were seen as western or prime targets for groups like Jamia islamia

530
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:32,352
So they had every reason to suspect that a c's or government buildings could be under threat

531
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:39,008
Do you want to try to relay this information to the megawati government who found themselves unable to act in it

532
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Moana in a way that satisfied us

533
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,872
Concerned a few options on the table for how to proceed

534
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
Evacuating South temporarily is a completely Justified and rational

535
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,504
Decision to make in this situation

536
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,320
And it's definitely not cause for any kind of Suspicion

537
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:58,976
Alex is trying to use this sliver of information that the USA considered evacuating Embassy staff prior to the bomb

538
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Going to insinuate

539
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,096
That they had specific for knowledge of the attack but this doesn't stand up to scrutiny

540
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:10,752
It's also kind of dumb considering that if they did have foreknowledge of the attacks Target

541
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
They wouldn't have had to worry about

542
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Officials at their office

543
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
The primary target of that

544
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
Attack in Bali was Patty's Pub

545
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
A bar that was frequent by tourist

546
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:25,600
Though there was a smaller bomb that was detonated at the US Consulate office as well share share

547
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
One person sustained minor injuries

548
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,256
Is and it happened around 11 p.m. so most people probably weren't even at that office

549
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,888
According to the Australian police report the consulate bomb in Bali was packed with s***

550
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
So the

551
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:44,288
The thinking was that this was less aimed at killing people or causing destruction as much as it was a statement bombing

552
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,432
You know yeah you fella bum with s*** whenever you're trying to cover everybody with s*** I feel like that makes a perfect

553
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Yeah

554
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Yeah it's so this

555
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Doesn't

556
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
Work the analysis again trying to

557
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:58,880
Apply it

558
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
More broadly to the

559
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,280
The bombing that he's covering that is not appropriate

560
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Right

561
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,656
All right it is he sounds places that are geographically close

562
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
I bet it's been like well obviously all vomiting

563
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
Things happen in this geographical area happen for the

564
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:22,432
The exact same reason every time every detail about circumstances are exactly the same

565
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
Pose things and it's fine

566
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,624
You know Daddy's that is a really interesting failing that kind of goes under the radar with

567
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
It's a lot of his conspiracies like

568
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
It is impossible

569
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,328
To pull off the same job the same way over and over and over and over

570
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
Daddy's is it that was too suspicious that they never f****** and Ina in like unique and interesting

571
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Ways they're always able to pull it off

572
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
Yep that's crazy

573
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
It's it's

574
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,576
Anime is perfect

575
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,976
Theory of good is perfect you're just you're making up your enemy

576
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,376
Of course the power that you need them to have at any given point

577
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
It's

578
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Narrative

579
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,568
Convenience character Shield

580
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Shield

581
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:29,248
So Alex goes on to make up more details about this article that I think it's just the way he does this is

582
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Is just fascinating

583
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
On Muslim

584
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Across the archipelago

585
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
For you at

586
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Speaker

587
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Bar

588
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Ordered it

589
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
Of the Marriott four hours

590
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
The complete picture

591
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Alex is creating out of this article that he's reading

592
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,800
This article was written long before the Jakarta bombing at the Marriott and had to do with the US threat to remove m

593
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Embassy employees in 2000

594
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
2 prior to the Bali bombing

595
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,272
Do you ask didn't end up evacuating staff and it had nothing to do with that Marriott which is the hotel.

596
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Spell Target in

597
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Start up

598
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,672
The reason that Indonesian have speaker tenjune was expressing regret with the US

599
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,792
Decision to threaten to remove was because he was worried about the message that would send to the rest of the world

600
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,096
Did Indonesia wasn't the safe place to be

601
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
He was concerned with the country's reputation which

602
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
Make sense

603
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
How does no idea what he's talk

604
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,360
He's reporting that the US plan to evacuate staff hours before the bombing that happened in August 2000

605
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,504
Brief and his sources an article from October 2002 that is an issue

606
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
Or at least that's how it appears

607
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Well I mean because he's actually

608
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,976
Conflating sources he's making a stew

609
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
Okay

610
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
I mean

611
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
The whole here is

612
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
What

613
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Amount of us

614
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
Officials were at the Marriott

615
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,360
Like why are they why is the United States government like specifically like listen

616
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,968
We obviously would be like they know that the embassy is going to be bombed

617
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
But who all was staying at the Marriott that needed to be evacuate

618
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,880
The Marriott did host

619
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Like some of them

620
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,440
Like they had

621
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Sure head

622
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
No I mean yeah

623
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
Pass

624
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,352
It is it is a little bit like the United States

625
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,632
Government is like hey

626
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Listen

627
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Eric

628
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:02,080
You got to get out of that Mariah I know you I know you could stay there for a week until we find you a place closer to

629
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
To the office

630
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,784
We'll see here here is where this this to aspect comes coming

631
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,832
Is this story

632
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
From 2002

633
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
About the threat to remove Embassy

634
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
Employee

635
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:23,328
He's bringing in there saying that they were told to get out of the Marriott

636
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
Be involved with this

637
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
No article cuz it's wrong about the US Embassy

638
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,032
So he brings in another article

639
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Not even Bridge

640
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,152
He just jams them together is if they're the same thing

641
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
Again

642
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
Because Alex up to this point has been relying on this October 2002 article to argue that the embassy was

643
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,360
Threatening to withdraw

644
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
That was true but he was lying about the context of it and pretending it was a recent article related to the Jakarta bomb it right

645
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:20,160
Now he's using me completely different source to make a completely different client while acting like it's the same story

646
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,976
Apparently what happened was that the US Embassy

647
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
She canceled reservations at the Marriott

648
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
Four and a half hours

649
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Before the bombing

650
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
Alex's sole-source on this is a translation of an Indian Indonesian website that makes this claim

651
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,824
And their only source is an alleged employee of the Marriott who is inanna

652
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,408
There's no evidence of this that this is the case

653
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
If I were the embassy in Iraq

654
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
Castrating elaborate

655
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,624
Fake terrorist plots in order to force the Indonesian government of the cracking down on terrorists and going along with my larger Global agenda

656
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
I don't think I would cancel those reservations

657
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
Keep them in just not sure why it doesn't make any sense

658
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Or even better

659
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,192
Some of the Expendable people who worked at the office could show up for the reservations at the embassy to reply even

660
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,776
More pressure on the Indonesian government when was the book

661
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
4

662
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
What's up I mean they said they canceled a booking break

663
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
Didn't say there was an event at the hotel that day

664
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
They could have been a booking for Anytime implication is that it was like

665
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
They were supposed to check in

666
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
Four and a half hours after this or that day or something

667
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,864
And Alex will play with that a little bit later

668
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
It is a little bit like if I'm planning a false flag

669
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm not at Minas you said you don't like I'm going to leave those there

670
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
What are you going to say if we let it go too long there non-refundable okay

671
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
We got

672
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
Are the reservations are supposed to start the next day they have a 24-hour cancellation policy

673
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:05,632
The US Embassy for the United States globalists in Indonesia

674
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
In Spanish

675
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,240
Is there supposed to be there like that that day

676
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Or whatever like

677
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:18,176
A bombing takes a while to plan it didn't come together exactly four hours

678
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,320
Last minute

679
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
So there's literally only once

680
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
Scenario where this makes sense as proof of a can

681
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
Conspiracy

682
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
And that's the world where

683
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
Evil globalist behind this plot

684
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:38,144
Cancel the reservation so they could leave behind a calling card for the conspiracy theorists

685
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Define

686
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,240
This is basically Alex pretending the information is taunting

687
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Which

688
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,592
You have to realize is a part of his the way he

689
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:51,456
Give you the world course it is it is difficult to keep in mind that he

690
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
He does feel as though he

691
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:59,136
He's fighting the Mad Hatter leaving Clues behind at the scene everywhere he goes

692
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,952
The globalist of the Riddler

693
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
Feather using puzzles and

694
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
Exacto

695
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,680
Read all these clothes then I'll find the treasure underneath the United States Constitution it makes perfect sense

696
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
I'm

697
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
You know you and I are pointing out these problems with the idea of them cancelling reservations as being

698
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
Even accepting

699
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,016
The framing that they did in fact cancel these reservations

700
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,600
Which on that day which I do not know to be true

701
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:35,744
Thursday a solid piece of information about that it doesn't work

702
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
If they were there

703
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
They left

704
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Maybe

705
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,168
But even then I don't know

706
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,496
That's what Alex says

707
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
Alex doesn't have another source

708
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
This is just embellishing and making up details about the idea that the embassy

709
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,839
Cancel reservations at the Marriott before the bombing

710
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:17,215
The flimsy article that he's basing this on doesn't say any of this but he can't help himself from escalating

711
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,871
Now they didn't just cancel reservations they're actually there and checked in but they went through all the trouble to check out

712
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
Hours early before the bombing

713
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:32,575
Alex is making this up because if it were true it sure would seem pretty suspicious eyes like view you even real

714
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
That's like

715
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,023
Flimsy ass s*** you know certainly would raise more of an eyebrow then

716
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Then

717
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:48,191
The other details they call in and

718
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,079
Early check-in because we got to we got to the Marriott too soon and they go again okay fine

719
00:42:54,335 --> 00:43:00,479
We got a room available so they go through the whole rigmarole they've left a credit card and an ID they've done all this s***

720
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,295
They go up to the room and then lie all f*** I forgot

721
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,879
We got the Palm today then run down there they have to make a fake

722
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,975
Being there for make a big scene my room wasn't as clean as it nater to me

723
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
Reminder refunded and then they leave

724
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
It's

725
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,911
Conceivably the dumbest

726
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
Track of events

727
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,847
I actually believed happened through this

728
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
Alex can't make compelling arguments based on the information that's available

729
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,343
Upshift that makes his case look stronger he's doing this because he's a liar

730
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,743
Once you establish the idea that you had these Embassy

731
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,767
See people there

732
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
Who checked out

733
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,959
And you add it to believing the Saudi Arabian government about the British

734
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,359
Who are carrying out bombings to destabilize the Saudi Arabian government bright can combine this all together

735
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
And now

736
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,151
You have a hit

737
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
It was at the Marriott

738
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
More more

739
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Victory victory

740
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,751
How do you know that

741
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,807
You can see hero Alex's building out the story

742
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,463
You're the flimsy Source the claims of US Embassy canceled reservations hours before the bombing took place at the Marriott which he is now

743
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,583
Now reporting as the US sending in a team of about 20 people who are pulled out early

744
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,983
This is solely from his own imagination and it's nothing more than him writing his own little story about this tragic event so we can you

745
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Use it to further his own goals

746
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,151
One thing I want to draw special attention to is the part where he says that they were pulled out of the hotel because of threat

747
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,783
This is important because it's a synthesis of this flimsy Source about the cancel hotel reservation

748
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,135
And that article from 2002 about the lead-up to the Bali bomb

749
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,023
Alex is taking the hotel detail from one story and mash it up with the embassy being concerned about threats

750
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
That.

751
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,167
Detail from the other story I meant serving it up for the audience as if it's something meaningful and it's the same thing

752
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:32,287
If anything this is an abusive information and it's kind of silly to pretend that what he's doing is

753
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
Questioning world event

754
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
So the question is just lying about shitzo mass-casualty events can be incorporated into your world do you more easily

755
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
And you can profit off the

756
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
The bright bright

757
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
It is it is funny that I I

758
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,951
Throughout this entire time I find myself trying to

759
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
To give advice to the globalist

760
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:57,887
And then realizing again but what I'm really doing is Justina writers room with Alex trying to punch up his narrative

761
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,007
Is too big

762
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
That's too big it's too obvious

763
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,407
And then I realize I'm not I'm not talking about this I'm with Alex being like okay listen

764
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
What we got to do

765
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:16,319
From the article about the canceled reservations that allege they were 10 to 20 rooms

766
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:22,207
So that's just a number that he's coming up with

767
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
It's all I didn't specify which

768
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
3 days

769
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Either that or he's getting the two more days

770
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,167
But he's just he's just cracking those details into his own form

771
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Whatever shape you want them to take

772
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
In order to make his story makes sense

773
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Now what I think is more interesting

774
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:42,175
With your writerly instinct is the way that you have been one step ahead of Alex's narrative

775
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
What do you like

776
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,063
Hotel

777
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
Well it isn't that is interesting about going back to the past he does have those abilities it does feel like he's busy

778
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,583
There is a little bit of an A to B to C with the wave that the

779
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
The layers of the

780
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,447
Conspiracy are added on as he makes stuff up about like

781
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,775
The little colonel that that is at the edge of the base

782
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
Feels like he's trying

783
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,967
Yeah it's not good but it is an effort which were not used to seeing in the

784
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
Holyshit

785
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
It's transparent

786
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,111
If you take the time to pay attention to it

787
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
But if you don't

788
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
Or if you just operate off headlines

789
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
The Optics of seeing a headline that says

790
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,815
U.s. Embassy

791
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:37,215
Canceled reservation right four and a half hours before bombing accept whatever Alex says

792
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,495
About it like if you just

793
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
Except the story that he tells about that headline chair

794
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,871
The escalation of it does make sense

795
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
Or if you believe

796
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:50,015
The Saudi government about the British Embassy

797
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,575
That they tortured have got 12 skins

798
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
There is a

799
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Conspiracy that is crafted

800
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,487
It's a little bit like a

801
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Good kid improving a book report

802
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
Where you're like okay

803
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
I know you didn't read that book

804
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
But I'm actually kind of respecting your level of creativity in faking that you read that book you're making up some fun s*** shirt

805
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
It's like if a kid

806
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,919
Improvised a book report that was super disrespectful to a bunch of people died in a bomb

807
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Yeah

808
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
That would be gross

809
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,319
Is actually the Civil War

810
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,343
Burial grounds

811
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,647
Yeah that's a really worse book

812
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,511
Sounds doesn't just stay on this topic all all episode he also just

813
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Yells about stuff

814
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Never rest

815
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
So that's a little severe

816
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
Yeah I think

817
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,399
That you could make an interesting argument that in some ways

818
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,679
The police are

819
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
Acting as

820
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,311
But sometimes they do operate as a death squad

821
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,967
I think that's not what Alex is talking about police brutality

822
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:27,807
Kind of the issue little Hollow

823
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,903
I mean if you were putting together an Alex Jones was right clip

824
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
I don't understand why that's not on there

825
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,583
Unless well because Alex it doesn't work in the present for him

826
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
It's not it's not worth while for him to

827
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,007
To really hang his hat on go back to Talladega

828
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Go to Lakeview

829
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
Defend the too many people on the left

830
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
He can't do that no

831
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
Nope he has to literally be above the left-right Paradigm in order

832
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
To do that and he's absolutely not

833
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Yep yep

834
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
In this next clip Alex

835
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Calls

836
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,439
Checked and unfortunately

837
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Question that Alex was not prepared for

838
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
Arp

839
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Military research

840
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
Research

841
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Forgot the p

842
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:40,767
I was really interesting about the first of all that was not a got your question

843
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Know that

844
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,215
The big thing as my mind was it like on the stand

845
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Alex

846
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
This case when Dario was

847
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,311
But

848
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
Testifying

849
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,431
That's her with DARPA stand Sorrentino that is true

850
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,015
That is funny 2003 Alex Wood

851
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
Fumble around with what does DARPA stand for

852
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Yeah that's

853
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
We're if that way if that was script

854
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
See what I've heard that Ding real fast

855
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
I understand

856
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Twisted Fork

857
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Advance

858
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,863
I understand if you would have trouble with like harp

859
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
That much

860
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
I don't know what her,

861
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
And he's in the middle of

862
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Like this

863
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:31,199
It's been awhile since we've done 2003 episode that whole thing about how they were trying to gamble on terrorist

864
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,479
Attacks and stuff

865
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
Set up a stock market on deaths

866
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
It's B

867
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,903
Pretty front and center of his narrative

868
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,303
You should not be talk conspiracy theorist you should have DARPA on the reading

869
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,143
Math teacher you have to be able to do long division in your head like you have

870
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,215
You can't stumble around with that s*** otherwise going respect

871
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Call

872
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
And this is the level of discourse

873
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
What's going on on the show man eats

874
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
Heady stuff

875
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
I want schedule

876
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Minion on a cup

877
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Sweden

878
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Bad

879
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
On August 27th

880
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Marczyk

881
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Going to be

882
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Closest

883
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
60000

884
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
We know

885
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
Globaltranz

886
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
We do know that

887
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Valve

888
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Believe in

889
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Carter

890
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
Bush Clinton

891
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
Exactly

892
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Very

893
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
And you think that they would

894
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Celebrate

895
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,999
That date with another

896
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Attack and

897
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Is that

898
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Reading about it

899
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
Here

900
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
We've been worried about

901
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
When is

902
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:42,527
That is amazing

903
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,063
But I mean

904
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,415
Look that's amazing

905
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,815
Not knowing a thing to suddenly just being like this thing is Central's real worried about it

906
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
Verify this is that true the numbers a man that there's a preponderance of evidence that

907
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:06,591
Mars is going to be still playlist Mars is the God of War

908
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
It happens

909
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,159
Right I just appreciate that instantaneous

910
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,999
Absolutely

911
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,839
Absolutely you bet brother you've just fill in the blank

912
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,423
If there is something you're asking if Alex if you should be worried about it

913
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,031
Absolutely brother is a reason to be operate

914
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:41,919
You are not crazy for having this fear of something that nobody is literally ever thought before

915
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
You are right my friend let's kill minute

916
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,623
It's a valuable time on my show talking about being worried about Mars being too close

917
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,927
I don't know boys celebrating

918
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,255
Mars being close

919
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:01,375
How to build a problem here you didn't explain how this is related to an occult

920
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Situation

921
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:08,287
Oh I bet because Mars is Mars is close this time they can be like this important

922
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
I'm hearing the words you're saying

923
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,711
But you sound dumb it makes so much sense

924
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
Really really

925
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
Umart you reveal yourself to be a mark what do you ask questions like that if she just it's just

926
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,743
Understood that the globalists

927
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
Bomb things

928
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,863
When planets are close

929
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
How much closer

930
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:41,823
I felt like a million miles closer on this one day

931
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
I think it was quite a bit closer

932
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
What's closer

933
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,503
I don't know I don't remember I looked it up but I don't remember the exact

934
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,855
Right right I did look up if there was any bombing on

935
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,927
Little League World Series

936
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:03,839
Maybe somebody videos

937
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:09,983
Cabela's right over the the Raptors but some

938
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,847
Yeah this is just dumb

939
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
It's interesting

940
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:22,015
That you have that response of like why do you even would that even be something at the globalists

941
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,087
Arranged it this to me I mean I'm joking around

942
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,903
Scolding you or like making fun of you would like to me it is like

943
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
McDonald's app

944
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
Shuffle little bit closer

945
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Yeah

946
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,559
Banana Breeze

947
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,959
There's magical powers that come from

948
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Blue Xbox further away

949
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,567
Something else changes that makes you

950
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
Let's likely to celebrate

951
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,663
Write it being further away than

952
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
Venus gets closer

953
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Is it just a day

954
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:58,623
Is it just like all this is It's like a solar eclipse they all go outside they look up and then I got like that

955
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
And then they go back to their lives

956
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,463
Solar eclipse

957
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,583
You got it that's right

958
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
It is

959
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
So much

960
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:16,031
Your caveman just like anything is a side just like all there's a shoot except that's a side

961
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,079
Decide

962
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,151
Such that it is just caveman thought

963
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,479
Alex takes like

964
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
The date

965
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,879
Kind of simplistic understanding of symbolism occultism

966
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
Supplies it sort of

967
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Universally

968
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
Seems like it could be

969
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:38,815
Like

970
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:43,423
An equinox or somebody's got bombs

971
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
Anytime there's a like

972
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
A date that has like

973
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
Every Lego it's doubles

974
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:56,735
March 6th 2009 369

975
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
The magical powers on this date

976
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,903
I like B one thing that's never really addressed is

977
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,719
How many holidays occult people have

978
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
To have

979
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,839
Every day there is a holiday there's something

980
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,935
We should all live like that

981
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,495
Everyday is special and we're celebrating

982
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:22,591
Everyday but not everyday Mars is the closest it's going to be in 60,000 years

983
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
Now that's true it heavy

984
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
59900

985
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,783
And something years before we get that again

986
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:31,551
Someday

987
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:37,951
And look at it cuz there will be a thousand years so

988
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,999
So Alex

989
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:45,119
We know that his dad was a big baby ask I have planned a bad influence on him

990
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,655
Uncle wasn't better

991
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
5 years ago

992
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:28,383
I like that image goblin teeth

993
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
Demon face

994
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
Dehumanizing

995
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:39,135
A responsive that is interested I would like to

996
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
To know what that is like is a gentleman I regret to inform you we are in this dating thing

997
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,071
Fall into the dehumanizing

998
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,167
What is dehumanizing specifically inside the

999
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
I don't I don't know

1000
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,359
I'm trying to visualize this

1001
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
I appreciate first

1002
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:08,575
My favorite visual is lifting up the curtain to reveal a pet that's just great that's good show with chip

1003
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,391
Okay if you reveal if you open a curtain to a pit

1004
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
It's good stuff

1005
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Yeah alright

1006
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,511
It could be anything man

1007
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:20,863
I mean it would have to be is it is it there's got to be more than one Satan in the pit

1008
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,679
First off they need to be multiple Satan's in this

1009
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
That possible

1010
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:31,615
I assume he can split himself up he's got classic Marvel Powers these days

1011
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Sorry right

1012
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
That's not my son

1013
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,879
This is like the argument that Alex in his uncle had yeah probably

1014
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,927
I think that's the cousin Buckley's dad

1015
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:50,047
My guess is he has brought up before

1016
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,375
Lyra talks about uncle's with the information

1017
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
So

1018
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Fun

1019
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,263
There's nothing new story that Alex touches on here

1020
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151
President Bush

1021
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
Real real nice

1022
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:53,023
And all the things where people talk about how accurate Alex's they seem to just forget his

1023
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,887
Constant obsession with how a universal draft was right around the corner and other Global estate

1024
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,191
Set up for the next time there was a terrorist attack

1025
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:00,959
That was a

1026
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,007
And all your sons and daughters were going to be

1027
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
Conscripted

1028
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
Big white van that

1029
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,383
And he was pretty tore up all the time

1030
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:15,295
One wonders if Alex made a big stink when Trump nominated Donald Benton to this position in April 2017

1031
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
That was evident

1032
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,111
Trump trying to reinstate the draft

1033
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
I would imagine it wasn't

1034
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
I don't think you probably even notice

1035
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:26,559
This is a small government office that has existed since World War 1

1036
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Probably the

1037
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
Just be abolished

1038
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
Even though it's not a pool for a draft

1039
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
The names and information gathered from Selective Service registration are used by The Joint advertising marketing research

1040
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,591
Studies program out

1041
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,615
Department of Defense

1042
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,967
Which uses that information to recruit volunteers into the armed services

1043
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,271
Anyway

1044
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,575
It's up it's not cool

1045
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,879
Right right there isn't a draft

1046
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,719
And there wasn't wanted 2003

1047
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,535
Get rid of that that's that's bad

1048
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
I mean

1049
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,703
It's obvious there won't be a dress we can barely afford the military we have now can you imagine if we just had an

1050
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
An influx of

1051
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,031
I don't know 10 million people

1052
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:14,687
Just to walk in there how much would it cost to outfit them do we got to spend a trillion dollars on one plane

1053
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,991
Kind of understand the thing

1054
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
Or something like that

1055
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
In

1056
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,599
Past days

1057
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Although I

1058
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,927
I think that there is a social contract

1059
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,023
Is coming to place that is we will never have a draft again

1060
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
Ever

1061
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
Is not something that

1062
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Is going

1063
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
BECU in as appropriate

1064
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
On any level

1065
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
And

1066
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Because of that

1067
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,287
I think it'll be a show of good faith

1068
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
I might just get rid of this office because there's this premise of it is like in case we need

1069
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,735
Write this registration break glass

1070
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:55,903
Get rid of that because you're not going to need it cuz we're not doing the draft again I mean you know

1071
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,463
It is it is always a a pretty

1072
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:05,119
Universal step towards fascism whenever you have a standing army it at the call you know

1073
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:11,519
What part of it's that idea of a rapid medical Army

1074
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:15,359
Part of that hypothetical draft is you're not really supposed to have an army

1075
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,639
That's ghetto

1076
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:22,783
So everybody has their own skin in the game so to speak and now it is kind of an impunity

1077
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:29,695
And that's kind of part of our agreement you know we don't have a draft and then we'll look the other way whenever you start warzone

1078
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
All the time

1079
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,303
We can go and get rid of that part of it too

1080
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,839
Give me the most of these office

1081
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
So

1082
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Look

1083
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,471
Alexandra present-day talk a lot about being broke

1084
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
And being in debt

1085
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
And

1086
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
You know he needs money

1087
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
I

1088
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Who found the

1089
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Time

1090
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Ever said that

1091
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Okay

1092
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,015
Honor the very first time well I mean if you believe

1093
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
What he's about to say

1094
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
I'm about

1095
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
Very important

1096
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
People in Japan

1097
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
You know Alex baby

1098
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
I'm not going to

1099
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Infomercial

1100
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Wow

1101
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
Yeah that's kind of a bummer

1102
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
That to here

1103
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
Someone else say back to him

1104
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,671
In the past

1105
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,767
Bad news Jim yeah yeah gym

1106
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
The show

1107
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Deteriorate

1108
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
Largely

1109
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,911
Hey marketing infomercial

1110
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,495
Water filters

1111
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,079
Introduction of an infomercial

1112
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,359
With this

1113
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,199
Hey I'm behind on my shortwave bill

1114
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,271
Right cuz we pay for airtime

1115
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
On the shortwave State share and my water filter guy helps pay that bill so here he is by his

1116
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,207
Is water filter

1117
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,023
Very difficult to square someone saying

1118
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
You know what

1119
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:19,423
I like that you don't do infomercials and you've got the Integrity to not turn your show into

1120
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,031
Anyways my water filters

1121
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:30,431
I agree with you bear mentioning that it is not as intrusive at this

1122
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:36,063
Not the whole show they're doing

1123
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,135
Pretty transparent

1124
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,535
This guy selling his sales pitch for his water filter

1125
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
Fluoride

1126
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:51,679
And so like there is still like content is being used as marketing

1127
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:56,031
So still that look blurry distinction but it is

1128
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
A far cry from the

1129
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
Deterioration into infomercial City

1130
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,455
I am leaving behind the information

1131
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Yeah that Alex

1132
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,879
Becomes later it isn't like I appreciate most of all that 15,000

1133
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Dollar number

1134
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
You know

1135
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:18,815
That I feel like now

1136
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:25,215
He's got shell companies he's got to have accountants will

1137
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,799
Going to lie for him and then he's got to have accountants that his account

1138
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:33,151
Why do in order to launder their lies right

1139
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:39,551
Bullshittin a legal situation

1140
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:45,951
Barnes all you've got to do is pay your shortwave bill you stay there stay there

1141
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,767
A good sweet spot yeah absolutely

1142
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,119
Poor Alex

1143
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,935
There's a lot of folks who

1144
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
Dinner

1145
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,799
What are the things that they say I think you would agree with that is

1146
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,335
That he tells it like

1147
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
Like it is

1148
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Order

1149
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Tell him like it is

1150
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
Telling it

1151
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Like it

1152
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,079
Is no one who has

1153
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,639
No one who says I tell it like it is

1154
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
Ever actually

1155
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
One does

1156
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,991
R2 has anything good

1157
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:45,599
D'usse people who calls them like they see them

1158
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,183
As long as you add the plural

1159
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,231
Cousin like I sees them that's that's good stuff

1160
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,095
Okay so that's a little bit straight shooter

1161
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
Straight shooter

1162
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:03,519
No no no other people describe you as that makes me think that you are a liar

1163
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
Silex takes more call

1164
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,175
Here and he gets a call from a guy who I believe in laws

1165
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,087
I appreciate this man it's kind of difficult to tell exactly where he's coming from but he believes

1166
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
I think

1167
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,719
Maybe in a Godzilla kind of situation it got that

1168
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
It's self-evident law

1169
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
Yeah natural law perhaps to specific enough for me to really nail down but he does believe that just because

1170
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,751
Laws are signed into law that doesn't mean their laws

1171
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,567
He's not in the jurisdiction

1172
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
Score of the law of the Jungle kind of guy

1173
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
I think

1174
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
Based on his voice

1175
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:49,087
I don't think Elias demijohns probably true but maybe spiritual in anyway

1176
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
Here's a request

1177
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Alex

1178
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,183
Run all over you

1179
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,559
Just want to know if I can

1180
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Time to call you

1181
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
2 minutes

1182
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
What

1183
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
Working

1184
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Good excuse

1185
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
Phone call

1186
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:35,167
Like dude I'm behind the 8-ball

1187
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,567
I like it when trying to let him down easy getaway out of had big trouble

1188
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,943
Listen I'm on the run from the cops right now I can't be taking phone calls

1189
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:53,343
Doing the radio show honestly I had to get rid of my phone I've got burner phones

1190
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:59,743
I throw them into the ocean after I use them one time in a bunker that is sealed with lead and

1191
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
They'll never find me

1192
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,095
I'm by the 8-ball

1193
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,143
I'm working for the next 6 hours

1194
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,935
I'm being chased by the cops

1195
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,519
I've got to take my daughter fishing at some point

1196
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,079
So I can't call you it's really obvious

1197
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:19,967
The way you could just handle this it is unsafe for me to talk to you off the air

1198
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:24,063
I don't know what you're up to there's a lot of ways that this could have

1199
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
Expose me

1200
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
It's just

1201
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,927
If you're Alex is the simplest thing in the world

1202
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,743
But you don't want to give that message

1203
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
Because it's

1204
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:37,631
Too likely to make the audience think that you think that they're crazy

1205
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Or something

1206
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
Where is

1207
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,239
Public figure

1208
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,775
There is a very

1209
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,847
Acceptable boundary to be like I'm not talking

1210
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
Sing to you on my like

1211
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,199
Affair with each other

1212
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,015
Email or something

1213
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,831
But it's not we're not going to do that

1214
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:01,695
When you Court when you actively Court people who blur the line between reality and fiction

1215
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:05,023
It's going to be a little bit more of a tighter walk

1216
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
To let him down easy

1217
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
On account of you don't know what part of the fiction that's going to

1218
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
Add you into that's true that through a lot of interactions and Alex has a

1219
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
This man's over the course of

1220
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,895
There is an unwillingness to

1221
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:27,295
Be honest about what the boundary is because of that

1222
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,855
And we just need to keep this separate

1223
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:36,255
The only thing I know about you is you believe what I say

1224
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:43,935
It's you do the Groucho Marx thing I don't to be a member of any club that would have me as a number

1225
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,983
No self-esteem but with Alex

1226
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,615
Completely different I made this club and I don't ever want to visit this club

1227
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Close I lock the door with them inside it want to be around anybody who would be a member of my

1228
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,367
All the double deuce and I'm not step

1229
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
Open foot and not f****** place

1230
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Something like this color

1231
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:09,023
Here's what he wants to discuss with Alex off of hair

1232
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Well

1233
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,911
Interpretation

1234
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
The Bible

1235
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Oh boy

1236
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
It's a long story

1237
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Doughboy

1238
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
Alright order

1239
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
Well

1240
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Pervert

1241
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
Description

1242
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Some places

1243
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Bill Reese

1244
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Figure out what

1245
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
If not

1246
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,311
Perverted word

1247
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Yeah I think

1248
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,199
Open hour

1249
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
Probably probably longer than

1250
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,855
Sir sir you have just explained

1251
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,159
Why I do not want to talk to you

1252
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:14,303
People have been studying the Bible for quite a while now

1253
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,607
You didn't you have cracked the code

1254
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,167
Get there you're telling me

1255
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,287
And it'll take you half an hour to explain it

1256
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,687
It's out I'm sure you're going to stop in a half hour I'm going to start the watch you don't get on with things

1257
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:38,111
31 last year and I know that another thing that was making the rounds on social media was

1258
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
Recently was a clip

1259
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,207
Of Alex saying there was going to be

1260
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
False flag globalist terror attacks

1261
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,071
You know before the midterm

1262
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:52,191
Call Ron filipkowski

1263
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,287
But Alex says that all the f****** time. Everyday

1264
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,615
It is not worthwhile or meaningful

1265
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
To post at all

1266
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,175
To make people think this is like

1267
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
I'll look at him

1268
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,991
Look at him he's making a

1269
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:09,087
Desperate weird prediction know this is what he does every day

1270
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
Since 2003

1271
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
Records without a cord

1272
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Kent State

1273
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Is recording a special Authority

1274
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
Today's New York Daily News

1275
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:35,711
If you want you can get

1276
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Get the Daily News

1277
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
Boom boom

1278
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,743
I mean let's say we've had explosions before the midterm we've had nukes

1279
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
Before

1280
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,815
Presidential election

1281
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:57,215
We've had there were going dark before

1282
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
Haitian me up

1283
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,335
I mean they were obviously the polonium poisoning was rampant for a while

1284
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
There were two incidents now

1285
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
The same person

1286
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:09,247
Also didn't happen right yes there was

1287
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,551
Yeah

1288
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,343
Constant

1289
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,623
Can feature of his career

1290
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,927
Anybody who

1291
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:20,511
Doesn't understand that it's window dressing

1292
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
It's again just like we were

1293
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,959
Laughing and joking about this before it just like if you ask Alex is there a reason to be scared about something

1294
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,751
One of the things

1295
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,823
Always uses to scare people is that

1296
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
Specter of

1297
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,175
The coming false flag attack

1298
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223
That is justified by some

1299
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
Piece of his

1300
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,527
His narrative

1301
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
There is

1302
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
Obviously

1303
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,975
Democrats are scared that they're going to lose the midterms and so they must do bombings in order to make sure they

1304
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
Win the midterm

1305
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,279
Sprite

1306
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:58,911
Ashcroft wants to get Patriot Act in but there's opposition to it from the Patriots

1307
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,215
He's better do some boom boom

1308
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
In order to

1309
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:04,031
Make sure that this goes through

1310
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,127
Always it's always this and I don't understand how it's been

1311
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,151
20 years

1312
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:14,783
I know it's yours and it's still an effective thing it's still something that people can

1313
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,367
It's because people dip in and out

1314
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,951
It's because people like Ron filipowski get to dip in and out

1315
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,999
A f****** youth baseball coach

1316
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:28,863
I turned by the media into some f****** alt-right hero

1317
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,167
Just being a f****** idiot

1318
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,447
I hate him so much

1319
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
But

1320
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:37,055
I mean it is it is that like if you dip it in

1321
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
Every 3 or 4 months

1322
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,967
That you have in your head this idea well he can't do this everyday

1323
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,759
Because you assume that

1324
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:52,159
Because there's no way he could do this every day even if you have an awareness of who Alex is and you don't

1325
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
Pay much attention

1326
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,231
Bronson even was like

1327
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:01,631
Does he repeated exhaust is a awareness of what

1328
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,423
By watching a bunch of it

1329
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,959
And unfortunately I don't

1330
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
I think that most people should do that cuz

1331
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:12,383
Well I mean the problem is our own assumptions based on how everything else work

1332
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,431
It is to us

1333
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,831
Unsustainable to do the same thing everyday will you imagine that you watched

1334
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:26,719
Clip every few months and you go wow this must be an unusual thing it wouldn't

1335
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,279
Newsworthy

1336
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,607
He's on one it wouldn't be newsworthy if it's everyday

1337
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,655
It's newsworthy because it's manufactured

1338
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
For you

1339
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
It created for you I think there's that

1340
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,543
The dipping in and out for sure is a is a

1341
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,383
Piece of it

1342
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
You know there is just

1343
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
Hanging in the world

1344
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,503
Like negative

1345
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
Traumatic events

1346
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Do happen

1347
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
Jo-Ann's

1348
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,927
Those are things that Alex will then attach these ideas to

1349
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,207
And that people

1350
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,487
I guess people will just

1351
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:02,303
Experience that as being the confirmation

1352
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,351
And they'll forget about all the

1353
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,143
Countless times that he's been

1354
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Making up

1355
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
Vague

1356
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,007
Warnings about boom boom

1357
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
I mean that the thing that's most

1358
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,080
Suspicious is I like

1359
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:18,176
In 20 years the globalist would have to have taken a break for a

1360
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,248
No way I've never stopped

1361
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,784
Not once there's no

1362
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,880
Despite the fact that they celebrate a million holidays every year

1363
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:32,000
It is always a work holiday they never even take a vacation like Alex that way

1364
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:36,096
Read that he's not working ever know

1365
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,680
Just gave me an idea for a movie Pitch

1366
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,800
Globalist vacationing finally take no no no

1367
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,104
Mario 2 movie pictures

1368
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
The globalist

1369
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,736
Are on vacation

1370
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,528
But they're still need to be false flag

1371
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,368
Naturally they bring in the junior varsity globalist

1372
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
Right

1373
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:07,072
Somebody gets somebody gets promoted this is their big shot right but it turns out the eager young person this is

1374
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:12,448
This is a if they were younger or movie like 15 years ago

1375
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:18,848
To be a Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson vehicle are the guys who come in and they

1376
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:25,504
Have you paid the screw everything up but at the end they come together and really the cab old school

1377
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
The closest Maaco

1378
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:38,816
I got to call him something like the the the nation Squad

1379
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,608
You know they're not Global na

1380
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
That sucks

1381
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
Back for you in about

1382
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
Six months to get a treatment going

1383
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:55,968
So I'm glad to have gone back to the past because at least there is something

1384
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,016
Concrete going on to be.

1385
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
That is

1386
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
Refresher appreciate the path

1387
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,160
A great deal

1388
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:08,768
And so I will check back in on the present-day keep people posted on

1389
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:12,608
I'm bulshit outages up to as the

1390
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,448
Terror of the mid-term approaches midterms

1391
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
But until then Jordans

1392
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
We doing website.com

1393
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,128
We're also on Twitter

1394
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,736
But until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark

1395
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,016
Gerald Smith

1396
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,600
No savage

1397
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:40,000
I was wondering where Gerald Wilfred cousin

1398
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
The Gribble Pitbull

1399
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,888
Holding

1400
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:51,008
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
