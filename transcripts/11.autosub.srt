00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,104
This is a show where I watched way too much Infowars

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
Particular

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,480
Sit down with my friend Jordan who has no goddamn clue what he's talkin to

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
About Jordan how are things

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
They're doing good

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,928
And I would say we're going to be going over the February 10th

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
Episode of The Alex Jones that was last Friday as this comes out

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
There's a couple

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,168
Little bit of business to take care of

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
First of all

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
Got a big old shout out

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
To randomly Susanna

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
Which is

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
Knowledge fight. Tumblr.com

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
It was regarding the David Knight app

21
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
I would like to make a big apology

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,896
I know I know plenty of you voiced your support

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
I didn't hear from at least three people

24
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,808
That was both of you

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
Hersevoort and we agree with you

26
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
Yeah

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Listen to boring man we get it

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
So boring but we're back

29
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
In the greener pastures of the real

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Rate

31
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
Hundred proof

32
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Alex

33
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Joan

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
Territory the Everclear of Alex.

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,520
What I like to do is I like to sit down

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Try and figure out

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
I would like to sometimes

38
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
Figure out what the the plot

39
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,624
All the shows

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Is mine

41
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Sort of

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Believed into every aspect of the narrative

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
Is this

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
I really struggled with what it was

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
I can't really find a synthesis

46
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Like

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
And now I actually regret that I brought up the idea that there is no guitar

48
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,040
Gator Tire prep

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
You can say

50
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,672
Yes and no half the time right there's a 50-50 proposition

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
I was just

52
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
I'm trying to figure out a way to articulate this

53
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
And I want you to let it play

54
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Dulux just listen to it

55
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Because if

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
He plays it

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
3 *

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
Call wait what he plays with clip

59
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
Three times back to back to back

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Week you played it a whole bunch

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Okay and

62
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
Just insanity

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Love this clip

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
A movie

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
It's just

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
It's propaganda

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
It's Russell Westbrook dunking on a guy right

68
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
The first one is about a f****** stupid Democrats are and explain why

69
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Eclipse so much

70
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,856
Hello this is how we open the she has the 54321 silent movie era

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
It took just to let you know this is how that f****** entire show up

72
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
No

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
This clip is how we opens Friday

74
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
So just cold open

75
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Gotcha

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
Ireland

77
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,360
But at its widest

78
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,224
Level is with 12 mi from Shore to Shore

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
Canada's smallest level of smallest star

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Location at 7 MI

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
Between assure and the other

82
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,751
That correct I don't have the exact dimensions but that's your point so I can

83
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
Guam is a small island island

84
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:57,727
I can work with President Bush

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
What are we going to do

86
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
How can a president

87
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Who is acting in the manner that he's acting whether he's talking about the travel ban

88
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin and knowing that they have

89
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,911
DNC

90
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
And knowing that

91
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
He's responsible for supplying

92
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
The bones of the innocent children and families and

93
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
What is Aleppo

94
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
You are correct

95
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
He is

96
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Wrapping his arms around pooping continuant

97
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,799
Into

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.

99
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,671
So hilarious

100
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,791
So I had fun with that

101
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
To think I was enjoying every moment of that

102
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,239
How does a video of trump xylophone

103
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
I don't know what the context of that clip is but I know the context of the other

104
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,759
A person

105
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Set the clip of I don't know who the senator is we talked about Guam but he wasn't literally talking about it

106
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
It was metaphor

107
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
It was his creative license

108
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
Somewhat

109
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
Furthermore that is hilarious

110
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
American history

111
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
It is not that far out of what we're used to

112
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
No I mean even the in Quincy Adams. The Earth

113
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,319
Makalo believes that a lot of people of hell

114
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Republicans don't believe climate change

115
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Israel

116
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,975
Also crazy than Guam tipping over

117
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
And think that

118
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
Is Nancy Pelosi accidentally saying

119
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
Bush when she met

120
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Right

121
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
But then the other ones

122
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
Talk about her bush

123
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
One Senator saying or a representative

124
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
The freestyle

125
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Obviously

126
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
That is metaphorical

127
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Obviously there's

128
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
A reason that you saying that she's not literally saying she was at

129
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Then Maxine Waters

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,927
Forgetting Aleppo for a second

131
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,839
I meant saying that Putin is invading Korea

132
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Crimea

133
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
Whatever

134
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
Graphic novel

135
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
Crimea

136
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
It's it's these

137
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
It slips of the tongue

138
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Is f****** latched onto

139
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
And made this two-and-a-half minute clip

140
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
Are you just plays it Non-Stop

141
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:34,559
Yeah you plays it we're going to talk about this on the next episode he plays it during a Jon rappoport special

142
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Fantastic illuminate

143
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
I don't really disagree

144
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
Maxine Waters is a little bad I don't disagree at all

145
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
She's a little old for facts in order baby

146
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
It's time for also she's out of town and part of a democratic establishment that is clearly f*****

147
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Everything up

148
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
The Putin is invading Korea

149
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Or she actually doesn't know Aleppo

150
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Is insane

151
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Yeah especially the first one

152
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,263
The only person who doesn't know Aleppo is Gary Johnson

153
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Your shots of him during

154
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Picture-in-picture

155
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
So there's like the two shots next it's the video playing

156
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
And then Alex sitting at the desk

157
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Alex Jones

158
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,719
Is making real quizzical husband

159
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
Refractive power

160
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
Acting reel

161
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
The show and how he

162
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
Again he plays the two more times throughout the course of

163
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
But he doesn't

164
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Being in love with

165
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Okay

166
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
Proud of it they put together a clip it got little backing music behind it they added it I'm sure they added it pretty

167
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Pretty well right

168
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,839
Good on him.

169
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
They made a good clip for the Kim

170
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Propaganda

171
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
So

172
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
Good way to start your show dickhole

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
He gets down to

174
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Substance

175
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Next web

176
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
And this next clip is what I would call

177
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
The first one

178
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,367
80 + percent of the time but the night before the show

179
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
I'm going to send

180
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
Circuit Judge I believe is what I used

181
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,679
Are asses for a second

182
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Who is

183
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
What he said there was actually literally the first lie but he's a bigger Lies coming up

184
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
The 80s

185
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Plus percent of a time there

186
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Decisions are overturned

187
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,879
To trap a 9% Orchard

188
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
Not the most overturned

189
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Court in Atlanta

190
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Circuit Court decision

191
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Overturn

192
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Is it is it

193
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
The first

194
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
The middle

195
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Admittedly

196
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
The problem with all of our courts

197
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Is that

198
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
The ideal court system is

199
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Is empath

200
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Dispassionate

201
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
Observers of the code of robots

202
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
Instead what we have is

203
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Weird-ass

204
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Random

205
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Ideological bent from our courts

206
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,167
Sure we have a super M court that isn't even really like

207
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
The game at this point

208
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,823
Maneuvering pieces around

209
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
Are we okay with the Supreme Court the way it is right now

210
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
The only reason

211
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
It's not even before the election

212
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
You had people like Ted Cruz

213
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Arabic interpreter like

214
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,047
Never if Hillary gets in will just never vote for 1

215
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Eventually

216
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Get rid of

217
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Supreme Court

218
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
It was fine whatever peep

219
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Who disagreed with you or

220
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Empower

221
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
But now that you're empowered you don't want that s***

222
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
Let me stop you

223
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Trumpsc

224
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Utter bafflement

225
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
By the fact

226
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
GameStop

227
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
We'll see you in court

228
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
He's not angry about it

229
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Confuse

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
And in raid

231
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
He didn't understand that that was possible you didn't get weight

232
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
I signed an executive order that means

233
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,823
La forever right I'm supposed to be king right I'm running this like a business

234
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
You don't even use to watch

235
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Like real talk

236
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,783
And a reality show cartoons

237
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Cuz he didn't watch yet Finding Dory that is

238
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
Screenings at the White House okay

239
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Really recommend

240
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Watch The Emperor's New Groove

241
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
A great moving Patrick Warburton

242
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Engraved price

243
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
You know how being a dictator

244
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
Is not really cool and put learning about

245
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Also suggest

246
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
He watches

247
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
Schoolhouse Rock

248
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Yeah

249
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Schoolhouse Rock Let's go with magic

250
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
School bus that's really important

251
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Pretty sure he doesn't know how the human body works

252
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Absolutely

253
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
Movie

254
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
How dare you

255
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,999
Circuit Court

256
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
And get the actual lie

257
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
80% is

258
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
White exaggeration

259
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
Well-rounded up slightly

260
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
That's not uncommon

261
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Appellate court

262
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Isn't that weird

263
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Kind of

264
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Settings

265
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
Is that the fact that I just found out that I am reason is a lot of time

266
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Supreme Court

267
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
Implicitly agrees with the ruling they were

268
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Just reject

269
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Kate

270
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
So the only reason that the Supreme Court would take a

271
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Case is if there was a significant possibility

272
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
That it would be over

273
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
Okay yes they don't take most

274
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,735
Cases of course the reason that you would go to the 9th circuit

275
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,575
Court is because it is like the reason that washed

276
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
10 would go directly to

277
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
2 back court is because it is a left

278
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Court

279
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,535
Maybe it has a loose sure about that

280
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
Appointed by

281
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
The G.

282
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
I'm not sure because I'm not sure how it works

283
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,751
In terms of standing and what goes to what court

284
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Is just enough knowledge

285
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Tell people the wrong

286
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,503
Words and then I'll put them in the wrong order and people who believe lies

287
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
I will tell you this

288
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
It doesn't matter

289
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,159
Choose the case at hand

290
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,559
We always get bugged-out reality whatever that has no bearing on what we're about the limits into the real life

291
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,215
80 + 11

292
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Remind me of something

293
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
American flag is offensive

294
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
Clothing.

295
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,439
How dare they provide Public Works

296
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,767
Satanism

297
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Coca-Cola shirts in Warwood

298
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Raza Metro Mexican flag

299
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,703
But you cannot wear the American flag

300
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
I am going to guess

301
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Before you say a word until you ever looked up this particular

302
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
Stan's did formation relevant to it

303
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
I did perhaps

304
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
It contradicts what it is

305
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Feather Alex Jones was sad

306
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
Yeah your bingo is really the night circuit court

307
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Rule

308
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
In agreement

309
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
With a lawsuit that was

310
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Presented about people wearing

311
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
What ended up happening was they ruled

312
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
Couldn't wear the American

313
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,527
Sandy Spring Court refused to hear the case because there was like now this is this is fine

314
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,647
Case was was about people

315
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Student

316
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Can flag

317
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
On Cinco de Mayo

318
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Okay here's why

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,239
Alright that seems automatically a little bit of like a hey we're reacting

320
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
To your thing

321
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
The controversy goes back to May 2009 an incident

322
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Between

323
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
High School

324
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Edit school-sponsored

325
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
Cinco de Mayo is that a Mexican American

326
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Student walked around campus

327
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
The flag of Mexico

328
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Will a makeshift American

329
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
States flag

330
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
The flag Berry students

331
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Dunes on both sides complained about the in

332
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
A year later several students came

333
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
School on Cinco de Mayo wearing American

334
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Flag shirts

335
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
School officials told the students

336
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Remove the American flag shirt

337
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Or turn the shirts inside out

338
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,079
The educator said the American flag shirts could send a message

339
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Cinco de Mayo celebration

340
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
And I had Public Safety

341
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
So

342
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
What ended up happening was there was

343
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Essentially

344
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,695
Between Cinco de Mayo celebrates aggressively

345
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
American

346
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Flag apparel

347
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,351
Them on Cinco de Mayo people just to have nice stuff

348
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,751
Why can't you just work one day

349
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,335
Like look

350
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
I get it

351
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
You're a white nationalist motherfuker

352
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
In high school

353
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Which

354
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
You're probably going to grow out of it

355
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Hopefully

356
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
It's time to pray

357
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
Hopefully you'll grow up

358
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
But

359
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
Even if you're a white nationalist

360
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
Just be like

361
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
360

362
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
4 days of the year

363
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
But I'm going to give you this

364
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
The problem with that philosophy though is that

365
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Cuz it is even

366
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Moron for them

367
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,991
It's like I have to I have to be even more American on this day

368
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Against your

369
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
Presumably anti-American

370
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,951
African flag have people I don't know

371
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,255
That's insane

372
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
The court rules essentially that

373
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
The school was allowed to say

374
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
No American flag apparel on Cinco de Mayo

375
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
BWB had nothing to do with the actual American flag apparel and everything to do with whether or not the school is allowed

376
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,455
How to say the reason was for the

377
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
Protection of

378
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
Both

379
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
V

380
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
Cinco de Mayo celebrating students

381
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
And

382
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,367
The kids wearing the America

383
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
In Flagstaff

384
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
Right because it was it was a situation where they deem

385
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
Like okay

386
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
There were fights that broke out

387
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Conflict

388
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,143
Let's just not allow people to

389
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
Have this fight

390
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
You're at school

391
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,591
Not as far as as far as the conversation over and this is this is exactly what

392
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
The

393
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
The Muslim ban thing

394
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Happened there

395
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:39,807
The reason that they issued that stay on whether or not they could reinstate it immediately

396
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,391
Is not because they agree or disagree

397
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
With what was going on

398
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,511
It is not because they say there's a u

399
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
You can't do this or that

400
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
It's because he

401
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
He did it wrong

402
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
It's because the executive order was written in such a way

403
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,727
That it impossible to

404
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Any other way

405
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
As a religious

406
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
Scituate

407
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
Sure

408
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
Much more like if he'd taken

409
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Get his f****** time on it

410
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,039
Like Mike by my constant thought about about Trump

411
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,111
Is whether or not you agree with what he's trying

412
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
How to do

413
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Bad at

414
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,768
Doing the follow-through if Obama was in

415
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Obama if he was going to instigate a Muslim

416
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Right

417
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,424
Do that because he's at Sacramento

418
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
He would spend months on it he would have his lawyers go through word-by-word

419
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
The court system

420
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,736
Cuz I don't want to waste everybody's time and money

421
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
I'm sending it through the court system in Spanish

422
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
All of this time going

423
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,904
Yes you can no you can't pull really hard

424
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Galvanize the opposition

425
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
He would try really hard to actually make it work

426
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,536
Competency

427
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,424
No issue with that it seems like they wrote like hey no Muslims on a page

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,008
Genistein

429
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Meme it might as well have been that

430
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah the other thing in that ruling was that nonsense

431
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Right which is very important

432
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,600
We all believed already

433
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Hi tie quilt

434
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
But the root of that is

435
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
Most of us believe people

436
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
People

437
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,656
Ya goddamn Independence

438
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Doesn't say we believe you know

439
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Folks

440
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
We Believe American citizens

441
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Our Creator net worth

442
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Call me eyes of God

443
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Not women

444
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
That is the problem

445
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Very clearly

446
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
We stipulate that rights aren't given by the

447
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
The government's are given by our creator

448
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:59,072
Whatever you want problems with but whatever greater if you understand that that's why I

449
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,680
Which again that's kind of the whole point of America is that we can't have a state religion

450
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,496
But human beings have right because of just

451
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Being Human

452
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
Not because it's paid gave them right

453
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Therefore

454
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
To my understanding in my belief

455
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
If you

456
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Are someone who isn't a citizen

457
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
We still can't treat me like s*** your person

458
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Yeah you're right

459
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Are granted by God

460
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,000
Not by America

461
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,816
The greatest point the greatest point is that always

462
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,400
Is always that a government cannot give you they can only

463
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,800
Take them away

464
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
Very seriously

465
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Well he also would have been concerned about Putin 10 years

466
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
Two things I posted

467
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
Did a couple of articles on our Twitter

468
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
On the knowledge fight Twitter

469
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
An article about Alex Jones

470
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Former editor

471
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
Who came out and called him a sell-out

472
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
If you have a

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
If anyone knows how to get in touch with him

474
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Tell him to hit us up

475
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
You remember back when

476
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Alex

477
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Was talking about

478
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
How there was going

479
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Concentration

480
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
Austin Airport

481
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
He gave a report from the road

482
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
He was talking about how there was a

483
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
The tape that was going

484
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Come out

485
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Of trump saying the n word

486
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,952
The Apprentice on the road

487
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Maybe drunk

488
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah

489
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:36,096
Yeah I did a little story about this

490
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
Marcos

491
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Mooyah

492
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
A twenty-seven-year-old marketing

493
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,312
Professional from Glasgow who found out

494
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
The editor of prison

495
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Planet pickups

496
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,944
It's a straight-up

497
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
That guy's DM's were open

498
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
And so he

499
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
Just sent him that story

500
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Borzas

501
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
As a prank

502
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,352
He just sent him all this b******* and then went to bed

503
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
Woke up the next day

504
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
And it was almost

505
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Quoting him verbatim

506
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,056
What is Honda Auto Twitter I posted

507
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,080
Exodus story

508
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,872
And you can see their screenshot

509
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
Lots of him interacting with PJ jobs

510
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
And it's insane it's so f****** awesome

511
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
It's just you're busted

512
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,136
You fell for it

513
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
And I looked into it I looked

514
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Try to find that

515
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
It has now been taken

516
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
Infowars.com

517
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,520

Of course he did because why tell the truth

521
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
Why fly

522
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,392
This is Alex

523
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Talking about

524
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Awesome Andrew Jackson

525
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Rhetoric

526
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
It's totally

527
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,008
Probably even more interesting than

528
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
George Washington

529
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,664
Agree I 100 country live

530
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:32,320
If you want to talk to the microwave

531
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
That's impossible

532
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
It's like the Revenant Dusty the Revenant is historically very very accurate an amazing film B amazing Mexican

568
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,216
Yogurtology

569
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,800
When Andrew Jackson

570
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
Moved into the White House

571
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,384
He had a party

572
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
That lasted multiple

573
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,712
Yeah yeah yeah

574
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,016
Windows

575
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Many broken windows

576
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
But the best part

577
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
There is a wheel of cheese

578
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:46,464
Yeah besides of a man

579
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,840
Ever

580
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
DC

581
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Week

582
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Like essentialism

583
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
And that is the that is

584
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
Quintessential Andrew Jackson

585
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
You're correct

586
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
And survive

587
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
He was completely Charmed

588
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Lucknow deal with

589
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,160
New Orleans

590
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Add ships

591
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:22,560
With hundreds of men shooting

592
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:33,568
And they couldn't kill him they were shooting people all around and he stood there in a big black fur coat

593
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,944
Just staring at him with his eyes ammonite

594
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
A remake

595
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
But notice

596
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,648
In the white house there is a

597
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
Box of Jackson

598
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
On a horse

599
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
Right behind Trump

600
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
Amanda Jackson

601
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,680
He's the guy that killed the early Federal Reserve they had then

602
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
He's the guy that survived more than Americans

603
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,640
So crazy

604
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,992
Completing a genocide is one of those things

605
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,880
Trail of Tears

606
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,976
What is a rainbow one of the reasons he's clearly lionizing Andrew Jackson right now

607
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
How can I

608
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
To literally go up to the Supreme Court and say

609
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,192
I'm going to do it anyway f*** you

610
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:37,056
He was the last Heat while he wasn't last present but he was one of the main president

611
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,128
Who tried to break the whole checks and balances

612
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
He tried to become

613
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,760
If you believe in The Narrative of the

614
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,576
The Elders of Zion and the Illuminati and

615
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
The Federal Bank

616
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,416
Disorder if you believe all of that

617
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,976
There is something to be set

618
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
Is it is

619
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,144
It's like okay

620
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
It's pointed out freaky

621
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
That Andrew Jackson tried to bring us back to

622
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Gold standard

623
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
And yet

624
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
He is on the $20 bill

625
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
Not anymore right

626
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:17,248
We're getting close to that we're not there yet

627
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
But are you still on the twenty-dollar bill

628
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
It pointed out that is ironic

629
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,184
That he hated paper money so much

630
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah yeah

631
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,792
Fiat currency do you think that is

632
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
Purposeful shade

633
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
No you don't think so

634
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,656
How could it not be

635
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
What person working in the treasury was like

636
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,872
Let's put Andrew Jackson on

637
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
As a memorial

638
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
Without knowing any history of Andrew Jackson

639
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,064
Somebody completely ignorant of Andrew Jackson knowledge

640
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,624
Remember the new that only the stuff that to Alex

641
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:01,792
The stuff about him standing up on top of a ship and menacing people in

642
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,120
Look handsome anything at all these duels

643
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,496
Which were mostly about how his wife was a hore

644
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:15,872
Beat a man to death he almost killed Amanda

645
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,944
Well they have very similar hair

646
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,272
All right. Goes on a little bit

647
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
You said something at the end of this

648
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Buckwild

649
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:32,512
George Washington's wife was an unbelievable as well but true I got to tell you he's

650
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Easily

651
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
Andrew Jackson with the sheer magic Providence

652
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,496
Okay

653
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,384
He get stabbed or shot in duels bleed for 3 Days blood everywhere

654
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
Who is Oregon's wouldn't die or refuse to die

655
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Images

656
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
He was wild

657
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
It was wild

658
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
But now this clip takes a turn

659
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
Into the most

660
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Phone directory

661
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Oh I know sorry

662
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
That's the next episode

663
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:17,056
As far as the profile

664
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Because

665
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
He was something else

666
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,712
And the fact that

667
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Into the guts of spines

668
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Good freaking reason

669
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
He also says that like

670
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Washington

671
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,168
Was the first Ford

672
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
You gave birth to The Republic

673
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,360
Manator Jackson was a second father of the Republic Trump is going to be the third

674
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
Sobriety

675
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Although

676
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
I will say the Muslim man is the closest corollary to

677
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,928
The Trail of Tears that we have right now

678
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,768
Choosing one of the worst American president

679
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
History

680
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
As The Shining Light Of America

681
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,960
Just because singular point that he tried to stop the Federal Reserve

682
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Yeah

683
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,776
The only thing that's really important

684
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
Because he does buy into the Elders of Zion

685
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
If he does buy into this idea

686
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
Of these cryptobanker

687
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
Who are just trying to manipulate everything in Destroyer

688
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
Turn us into slaves

689
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:39,232
Too far wrong you know they are evil

690
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,560
Today we need to talk about

691
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
What's on our plate

692
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
What's on our plate

693
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Is more Andrew Jack

694
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
No

695
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
Although it's close

696
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
Weird

697
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,152
British intelligence tried to get the South to secede just like it's later

698
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
Try to break the country

699
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
Killed

700
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,112
Wait what

701
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Wait what

702
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Wait what

703
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Wait what

704
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
What

705
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Woody woody woody conducive

706
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Continue the

707
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
That is all checks

708
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
President of Texas

709
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,504
Noses

710
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
Everything is shut off so

711
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Andrew Jackson

712
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,536
Who covertly sit-in basically the special ops of the day to set up Texas

713
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,328
President

714
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Where what

715
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,472
It's amazing

716
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
So now

717
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
I like

718
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
Covertly is

719
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
More like overly sent an army

720
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,968
Right right right

721
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
It wasn't like

722
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
Three or four guys like

723
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,344
Sidled up to Mexico relax

724
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
How about that

725
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
You're like that Texas

726
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
No it's more like hey

727
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,072
How about we take Mexico to

728
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Andrew Jackson

729
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,448
Is the closest President we have to Yosemite

730
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,264
Yeah but then that that

731
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,896
Cinebarre

732
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
But then here

733
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:39,808
I don't want to bore you with all of them no more stuff I know about it accidentally stopped the last

734
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Best Clip 2

This

736
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
What is a round clip

737
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,208
The biggest

738
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
Kyla b*******

739
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,304
Acting I've ever seen in my life

Just enjoy cuz I don't know how you would do that

741
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,008
Jackson part is over but he does space work

742
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856

Hey good lookin I'm only here I'm a call you back okay

744
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
New York prison

745
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,688
What's great is that the angle of

746
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
That wasn't even the angle of his phone on the video

747
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Even see the screen is still black

748
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:53,280
Act like there's no indication that a call is coming in and just like put it up to

749
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
Like its improv space

750
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,216
It's actually his self

751
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,032
He is

752
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,592
He is doing a radio

753
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
He has his phone on the

754
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,528
Set right there you know how like Stephen Colbert or I would have food under the table that uses

755
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Yeah it's like that

756
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
He has his phone that he describes and

757
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
He's actually saying like

758
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
I'll call you back

759
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,512
He's taking the phone away from this place

760
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,400
There's no way you're not you're not on a call this is planned plan

761
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,496
The plan is to make it look like he has Insider sources calling him

762
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
Oh so he wasn't that was

763
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
That was just really bad at lying

764
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:45,248
Who would have been on the Jerome

765
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,624
Horsey maybe they have no idea what

766
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
That

767
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
He does the show at the

768
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Same time

769
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,072
Every goddamn day let's also consider that he doesn't have their number saved

770
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:05,472
Call Adam New Yorker

771
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Alright

772
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,336
What b******* that is amazing

773
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,176
Yeah yeah absolutely

774
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Canada calling and you wouldn't

775
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
She's a model

776
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,136
Really cool though we love talk

777
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,232
You guys ever read books

778
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
Alright Jordan

779
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
The next one

780
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Yes

781
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,448
Alex likes to do media criticism

782
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,800
The only thing he criticizes

783
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
Is always going to be Transformers

784
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
And cooking

785
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
Correct

786
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
This is

787
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
The clip from CNN

788
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
About

789
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,552
How is involved

790
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
Anvil like Ivory the pens

791
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
Situation over it is pretty crazy

792
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,400
Infiltrate every member of NATO and influence the outcome bringing nationalistic weirdos

793
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,008
That's crazy

794
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
This isn't his critique

795
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
About

796
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
That very story

797
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
The British intelligence

798
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,600
In the Civil War are we not going to deal with that at all

799
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Oh no

800
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Through that in and then we're going to bail out or was playing by the

801
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
And we forgot that

802
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,968
My whole family

803
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
Congrats

804
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,368
That's like the exact same thing

805
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,488
Sherman

806
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
F*** you

807
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Get back to this in a later

808
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
So this is this

809
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Analysis

810
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
That eyes

811
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Jump Trucking

812
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Using similar tactics

813
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
Power structure in case.

814
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,704
Never comes out corrupt about officials

815
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
America or in Russia

816
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,032
Or else directions

817
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,175
If your wife catches you cheating on her the Russians did it

818
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,783
Brady and others didn't win

819
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,879
I was Superbowl Sunday you know there's a meme

820
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
No

821
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,095
It's white supremacy players

822
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,679
So you just literally said I'm not joking

823
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,215
So he must mean it

824
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
He clearly means

825
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,567
That batshit-crazy City said no one no one

826
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Memes that

827
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
No one says that

828
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Legitimately

829
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,271
You know how memes are always 100%

830
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,879
Flexicrew

831
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
No so we know that memes are joke

832
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,791
This goes back to Henry know that the British

833
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,887
Influence the Russian Civil War

834
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
Yep all right

835
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
This goes back to him on Rogan being like

836
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
Not understanding if you were joking when they say he's Bill heck

837
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,615
Yeah not understanding the people are f****** around

838
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
If anybody says that the Russians

839
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
Call

840
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
The Patriots to win

841
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
Super Bowl

842
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,831
Released

843
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
Have to be under attack that's why the right-wing is never fun

844
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
Yeah cuz they always have to be under attack

845
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Far enough

846
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,583
Like they don't understand the absurdity

847
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Of that where it's like

848
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,727
Yeah we know the Russians we know did one thing

849
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
So

850
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,567
If it's if it's one thing which

851
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
Thedirty.com is now being corroborated

852
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
It's all over

853
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,551
Our government committed all kinds of trees in Edwardsville just fine

854
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,903
Flame f****** small flower

855
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,255
That's the real

856
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,815
Public

857
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,143
At best you violated the Logan Act

858
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,679
Worst

859
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
He should be hung on the

860
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
But

861
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Yeah

862
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,639
It's all peace stuff no it's not

863
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
You can't

864
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Go to far you know

865
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,527
So with the left the idea is always good not even though

866
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
Funny people

867
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
It's always going to be

868
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
This is silly

869
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
How this is

870
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,231
So let's go and put it in different situation

871
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
Let's find an analog

872
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,607
And it's even sillier there but if you're the right wing

873
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
It always has

874
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:30,847
Become silly but I realize it's silly all the time I think that what you're also getting to

875
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,895
Is that the right wing in the right

876
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:40,063
Kind of isn't able or not able to be unwilling to engage an abstract thinking

877
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Yeah it's all concrete

878
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
It's all like

879
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
These memes

880
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Is part of the Super Bowl

881
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,863
Sing the end as we all know only the Sith deal in absolutes

882
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
I did not know that

883
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
The news

884
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Well it's fake

885
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,847
It was in Star Wars

886
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
We haven't even gotten to the media criticize

887
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
This is f****** banana

888
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,735
Let's do it alright

889
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:11,295
Have you started the f******

890
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,623
Flexon that Brian stelter guy

891
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Gets worse

892
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,583
You just haven't mean are Russians

893
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,191
The Russians didn't make the Patriots win

894
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
Korea

895
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
What is it feeling office

896
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:36,895
These are all real things that current members of Congress believe

897
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Again he does not realize

898
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
Types of tongue

899
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
Yep and

900
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,111
Not really saying that someone is invading Korea

901
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Whoever which is

902
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,511
Not it's not a it's an easy

903
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,703
Sure and maybe you let loose that you believe in 12

904
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:06,335
Sure you would want that to be held against you like you wouldn't want somebody to take that clip

905
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
And then put it on

906
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
And talk

907
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
Leslie about it

908
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
I think that's pretty different

909
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,183
Your evidence that Democrats are insane

910
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
R1 slip-of-the-tongue

911
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,535
In terms of Nancy Pelosi saying

912
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
That bush is in office

913
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Don't you met Trump

914
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
And then the other

915
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,447
Primary Korea

916
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
Which sounds very similar

917
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,823
Lapses

918
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,871
Play those clips for a week

919
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
You got

920
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
Nothing nothing

921
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,039
It's like the Jay Leno like a man on the street interviews

922
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Cherry Picked

923
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Basilius

924
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Workout

925
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:55,487
If you if you get your friend cuz he has a man on the street named Mark Dice

926
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,303
And he goes out there.

927
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,119
The back there's such good names

928
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
People with names like his we wouldn't wind up

929
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,055
Evil sound like Agenda 21

930
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
Dirty version of corn name

931
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407

Jon rappoport is fine is the last name is fun

936
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
David

937
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
Big dick light

938
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
What type of drugs are they on

939
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
What's wrong

940
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,623
Oh my gosh

941
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:00,255
The French

942
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,351
The Russians pulled out of globalism as well 18 19 years ago

943
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:16,383
Of New World Order social engineering Proto globalism

944
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
We got to interrupt his way more than I expected

945
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Wait what

946
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,807
The only evidence that the Russians did it is that the Russians

947
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
Did it first used

948
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
The oligarch

949
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Battle narrative

950
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:35,327
Yes that is them taking out globalism

951
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:40,447
Right there on the Vanguard of the New Nationalism movement

952
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,567
The brexit

953
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,455
The Italians are trying to get out of the EU right things like that are all like

954
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Oh yeah this is

955
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
This is just realizing our sovereignty and getting out of

956
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,159
Unelected international law

957
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
Mount baby

958
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
You don't get to

959
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,095
To join the EU if you're elected government doesn't say like eyelids

960
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
Join the EU

961
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,703
Complicated process

962
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Yeah

963
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,775
Maybe don't just jump

964
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
Maybe what are you saying is that when the EU start

965
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
Okay they were grandfathered in because we needed a sounding

966
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,783
Until like France got in on the ground floor

967
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
We should stop going to war with each other for thousands

968
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
That was a really good team to get

969
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Sure as this party

970
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
That team

971
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
Like by the definition of the word team

972
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,959
Yeah I'm not here to say that the EU is the

973
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,055
For the world is perfect

974
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
Weird but I am I am

975
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,407
Saying that some sort of international

976
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
You working together is an incredibly positive

977
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,319
And the reason that it's done is because of a

978
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Cities that have happen

979
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
And hoping

980
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:07,487
And hoping and working

981
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
F******

982
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
Hopefully

983
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
But they won't happen again

984
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
That's the reason that International bodies

985
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
Exist

986
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,287
And the rise of nationalism suggest for that

987
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
It's like a it's like a

988
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Angela

989
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
People want

990
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
Atrocities to happen

991
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
Well the last time

992
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,735
You know the UN was created

993
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,783
After World War II

994
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,439
That was really the last time that nationalism had a really aggressive

995
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
Flare up

996
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
So

997
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Forgot

998
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
The ramifications of that type of

999
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
We pretend that what happened there was fake news

1000
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
Fake news

1001
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
Some people do

1002
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Why are people

1003
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Bad at being

1004
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
I don't know what would happen

1005
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
People were not bad

1006
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,271
I don't know maybe

1007
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
How do you

1008
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Neither

1009
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,183
Actually I've I've I've done been denied the Holocaust

1010
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,655
No I went out into the forest

1011
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,727
I've done some research into Holocaust deniers

1012
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,799
Don't deny that

1013
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
The Holocaust happen

1014
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,663
Okay

1015
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,247
They believed that there were

1016
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
And mass killings of Jews

1017
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
They also believe that the Six Million number is off

1018
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,695
Okay because it was published

1019
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Beforehand

1020
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,255
What was the Holocaust

1021
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
Who predicted the sea

1022
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Six million Jews would be

1023
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,095
Be killed OK and then

1024
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
6 million is now the number

1025
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Coincidence

1026
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,495
Okay but then also called the bullet holder

1027
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,311
All right there other arguments they make

1028
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,871
Is that they were

1029
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
They were work

1030
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
Champs

1031
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
And then there was

1032
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
Tons of aggressive bombing campaign

1033
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,039
Germany

1034
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,343
And Supply chains got cut off

1035
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
And they didn't have medication

1036
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Food

1037
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,719
Slave camp

1038
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
Ended up dying

1039
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
They weren't math

1040
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,815
Killed they just died

1041
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
Because of circumstance

1042
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:29,055
But those are some argument

1043
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,407
Yeah those are tires that are like

1044
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,223
This is

1045
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,831
It always it always comes back to that as long as you are only looking

1046
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
For

1047
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Supports the already

1048
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
The crazy thing is

1049
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
You will continue to believe that

1050
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,279
So any information that doesn't

1051
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
Support that you just reject out of course

1052
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,143
Because you can always look for more information

1053
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
But there's also a great episode of

1054
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,055
Montel has weekly

1055
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
Montel had a great episode about Holocaust

1056
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Denial

1057
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:09,247
Yeah it's crazy

1058
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,879
Really interesting

1059
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
F******

1060
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,207
Hot Fire

1061
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,279
Straight up interesting conversation

1062
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,815
He has his daytime show

1063
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,119
Haha

1064
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
On there

1065
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
2 survivors

1066
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,007
F****** crazy

1067
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
8 Ball

1068
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:37,663
What what's crazier is it survives just beat the deniers

1069
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,687
Civil

1070
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
Sort of discussion about stuff

1071
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,271
And the audience asking

1072
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
10 questions

1073
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,879
Is not it's not like a raucous everyone's mad at each other

1074
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,463
Perspectives being laid out into it's amazing

1075
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Montel

1076
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,327
If we need him right now

1077
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
I never thought

1078
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,215
Never before ordered on this planet

1079
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,543
That we need Motel right now

1080
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
People that first

1081
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Experience

1082
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
On a show together and it doesn't turn into a fight

1083
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,319
Is that in the Maze I highly recommend you watch it

1084
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
See Jerry Springer version of that would have gotten

1085
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,159
We're hiring

1086
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,951
We're hiring

1087
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
CNN

1088
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Fake news

1089
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Yes

1090
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,399
God

1091
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,703
Struggled

1092

Are there still big Loveless combines in Russia still 10

1093
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
Just like

1094
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,431
Inside the state department

1095
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
Look at this guy

1096
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,575
The French braid

1097
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,415
About the French

1098
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:12,127
Islamic Jihad people

1099
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
Let's go back to the ridiculous face

1100
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Accounts

1101
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
Of many of these

1102
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,183
Wingstop

1103
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,975
Basically work

1104
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,303
And they puts doing themselves and they dress weird

1105
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,095
Then what the trendy's do

1106
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
God

1107
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
I love him

1108
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:39,519
He's playing I got his title here

00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,151
Yeah and he has a mustache

1111
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,455
And I

1112
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,391
Insane facial hair look terrible

1113
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,975
Spine it's not comical

1114
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
But Alex

1115
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,791
Have to f****** latch onto this

1116
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:07,167
Right because so long as you have a weird appearance

1117
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,191
None of your opinion

1118
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Matter

1119
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
Now

1120
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,055
Enjoy the rest of this which is just

1121
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
Fasting

1122
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Of his face

1123
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Wonderful

1124
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,271
And they want to look strange I mean this guy looks like what cartoon character does he look like

1125
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,415
You trying to come up with Snidely Whiplash

1126
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
He never does

1127
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
But the guy at

1128
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
Behind the scenes

1129
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Comes up with Schneider

1130
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Put them up on there

1131
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,495
He didn't go with Pepe Le Pew

1132
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Alright

1133
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Everything was going to erupt

1134
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,887
Yeah I bet we don't interrupt

1135
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
Supremacy

1136
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,543
Which again is not with this guy's

1137
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,615
Homophobe white supremacist Russian agent

1138
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
Music mixer

1139
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,943
Russia

1140
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:30,879
Bo's but always do the same thing in different orders this is a great intellectual grab

1141
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Sabotage

1142
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Personal account

1143

00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,423
Villains out of Central Casting

1164
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
No no no it's the fault of the Russian intelligence that leaked almost all of it

00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,175
He was on the payroll

1174
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Couldn't

1175
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Confirm it

1176
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,807
He was a paid client. Thank God we finally got to

1177
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,831
To the bottom of Hillary

1178
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,695
Thank God I would have been still mad if we can get to the bottom of it

01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,871
Really disagree with him

1259
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
That's true

1260
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,247
From Seattle

1261
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,343
About how Putin's real cool nationalism is awesome

1262
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:24,415

01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
This guy but he was

1264
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Goddamn

1265
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,535

1266
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:41,055
Mister creepy

1267
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175

Look at that guy Mister creepy probably

1271
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,631
This guy

1272
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
They disrupted

1273
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,519
Beademons television broadcast

1274
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:15,359
They had such arrogance

1275
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,431
Sdv little scripted

1276
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,527
And then just

1277
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Total confidence

1278
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:30,719
They disrupted Lamar

1279
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,655
Corruption it's the Russians

1280
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,751
Do you see my little 18th century beard

01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,079
That's insanity

1282
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
That's so

1283
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
But that's so vapid that's

1284
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
I really like how

1285
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
Engaged with the guys

1286
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,039
Ideas

1287
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
A policy wonk based

1288
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,951
Yeah really more about policy that it was

1289
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:07,071
Devoid of any conversation about what he said we played 100% about

1290
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
How he was foppish replayed

1291
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Twice

1292
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,191
The guy

1293
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,727
I remember his name it's cyber

1294
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
Security Experts

1295
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
Columbia University

1296
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,359
Loved ones family members

1297
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,431
Which because

1298
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
We allow his clips

1299
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,807
Just a little bit longer than that

1300
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,879
Substantially longer

1301
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
Replayed

1302
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Play-Doh

1303
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
Twice

1304
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,511
This guy saying that those

1305
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:40,607
People would be excellent targets for the Cage movie

1306
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,167
Yep if I was in the KGB

1307
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,751
Cuz then maybe his father

1308
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,151
You could find some way to

1309
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,551
Alex doesn't engage with that at all either just engages with the mustache

1310
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,903
And weird assumption that I have this guy's a f****** pedophile

1311
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
And it's

1312
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
It's insane it's

1313
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
It's it's

1314
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,487
Literally

1315
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,535
8v absent

1316
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,815
Journalism

1317
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
It's not bad journalism

1318
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
It's journalism in a vacuum

1319
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,215
Let's get to our next

1320
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
Cuz I have

1321
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,055
Some f****** numbers on this one

01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,591
I'm excited

1323
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895

40 million

1329
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
What are they going to do

1330
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,095
They're going to try to say

1331
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,167
It's amazing

1332
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
It is amazing

1333
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,519
I'm not going to try and say that he's a Russian

1334
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:58,687
But what I am going to say is that it's 50 million people took us and if you encounter if you can't rub

1335
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,783
Minutes 40 million really sure what that mean

1336
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
Does that mean that Rogan

1337
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
Accounts for 40 million of the 50 million or ten million

1338
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,559
Alien from the 50 billion

1339
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
The 50 million people took in his

1340
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Work

1341
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
And the latter 85 million 50 last week

1342
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
Let's break out

1343
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
Okay

1344
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,431
Alright

1345
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
I know that everyone can

1346
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
You see it all over the world

1347
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
Okay let's take this

1348
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
She's probably

1349
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
Let's Imagine This

1350
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,903
Just inside the United

1351
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183

Venom please

1354
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,535
Extrapolated to the wrestler population

1355
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,839
The United States

1356
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
300 issue million people

1357
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
If you want to get

1358
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
50 million people listening to your show

1359
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543

Every single man woman and child

1362
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
In the top

1363
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
52 City

1364
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
In United State

1365
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,343
I still only 40

1366
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
To give you some context

1367
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
That's every city

1368
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,743
Including Bakersfield California

1369
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
And higher

1370
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
Okay field California and up

1371
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,239
Throughout the world

1372
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,311
That's how many people listen to

1373
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Second

1374
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
In order to get 50

1375
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,455
50 million people or 85 billion

1376
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,223
People listening to your

1377
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
Johnny Carson

1378
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,831
And even then

1379
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
I don't think that

1380
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,767
50 million people is cool

1381
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
But it's 50 million hits

1382
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,095
There are artificial hip

1383
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,119

1394
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,391
Russian troll Farm

1395
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183

1396
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,559
Yeah you have all these fake numbers that end of happenings Million number

1397
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,351
There's no way for me to prove what the

1398
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,399
Of course not

1399
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,983
But the entire population of the

1400
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,775
52 cities

1401
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
In America

1402
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
Throughout the world

1403
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
Take all of this

1404
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
People in the last

1405
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Week

1406
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
Engaged

1407
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
No f****** way

1408
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
Cuz if that's the case

1409
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,903
You're a f****** Rockstar astronaut

1410
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
Yeah he would be

1411
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
You'd be a billionaire

1412
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,863
You know what would happen he would be a billionaire like all the things he sells

1413
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
Hearing his

1414
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
His doors up

1415
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
Heart trying to

1416
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
To get as much out of his shows integrity integrity that's true

1417
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
I feel like we need to call ourselves

1418
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
Because

1419
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,231
Episode where he was giving that fake bulshit

1420
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,279
About what happened on Y2K

1421
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,375
Yes we were too busy calling out all the other stuff around it

1422
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,935
The we forgot to call out the in his story

1423
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,983
She didn't even call out that

1424
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
Houston sectionalism

1425
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,591
Wasn't about Y2K

1426
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:45,247
It was not about Y2K episode had nothing

1427
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,831
We we did a bad job forgot about

1428
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
Yeah okay

1429
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:55,999
That's the problem he's a b******* onion

1430
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:01,119
Anyway let's get to the next narrative this one is about Trump

1431
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Could be doing

1432
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
Would be

1433
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Way better

1434
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
Horrified

1435
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,711
Not good

1436
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
Absolutely

1437
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:31,583
Was North and South playoff against each other absolutely

1438
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:36,703
2.1 million light years more

1439
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:45,151
Trump's a big old

1440
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
Those aren't words I have read

1441
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
He has not read a hundred bucks in it

1442
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,959
No but also him

1443
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,519
Struggling with Jefferson

1444
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
Meet

1445
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,151
Now as far as the Lincoln are there 100 books about

1446
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
Self-absorbed

1447
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,271
No

1448
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
As far as

1449
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
As far as Lincoln

1450
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,927
Arresting of judges

1451
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,695
Journalist

1452
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,999
What was published

1453
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Was

1454
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,559
A

1455
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
Fake Proclamation that was

1456
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
Purportedly signed by Lincoln

1457
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
Okay so

1458
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
The journalist then published

1459
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
That supposedly was said by link

1460
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
That was so

1461
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Porting

1462
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
The South

1463
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:53,759
So it was basically while they were at War

1464
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
But such

1465
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
That it was like

1466
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,623
Set out to the rest of the world saying hey

1467
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Ditto

1468
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
So all the things that

1469
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
When did

1470
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,071
Is basically those but you're a newspaper

1471
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,911
It was a it was legitimate reason

1472
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,239
Read more books

1473
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
Let's find out

1474
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
You're so on

1475
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,455
Washington

1476
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:35,999
Are you going to a college when the professor the teacher

1477
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,935
Go

1478
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Interesting

1479
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:09,023
That's unconstitutional

1480
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:25,407
It's in the White House

1481
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
Who

1482
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,183
There is a coup against President Trump

1483
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,279
That's why he's racing to cut your taxes

1484
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:46,143
Racing to Trump up the economy of f*** you

1485
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:04,319
I love his his number of books read is very

1486
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:09,695
200 200

1487
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Styx

1488
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,047
20 of the Civil War

1489
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,375
It's the only open 6 of the books

1490
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
Mention Lake

1491
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:24,799
That could be a Venn diagram situations

1492
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
Close books might have been also the Civil War Book

1493
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
Suggest

1494
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,479
His focus is on

1495
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:38,879
A president

1496
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,695
Civil War

1497
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,791
Would you think

1498
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,607
But it was a British psyop

1499
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
It's a British

1500
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,423
6th and Lincoln

1501
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
I'm guessing now

1502
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Call me crazy

1503
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
My thought

1504
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,871
Baby the six books that he read on Lincoln

1505
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,663
We're not about how Lincoln

1506
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Was a great America

1507
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
They might be

1508
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Holocaust

1509
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Denier version

1510
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
Lincoln book

1511
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:12,159
As there are so many of those

1512
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Pictures of people who

1513
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
Think it was uncalled

1514
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,743
Constitutional for Lincoln to fight

1515
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Civil War

1516
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
Sure now

1517
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,095
That's a really interesting question

1518
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,775
If you really wanted to be a dick about it though

1519
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Yeah you get into it

1520
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,335
Admittedly

1521
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
If you're looking at the

1522
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
The situation we're living in

1523
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,455
Now I was trying to think that we lost this war

1524
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:41,343
Cuz it sounds really took over didn't that they rose again we left it there

1525
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,135
For so long they rose again

1526
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
Get back to Alec

1527
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463
Area code

1528
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,255
What is a teaser

1529
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,839
This is a teaser Alex's

1530
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
Bombshells

1531
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,959
No honor next episode

1532
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,519
We are going to DeLand

1533
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,799
In detail

1534
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,871
He's about to talk about here but

1535
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,711
Android

1536
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Imagine

1537
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Next episode

1538
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:18,207
Found the keys to the kingdom

1539
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,447
4 degrees and prepare you for a simulation into the corporate board

1540
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,951
You do and it's metaphysical

1541
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,327
I mean you could

1542
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
We'll get to it happen

1543
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:03,519
Listen to that our last night

1544
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
And I was thinking

1545
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
It's time to get some

1546
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Our last

1547
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:10,175
It's not a prey prey on this out

1548
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,735
Also I'd like to give the world a little bit

1549
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Insight into me

1550
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
The only thing I've done

1551
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
My degree

1552
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,111
Qualified for jobs

1553
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Done Coke

1554
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
How is it

1555
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,767
Said he get some

1556
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
Things go right for

1557
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
Wrong read

1558
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,607
Yeah I agree

1559
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
There are so many worth

1560
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Degrees

1561
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
You are a simulator

1562
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Did into the board

1563
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,775
There plenty of times

1564
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
Where is button

1565
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
It's not a difficult

1566
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,383
Nobody

1567
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:44,991
It's not a monster thing this is where we get into logic it's just the system that broke.

1568
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Logic

1569
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
A2B

1570
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,087
Is a is true

1571
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
B must be

1572
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
I believe

1573
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,463
It's truth preservation

1574
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,791
Yes so you're saying that degrees are worthless

1575
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
Therefore this

1576
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,351
Is a death cult

1577
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,447
And that's the problem for us we agree with

1578
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:08,031
Don't agree with me cuz it doesn't lead to be

1579
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,847
No that's how it's supposed to work

1580
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
Your premises

1581
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
You have to say

1582
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
Degrees are worthless

1583
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,527
And then another thing in order to

1584
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
Maybe justify the conclusion

1585
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,647
I'm so far you've done none of that

1586
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:28,511
So so our problem is that he

1587
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:33,375
That's where we all get into trouble starts with B I love B

1588
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
Now it's b*******

1589
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
This one a thing

1590
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,543
I bet people would

1591
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
Sign off on beef

1592
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,407
It starts so good

1593
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,943
It starts a good

1594
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Logical fallacy is starting from the King

1595
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,527
Conclusion

1596
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:55,903
It's what people do a lot you already decide what you want to believe and figure out how to

1597
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,463
But this clip isn't done

1598
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Here's where Alex

What are we going to do

1601
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:11,519
It was just his voice and just his is focusing his understanding

1602
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,567
Is gravitas

1603
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:19,456
Population by researchers

1604
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,296
Is a piece of work

1605
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,416
I do agree he's a piece of work

1606
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:32,256
But my tone is very different when I say

1607
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:39,424
Rapport

1608
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:51,200

Back and forth in that room

At least

1627
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984

Smooth f****** transition is just like

Coming out of a break

01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:55,072
That was a commercial for that was a commercial break

1682
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,120
That's why they can sell there

1683
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:03,264
S*** for free yeah I just do their commercials on the show so it was part of the show

01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,176
You're just selling stuff

01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,504
During your actual show

1688
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
Yeah or at least

1689
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:20,928
Let's say I don't know some sort of mouthpiece for the governor

1690
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
Right

1691
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,792
And you use your position as a mouthpiece for the government

1692
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
To advert

1693
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
Let's say

1694
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,912
The daughter of the president

1695
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680

That's super across is that okay

1698
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,848
I'm not okay with it

1699
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,616

01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
To sell North

1708
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
Scrumptious

1709
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
My Korean Conway

1710
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,776
August

1711
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,824
Legitimately admit

1712
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
He's

1713
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:15,200
Just broadcasting classified information

1714
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,576
But he says that's what he's doing

1715
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
So

1716
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,792
But they classify everything I enzymes going to tell you

1717
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,472
Where you can take a picture of somebody and run it on your computer

1718
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
Find person

1719
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,320
Picture

1720
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,352
What

1721
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,168
Facial recognition technology does

1722
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
Exist

1723
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,264
I don't know if you've noticed that but Google

1724
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,872
Actually really bad that like they don't do great job

1725
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920
Now they're trying to make that better

1726
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,688
Because yeah

1727
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,504
I think that is kind of a goal for them

1728
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,344
Right if you were if you were shadow

1729
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,648
Agency you would want to know everybody's faces that all time

1730
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,976
Because as we know we can always

1731
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,512
Trust shadowy secret government

1732
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
Used to have our best in

1733
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:43,264
And also what do you think about the idea that late just saying

1734
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,384
Literally illegal

1735
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,176
Is that why they have class

1736
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:54,784
Certified material is so you don't share it literally what he just did there is illegal

1737
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
It's illegal

1738
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,576
If if

1739
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,880
Don't do we have laws anymore

1740
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,928
That is adorable

1741
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,488
If that's actually classified information

1742
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
That was a crime

1743
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
Now

1744
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,328
Here here

1745
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,864
I'll just flip one for you

1746
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,912
Okay

1747
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,472
I shouldn't tell you this

1748
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,008
Okay well tell me anyways

1749
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,056
Whooping tell me on air

1750
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
NSA

1751
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
I think

1752
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Nachos

1753
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
It's classified

1754
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,064
I'd like as an organization or

1755
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,136
Okay

1756
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,928
Information of making up s***

1757
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,976
Then it's not really a crime

1758
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,536
But if he was just literally spouting

1759
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:42,400
If that was real

1760
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,936
It would be classified what

1761
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,728
No like you would want to share p

1762
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
You wouldn't want to share that

1763
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
You could recognize

1764
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,616
Also know I don't think so what border is a g

1765
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Jihad

1766
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,712
Canada

1767
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:00,320
Flight from Mexico from Sudan

1768
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,088

Love the place work

Don't exist

1772
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,024
All these millions of July

1773
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,376
By the way my

1774
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960

CIA

1781

Jihad

1782
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,040
Jihadi car wash

1783
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,320

1789
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536

You love swimming through that or that Chinese billionaires trying to overcome

1792
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
I want to say this

1793
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,248
On the show which is lookout for this word

1794
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
Americana

1795
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,344
I really think

1796
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,368
Is going to turn in

1797
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,392
Into pretty soon

1798
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,952
It's going to be a buzzword it's already abuzz

1799
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:14,304
I could be a buzzword for white nationalism

1800
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
I'm at that sort of thing

1801
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,632
It sounds good

1802
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,936
He's kind of been a buzzword for

1803
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,216
White people doing White

1804
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,544
Okay

1805
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,640
And then also remember earlier

1806
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,176
When he told you that Monday

1807
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,224
Story on the Ellipsis

1808
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,552
Are we going to get to go to heaven

1809
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,840
You're looking at the same thing on the same road together

1810
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:52,448
Also like it Powers also I f****** love the people keep asking

1811
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
Who asked

1812
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,408
Listen to the Paul Stanley album

1813
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,944
That lead lead singer of Kiss

1814
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,504
Yeah I know is I've never listened to

1815
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,320
His own album there's an album of just his face

1816
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:14,720
Pattern about that one

1817
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
Crazy hour-and-a-half

1818
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
And it's him

1819
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,608
Doing like

1820
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,680
Intros to songs God and he

1821
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,496
He constantly says people keep asking me

1822
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,688
And Alex Jones just did that

1823
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,784
You asked you that keep coming up to me

1824
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,808
Tasty Alix

01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
My say what

1826
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
They say Alex

1827
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,160
How do you know what Trump

1828
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Was going to do

1829
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:49,280
As they were just born

1830
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,560
Same thing I'm tapping it

1831
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,096
Too bad

1832
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,120
It's the spirit

1833
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,168
Force of America

1834
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,008
Tell each other what to say

1835
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
As on its face

1836
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,336
Prime Aphasia that's why I'm saying

1837
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Very good chance

1838
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:06,944
Reince priebus within 3 weeks will be gone

1839
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
Because

1840
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
He's clearly the liquor

1841
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:15,648
Before the one that continues the basement undermined the president and say that in the presents like a Lost Child in the White House

1842
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,976
All these leagues and Trump's really upset about I know for a fact

1843
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,792
Looking for a new Chief establishing to stop right there

1844
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,096
We're at the big story

1845
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
Everybody show

1846
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
You just gave away the story

1847
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
So so Monday they're going

1848
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:37,408
To have a big story that is

1849
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
When this is our

1850
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,760
Is that that kind of

1851
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
Everything is

1852
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,576
Still f****** awesome but what

1853
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,880
So it doesn't matter

1854
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:53,280
Like literally every day it seems like there's a big story of some crazy s*** happening at the White House

1855
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:56,352
So even if it's not rice priebus is gone

1856
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,168
It could be anything and that isn't

1857
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,448
Story

1858
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,800
But not every day does Alexei I'm not going to tell this story

1859
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Tell the story

1860
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:11,712
Actually I feel like I just do that

1861
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:16,576
This Earth

1862
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
Right

1863
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:24,256
Yeah that's pretty much there is nothing left of teeth

1864
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,888
That would be pretty funny Russia

1865
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,192
Am I 6 trying to make it look like

1866
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,752
Well like how they started the Civil War

1867
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:35,776
Absolutely

1868
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,104

String of interview

01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
So bad

1876
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792

01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,848
Add to his other interview is with Nigel McGuinness

1897
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
Who is the guy who started Vice

1898
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,456
Has there ever been a good night

1899
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
VarageSale

1900
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Nope

1901
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,368
And angels

1902
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,440
Yeah I can't go another night

1903
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,840
What do you get name Nigel s*** is going to go down the library in on Buffy the Vampire

1904
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,776
I don't know I never watched Beth

1905
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
I probably

1906
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,592
Dignity

1907
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,384
Anyway Nigel McGuinness

1908
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Is on

1909
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
He says

1910
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
Some really f***** up things

1911
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,552
The first is not as f***** up

1912
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,624
I don't like to include in our episodes interview stuff

1913
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
Because

1914
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:33,792
Just because then we'll take it out of special

1915
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
Circumstance because of the

1916
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,840
The second clip

1917
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
But the first one

1918
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
Real Shady

1919
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
Okay

1920
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:47,872
Fun

1921
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456
Wow

1922
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
I've never remember the presidency being

1923
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,296
So fun

1924
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
Bond prices

1925
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
You know what

1926
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
Okay

1927
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,440
Alright

1928
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,744
If you were an alien

1929
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
This would be the most fun president

1930
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,840
The ever

1931
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,144
If there was no skin in the game

1932
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,704
This would be a hilarious press

1933
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,240
Also

1934
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
If you're in

1935
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
Uncaring

1936
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,592
Pretty

1937
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,640
Well I assume they're at

1938
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,224
It's pretty tough cuz they have no

1939
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,040
Recognition of the real world it's pretty tough.

1940
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,320
Hear the stories

1941
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,600
Of

1942
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
Ice check

1943
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,648
Points

1944
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,696
You know do you know what's crazy about that

1945
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,744
I I go through all of these

1946
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,768
Conservative websites

1947
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:37,536
Because I am

1948
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
Obsessed with me

1949
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
I'm sure that I

1950
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,352
Every Posse

1951
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
Me too

1952
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
And

1953
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,008
All of the all of the like

1954
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,544
Not even liberal

1955
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
Just like

1956
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,336
Reputable

1957
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
New sources

1958
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,664
Interview

1959
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,944
Interview the people

1960
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Affected by the

1961
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,760
Other Aldi stores

1962
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,576
Everytime I go

1963
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
1 steps

1964
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
To the right

1965
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,416
Any right-wing

1966
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,208
Zero interviews

1967
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
It is all just

1968
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
Ideologically

1969
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
This makes

1970
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,864
On principle

1971
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:17,728
Exactly

1972
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:22,080
People to you yeah

1973
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:22,848
Course

1974
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,896
If you never got any info

1975
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
Information outside of

1976
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Those places

1977
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,480
You would think this is the right thing

1978
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
Thing to do

1979
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,272
Because you never have to

1980
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
To deal with

1981
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Yes

1982
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,392
But all of these all of these supposedly Christian

1983
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Conservative

1984
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:39,488
Really getting to a narrative with them

1985
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
If you really get them

1986
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
Any of this

1987
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:45,120
People they would almost immediately changed

1988
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,912
Hopefully because they're

1989
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,728
If you if you just

1990
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
Finally f****** wreck

1991
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
Guys that other people are the same as you

1992
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,616
Instead of some weird monster

1993
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,920
Instead of some weird other thing

1994
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,200
The moment you

1995
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,064
Drum duet

1996
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,416
Because that's a good point

1997
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:12,512
You'll realize this f****** presidency is

1998
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
It is fun

1999
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
It is

2000
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:22,496
God how funny that I wish people still mad I wish I weren't affected by this because this

2001
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:27,872
Chaos is what I would like if I was watching funny to see people scared if I was

2002
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
If I was watching a

2003
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,688
Basketball game

2004
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:35,040
That was basically the corollary to this where it's all chaos

2005
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,600
People are punching each other for no reason

2006
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:44,256
Outside of what a basketball Globetrotters game mixed with pro wrestling

2007
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
Exactly

2008
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,560
Like when you're watching theater

2009
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,608
If you've been a stand-up for long enough

2010
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,912
Suddenly the only thing that be

2011
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:51,936
Really fun

2012
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:55,008
Is when stand-up goes beyond its the other rail

2013
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
I don't want to see

2014
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:01,152
I like seeing people

2015
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,688
Try to become good at

2016
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:04,992
Great stand

2017
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
But my favorite thing

2018
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,344
Is a f****** lunatic

2019
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,160
Walking on stage and just letting ships

2020
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
Fly

2021
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,232
The flip side of that is watch

2022
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,512
To someone you know

2023
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Situation

2024
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,144
So it's either chaos from the stage or towards the

2025
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,192
Absolutely

2026
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,240
I want to see I want to see s***

2027
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
I've never seen before

2028
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,544
And that's what this

2029
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,848
Kind of espousing

2030
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,200
That's great

2031
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:38,272
Never seen before

2032
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:41,088
Nerves of the world

2033
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,976
Not good. Good families are being broken up as we speak

2034
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:51,840
Frankly even the ship we've seen before is usually bad

2035
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,728
Not just anybody

2036
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,032
Jordan

2037
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:01,824
For this show

2038
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,640
And it is in response

2039
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,920
That showed

2040
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,944
Dear white people

2041
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,736
Why

2042
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,552
Did you watch that

2043
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,880
I want to watch as well

2044
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
The show

2045
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,208
It's good cool

2046
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
Dear white people

2047
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
IWatch

2048
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
The trailer which is all they're worth

2049
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,328
Well

2050
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,888
If they actually responded to reality that would

2051
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
If they watch the trailer

2052
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,752
Where is all just

2053
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
Essentially

2054
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
Don't

2055
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
Do Whiteface

2056
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,736
Generally the

2057
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
That's not cool

2058
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
I am not a costume

2059
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,416
Basically is the line of

2060
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,720
Really good line

2061
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,256
Yeah

2062
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:56,352
If you're that you are a costume

2063
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,632
Yeah

2064
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,704
No no chondrites

2065
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,312
That's where I draw the line Y right

2066
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:08,128
Five so here is

2067
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
Him

2068
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,664
Discussing

2069
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
This

2070
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,224
Nigel McGuinness ends up saying

2071
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,760
One of the worst things

2072
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:14,784
Adan

2073
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,136
I don't know

2074
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,672
I mean Mike.

2075
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,464
TV

2076
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,488
Gardevoir

2077
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,352
Women with an axe to grind

2078
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,376
And I don't

2079
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:32,704
Men

2080
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,152
That trailer has on YouTube it's something like

2081
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,040
It's probably more

2082
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:49,088
Video on the history

2083
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,624
YouTube trailers

2084
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,304
It doesn't make sense because you found the costumes offensive

2085
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:12,640
In the past 10 years

2086
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,408
Every time you

01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
Happening

2183
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,144
It should never happen

2184
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
And

2185
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,704

The victimized class trying to make

2212
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,416

01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,456

01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,784
There's like hey you know the kkk's never asked you to

2221

Here you are

2223

Yeah but

2228
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,152
Statistically anything that can happen will happen

2229
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,688
The bigger issue is

2230
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,248
Does not

2231
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,272
Preclude

2232
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
Us

2233
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,600
From really dealing with the actual hate crimes

2234
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648

But that's but that's a whole thing

2242
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,616
If you Google the opposite

2243
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,152
You can pull up

2244
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,176
300

2245
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,480

2246
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,248
Uniqua

2247
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,784

You remember the one that is the false

2254
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,400
You would report on that like if you're a newsagents

2255
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,192

01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,216
Jordans that was crazy

2278
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,264
Blackface

2279
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Is not

2280
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,360
It was Reverend

2281
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:18,784
Put all of the all of the all of it

2282
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,064
Like all of it

2283
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,880
All of it

2284
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,416
There's no

2285
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
Okay

2286
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
Give me

2287
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,560
Give me like you have

2288
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,120
At least a very bass understanding

2289
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,144
Of race relations

2290
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,704
That is a prime

2291
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:39,520
Give me one situation where blackface

2292
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
Was okay

2293
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
Ever

2294
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
Ever

2295
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Okay

2296
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,208
Alright

2297
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,024
Because 80% of the time

2298
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,072
Reverend so that means that you should

2299
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,120
Ativan

2300
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,424
Eight of them should be

2301
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,448
Okay

2302
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,264
Here is what I was going to say

2303
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,544
Let's go for what

2304
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
Let's just start with one

2305
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,616
Name what I was on my way to the

2306
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,432
And an oil barrel blew up in

2307
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:25,088
Elida show up on set

2308
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,880
And we have to adjust

2309
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,904
Everybody laughs

2310
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,440
Yeah

2311
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,536
It look I mean you could always go back to Al Jolson

2312
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
Right

2313
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,328
Cloud Jolson

2314
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,864
Is a giant pile of s***

2315
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,144
But

2316
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:41,472
Context of the world he lived in

2317
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,008
He's not the one

2318
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,056
Made it possible for

2319
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,080
To be bad

2320
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:46,848
So about 2

2321
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,920
Who's your voice

2322
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:51,456
Exactly like Alex Jones right

2323
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:54,016
Do you like to pitch to my products

2324
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:58,368
Let me tell you that let me tell you something about super male vitality

2325
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,952
If only I took more of it before today

2326
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,000
Also

2327
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,280
Like all of it

2328
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,816
All of it comes down

2329
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
To like

2330
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,632
What's not real litigate

2331
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,912
Right

2332
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
Who cares

2333
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:19,872
Well I know the history in order to make sure that you don't f******

2334
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
Certainly

2335
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,432
Certainly

2336
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,968
Away

2337
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,248
Just add

2338
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:27,808
Okay

2339
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,832

2340
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Bad

2341
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,136
All the people that I do

2342
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Not good

2343
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,208
And College

2344
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,488
Fat are not

2345
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,512
Blackface

2346
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,304
To somehow

2347
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:42,912
Celebrate black people are you sure it wasn't Reverend

2348
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,936
