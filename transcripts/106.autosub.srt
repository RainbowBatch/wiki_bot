Clamoring

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016

Show podcast we hear it all the time

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
When I walk down the street first day you're saying

I love it so much

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Witches

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,824
Why would you listen to a podcast about

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Alex Jones

14
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,968
Beverage store you are supposed to go into the bed

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,368

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
Tourism

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,840
We appreciate you listening for a minute

19
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
You walk up to me

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,496
Tell you about this

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
For the show and I apologize

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Spring this on you but

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
We have a episode 4

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
A foreign policy

25
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Ivar's

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
That was

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,832
He requested that we time travel back to

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,208
And I want to listen to that episode and I was going to get it ready for today

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,792
But it's actually going to require a bit more research

30
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
Oh no damn it is the other level of Alex Jones is anti-Semitism and I don't want to go in

31
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Quit half-cock the blood libel well poisoning kind of narratives of the

32
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Protocols

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
There's a

34
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
There's another level Tuesday upper echelon

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,832
Yes Alex gets into some stuff that I need to read up on a whole bunch more before we do it

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,672
Sew-in in calling an audible I had to figure out and what a weekend

37
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Can you do

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
If you say Carrie Callahan

39
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Nowhere I've tried to find some good good Project Camelot episodes lately but there hasn't been any

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
S*** no but

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Do in episode live

42
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
On Wednesday

44
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,896
A Thanksgiving Eve episode

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,712
I don't feel like I was able to do the

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
The Material Justice

47
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
Okay so there will be a few people who watch this live this correctly dead

48
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
Do yourself after doing a great job.

49
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
Constructing things

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
Why isn't anybody screaming

51
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Yes and so you're doing it again

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,240
Well there's that that's that's part of it but then the other part of it is I feel like

53
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
You are missing out on this stuff too and it would be unfair to deprive you right

54
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Fall behind

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
This is all we've never done this before like re-recorded something

56
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
I'm Flying Blind

57
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,048
So some of the glistening who are in the twitch stream will of heard these clips

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
But you won't have heard them discuss Ride Like This

59
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Reason number two through the first reason or is 3 minutes

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Glistening

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,968
This is

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Okay

63
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
Can we turn this

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Into a

65
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Let's call it

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
What's the name of the movie with Mel Gibson Lethal Weapon

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
We're in a Lethal Weapon situation

68
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
And I'm standing on top of a roof

69
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Hanging on saying let's jump

70
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312

He was pretty nice

98
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,063
Actually I made some joke

Seem like a graceful guy

102
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,511
Like as you could have been I told the joke that I made

103
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,839
Was not good okay I don't remember what it was right

104
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
But it was not good

105
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,519

00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,943
Kobe's autograph

128
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
It was actually

129
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,783
A benevolence weather

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
Not a minor one

131
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
But

132
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:56,767
Shaq was shooting free throws you practicing shooting free throws out of

133
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,375
He was also not like you it was not an intense cracked

134

So I walk up

138
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
The Shack on the court

139
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Because I'm

00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
Shocked by how big he is

142

00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
F****** bouncer

151

00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
Article and

191
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
Discussed it briefly in the past

192
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
It's a

193
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,343
What's article was the way I described it naturally the guy writing it does understand but Alex's

194
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Performance model is to just

195
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Scare people in Enfield

196
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
I'm bailing.

197
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
But he doesn't

198
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,935
He doesn't deal with like the fact the doctor group is on and he's not a doctor I just makes fun of his

199
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,775
Appearance you doesn't get any of the subtext

200
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
The things out

201
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
There's no discussion of any of the

202
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,455
Actual narratives other than there to scare you

203
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
I mean that's fine but you're just getting the surface

204
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Like Bethea

205
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
And that

206
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
F****** New Yorker article I'm still very very angry about

207
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,815
Movie over the weekend

208
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
Gives a f***

209
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Alex

210
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
Pretends to be outraged

211
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Or

212
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
I guess

213
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
This special report is in response to Vice doing that artists

214
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:02,527
Of course I will get into a first-year isn't at a concert

215
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Angle

216
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,183
Does it very interesting

217
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,303
Let's have an out-of-context drop from this episode to give you a little bit of flavor about where we're going to be going

218
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Alright

219
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
That should give you a sense of the Alex Jones worth dealing with here today

220
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Start Staffing

221
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Way better

222
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
I'll tell you that right now

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Lord of the Rings

224
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Listen

225
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Redo all of Lorde's

226
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Sure

227
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
CGI Alex Jones into the Golem Park perfect

228
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,671
Who if you had to recast the rest of the

229
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
With Infowars personalities

230
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Well I would say that is going to be

231
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,287
Boromir's because clearly he's the one who's going to take the whole operation down with his lies okay

232
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
Prada

233
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
It's possible of course

234
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Go fuc yourself John Rappaport

235
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
He's our guy.

236
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
No way gray there's no way we cannot make him get out of the grey

237
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,719
Rob do review is our Samwise gamgee I feel like sample sizes too effective

238
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
I think it's

239
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
I think because Rob do is a fumbling bumbling moron

240
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
I know I could have

241
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Said Eddie Bravo

242
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
We can't do that

243
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,799
Eddie Bravo's heart is too good to be in these values Tom Bombadil

244
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,663
Eddie Bravo is the Tom Bombadil of this

245
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,295
That's right did you think I didn't know Lord of the Rings

246
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,135
Salty about the other night

247
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Me and Jordan

248
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
Girlfriend may have made fun of him but not knowing Lord of the Rings

249
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Ferret

250
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,447
Alright let's get on with it

251
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Here is where we start like I said

252
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
He did a marathon

253
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,919
Yes Vice wrote an article about trying to watch the entire Marathon

254
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Then Alex.

255
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Good Humor when I see it

256
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Device

257
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,695
Popular outfit to work with HBO

258
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Obsessed

259
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Daily basis

260
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,871
34-hour ever

261
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
34 hours today

262
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
He don't recognize

263
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Text Tabitha

264
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Cybermen

265
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
Unwise right now

266
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
At 8 a.m.

267
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
The same

268
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,079
Riveting Transmissions

269
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,479
He absolutely is

270
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
Night being boring a s*** and Alex

271
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
Ghana's basis if to say like

272
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,823
Alex will be in his Marathon

273
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,455
And again like you can tell the artifice immediately from Rob do being like we're doing it

274
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
Okay that's the stuff online you just doing this cuz you

275
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Need money

276
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
They might have even better

277
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
On Cyber Monday

278
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Half of Their audience

279
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
The people 50% off

280
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Free shipping

281
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,263
65% off 75 if you get Auto refill

282
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
What's 10% off if you get Auto auto ship

283
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
CD clubs

284
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
I've gone through and look at reviews of

285
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
His stuff in like

286
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
There's a number of people who complain about

287
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,903
Like automatically getting set up for auto-ship and not realizing it

288
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,231
Hey been making it less hassle to try and get off of it

289
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
That I believe

290
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,071
If you sign a product shipped out that's cuz you're dumb

291
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
The internet is not that

292
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Strew

293
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
Then you get all the stuff

294
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Guarantee

295
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Even if you sells out

296
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
You still get it

297
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
The auto-ship

298
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
That is not real and does not mix

299
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
That is not a real thing that you can do

300
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Again to reset

301
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
You did a marathon Vice wrote a toothless article about it now he's pretending that in order to

302
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Or something like that

303
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
He's doing another Marathon

304
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
When in the reality

305
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,703
Threw it immediately he didn't get enough money from that last one he needs to do another one

306
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
Cyber Monday whenever I buy stuff online perfect time

307
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,359
Bada-bing bada-boom perfectly

308
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Going to complain a little bit

309
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Places like pie

310
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Articles

311
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
Demoralized

312
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
Power absolutely pathetic washer reporting on us constantly

313
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,471
Program

314
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Just start going 24 hours

315
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
What's pissing you off

316
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
We better

317
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
Rakuten

318
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
It's all frivolous

319
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
It hurts my Humanity

320
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
You just described yourself as a missile

321
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
Well but most deaths

322
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
Starkey also maybe a laser

323
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,575
He missed a mixed metaphor cuz at the beginning you talking about other people

324
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Missile

325
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
I don't get it but the way that rambling like metaphor goes like that I mean

326
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
But

327
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Is there

328
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
She was vice

329
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Is the first

330
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Adjectives used

331
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
To describe them

332
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Lengthy

333
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
They write we all would have been like oh yeah

334
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,623
You would have read them talking about how he

335
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,719
Like using amazing showman and even though the content was terrible

336
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,559
The reviewer was talking about how he couldn't wait for Alex

337
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,631
Get back on because if you watch these other things

338
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
It's just like

339
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
Cuz he has a brilliant about him within his

340
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
No one knows

341
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Better than us

342
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
I would say

343
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
So B dude if you're writing another 34-hour

344
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Here's my face

345
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Don't watch it

346
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Call Dad

347
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,815
I can help you out more scathing job

348
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
That's a bad idea

349
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,007
I shouldn't have said that I don't think I'll do it

350
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Okay

351
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,591
I don't think anybody expect you to do it

352
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,455
I mean I could not watch it and do a more thorough recap the most people put

353
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
Although he's probably salaries

354
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
But anyways

355
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Coming out when it's

356
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,607
Too late for anyone to pay me to do it

357
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
Next time

358
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Where City

359
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,639
The other thing that he's mad at about Vice

360
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Goes into what

361
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
He says there at the end

362
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
Humanity

363
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
So many

364
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
People who are getting

365
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,831
Paid to do

366
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,391
Hatchet job so they turn on me

367
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Right

368
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,463
I think that he associate device

369
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
With Gavin McInnes

370
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Okay

371
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Proposition

372
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,423
Yeah but he was out real early

373
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
But I think Alex

374
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
Still thinks that he's super involved with it

375
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
And there's some Lake

376
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,639
This publication should be on my side me and Gavin are cool

377
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,759
And I think there's something like that in his head

378
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
Advanced knowledge and information so I apologize practice Mexico

379
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Let's see if you change your mind

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
I've been contacted this week

381
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Libertarian

382
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Money

383
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Are you okay

384
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,696
They'll be a real boy a real girl soon

385
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
I prefer velvet

386
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
Interesting Lee they'll be a real boy

387
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Yeah

388
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Pinocchio is about

389
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Well your

390
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
You got a better

391
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
So alright alright if my theory is correct

392
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
I think that he

393
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Presenting this

394
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Like

395
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
The flip and now this article comes out

396
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,184
You can't possibly be talking about the actual guy who wrote the article

397
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Of course

398
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
Because I

399
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
I don't really have any idea who that guy is

400
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
I looked at his past I saw that he had a bunch of articles

401
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
But he's written that were critical of the alt-right

402
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
So doesn't seem like Alex should have any reason

403
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
But

404
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Gavin

405
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Vice

406
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Conspiracy

407
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
I'm listening

408
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Alex Jones

409
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Rex

410
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,040
That's why it's a huge betrayal

411
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
His son

412
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:24,416
Because he loves his son true

413
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
All of that is fabric

414
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
The backstory

415
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Play something the Alex

416
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Himself helped cook up

417
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
In order

418
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
Disseminate

419
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
Pro Alex

420
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Material

421
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
By the way of pretending to be anti

422
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
However

423
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
So now lyrics

424
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
Okay thanks giving dinner reveals all of this

425
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Text Alex G

426
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Thanksgiving

427
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:57,440
He loves Americana Thanksgiving is Amira

428
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,792
Araucana every night is thank you

429
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:07,680
Flying fruit

430
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,544
All I can think about is like someone directed me to

431
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
A picture of Alex Jones at Thanksgiving

432
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,712
Yeah and it's always liked him and his wife doing the okay symbol

433
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,552
Towards just trying to troll people with white nationalist

434
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,440
Ironic symbology

435
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,464
Sitting on the couch

436
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Looking

437
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
F****** uncomfortable

438
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
And it made me really sad all the baby really sad York every level

439
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
All of it made me so sad

440
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,728
First of all

441
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Might have been poorly time pick

442
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
You look bummed

443
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
And then

444
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Alex and his wife

445
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Just say Alex

446
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
Taking a family picture to try in

447
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Liberal

448
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Nothing

449
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Nothing says family and Thanksgiving more than go f*** yourself people I disagree with how you don't understand it like

450
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
I am very little family values

451
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,840
Like I don't really

452
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
But still that seems like

453
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Crafts

454
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,008
To me that's still using your family as though

455
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Yeah

456
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Crack

457
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:22,176
Co-opting what is ostensibly a family bringing together holiday for

458
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,784
Kraft commercial purposes

459
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
The point

460
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,976
Into the end of the real job

461
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,048
What's next play palak brambles a bit about

462
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Some cultural trend

463
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,352
He's not thrilled with

464
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Grab

465
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
I should say

466
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
You talkin about Roy Moore

467
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,784
He doesn't really doesn't really

468
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,160
Come out and explain a lot of the things you talking about but like side thought

469
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
And then they develop

470
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,072
Is Alex's narrative about Roy Moore is not sexually assault

471
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
A bunch of people

472
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,168
The miners

473
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:21,568
Various like sporting events looking for kids

474
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
What Alex believes

475
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
To be the case

476
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
Is that Roy Moore

477
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,480
Like a southern gentleman

478
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
Might do back in the day he is

479
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Parents if you can date their teenage daughter

480
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,952
Back when he was like 30

481
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Creepy

482
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:44,096
But he's not ready to say it's bad like you're creating a fake version of what happened

483
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
Hey Ben you're still not denouncing

484
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
You're still ambivalent about it

485
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
It's very weird

486
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
Anyway

487
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
That was the setup for what he's talkin about there

488
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,360
Okay let's get this correct

489
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
He is

490
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
Okay

491
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
A grown man

492
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Go to the parents of a

493
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
14 year old

494
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
And says

495
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Or or perhaps

496
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,608
Now my dearest

497
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Paris

498
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
Put on your Foghorn Leghorn

499
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Pull the trigger

500
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
Beautiful daughter

501
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:34,272
Great great job.

502
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
This isn't meant to be

503
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
A purely accurate

504
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
If he ask them

505
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Her father's blessing

506
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Ownership

507
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,680
Yeah then it is

508
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,896
But not much further

509
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
He is

510
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,712
Lying about the circumstances

511
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
To make Roy Moore look better

512
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
And no matter how still get too creepy

513
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
How low the bar is is that if you look

514
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Hey pedophiles

515
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,840
Attempted pedophile

516
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Do you know what he's talking

517
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
Grab

518
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Manchaca

519
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
Infowars.com

520
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
I love the

521
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
Rob do you nailed it

522
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
I don't know

523
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Kronos

524
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,440
You missed the punchline.

525
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Long time

526
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Weird

527
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,888
Alright so

528
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
Then recently had a national drag queen

529
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:37,408
Alex Jones video outside

530
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Got them selling baby

531
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:46,368
You'll say that I went and watched the video that Alex is talking about and their kids

532
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
Adult

533
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
That are holding up bills

534
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,256
While a drag performer is doing the routine

535
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,096
It doesn't even seem clear that the kids know what's going on they're kind of just like

536
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,240
Sexualizing them it's not it at all

537
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,312
Anything crazy even beyond that one of the things

538
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
That is great

539
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Is that you see

540
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
A bunch of

541
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,480
They're in the video that they have

542
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
There are kids

543
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
Who are offensively crossdressers

544
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,624
Who are doing routines with

545
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,744
People who are maybe on drag race roar like their Idols or are

546
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,608
Benevolent minor celebrity interactions for them

547
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,240
But you're also they have they're getting to have a really great experience

548
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,800
Under Armour

549
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,152
If they were sexually assaulted by

550
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,480
Gotcha

551
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,296
$0

552
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
A r

553
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
That is not a rebuttal

554
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
No it's not

555
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
What was

556
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,864
Wrong and I think that liberals no just like ya know he's evil but also you're evil too so that means

557
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
But it's not evil

558
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,240
No it's not it's not but that's his argument

559
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:11,104
His argument is like I'm not going to jump on Roy Moore and say it's fine

560
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
Although he has a weird it's anti-christian and the proof is that Christians won't let their daughters date until

561
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,344
Till they run away at 18

562
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,696
That's not a great like life pattern

563
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
Do you think it's bad to be anti-christian

564
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Even though

565
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
Christian music

566
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Debride Runaway

567
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
It's fine

568
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Does anti-christian

569
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,696
When women are subjugated sometimes they are give dollar bills to drag queens

570
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
It also Alex is going to mix this up and

571
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
That's just worthwhile

572
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
Makeup on you can scream a lot about dreams

573
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
People

574
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
The point that out ahead of time

575
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
Cuz it's going to get Marquee

576
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Hi

577
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
I'd already Murphy I'm not sure what it is he's trying to attack or defend I don't either I watch this

578
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
I was scrolling through the special reports trying to find

579
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Hoping it was

580
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
Interesting to cover

581
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
Yeah and I was like

582
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
This video is 11 hours long

583
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,680
That's too long so I clicked on it and I scrolled to like an hour 5

584
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Or something like that

585
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
First of all he has a goblet

586
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,104
Caboose

587
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Is rambling nonsense

588
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
11 hours

589
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Of Alex sitting there drunk

590
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
This is going to be amazing

591
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,184
Cut to just be repeating video of bacon pancakes mixed with New York by Alicia Keys

592
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,792
No it was just a upload glitch it's only like an hour and 10 minutes

593
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,816
So excited

594
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
11 hours

595
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:13,216
Make communion cakes making me so f***** up an hour 7

596
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
But it was not to be

597
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,592
I'm sorry this entire thing in like I don't really

598
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Exactly what is

599
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,480
Except Troy Moore is creepy but he's fine and vices

600
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Life is

601
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,624
Abandoned

602
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
If it's true I will.

603
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Where's the pretty frock

604
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
How old is wife compared to his

605
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,216
If you look at that she was 25 when he was

606
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
Are you making the Goddamn point

607
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,528
Yeah here's but they are also missing some facts

608
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
Go at different points in life is

609
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
Is totally fine

610
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
No big deal

611
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,744
But there are some indications

612
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,048
He may have met her when she was

613
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
And he was 20

614
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:18,240
So if that's the case then that age difference is very relevant

615
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,568
I think we did but like Alex

616
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,896
25 + 35

617
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,712
Doesn't have any knowledge of either the actual

618
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
Situation he doesn't know Anthony Samwise gamgee right over there to help him out

619
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:39,744
Not exactly right

620
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
F****** insane

621
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Alright

622
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
That is gross

623
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
Roy Moore is gross

624
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,616
And if you write anything nice about Roy Moore you are gross

625
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
If you say anything nice about Roy Moore

626
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
You're gross

627
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,504
Doesn't even include the pedophile ship

628
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
Yeah yeah yeah

629
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,392
It's very frustrating to me that this is not

630
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
It's still not enough you can win

631
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
Probably he's going to win

632
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
40 years too late

633
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
Harps on that hombre.

634
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,800
That's something that I've been sort of wrestling with this

635
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Is it going to be a downer

636
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
I think the Battle Is Lost

637
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
I think that at this point

638
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
All we can do

639
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
In some

640
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
Respect is prepare for today

641
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,416
Play cuz I don't do it the way that I see the people who could

642
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Help

643
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
Not helping

644
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
Yeah and I don't mean just Alex Jones

645
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
I mean

646
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Big pig

647
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
Picture a lot of it

648
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
I don't

649
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
I do not see

650
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Necessarily activism and

651
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,872
I hope I hope a lot of accept

652
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
But like

653
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
I don't necessarily see you away that meant

654
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Neutrality is going

655
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,320
Tubi

656
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
See how that's not going to happen

657
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Inside the stripping of the

658
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
Neutrality rules

659
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:16,256
And then when you have that you just coming through the internet is destroyed

660
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
When I was thinking along the way I hope there isn't going to be rolled back by

661
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
If they have any tax cuts

662
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
Yeah and that probably I think

663
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
I think there's a good chance

664
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
That they're going to get that.

665
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Point

666
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
When you adding

667
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,320
Here's the hero of the piece of it that I should have realized sooner

668
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
Together with

669
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Why the f***

670
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Did Donald Trump

671
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Immediately restart

672
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,792
Is 2020 election

673
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,632
Why did was one of the first things

674
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,400
Is he dead

675
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,216
I was install someone to oversee Alexa

676
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
It's because

677
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
They're not planning on

678
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,872
Running a fair game ever again

679
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,200
They're not planning on any of that and when you take away the net neutrality

680
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,552
You end up with a situation where all information is disseminated

681
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,320
That is

682
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,464
Exactly and then you will have the tax cuts that are going to destroy Healthcare

683
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Going to be scrambling

684
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
To live

685
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,096
That's right not to fix

686
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Society not to make

687
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
Active change in communities

688
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,008
Not to help the disenfranchised because they're disenfranchised themselves

689
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
That you're going to have a situation where I mean

690
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,688
I don't want to be alarmist about stuff but like modern-day feudalism

691
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Could be

692
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Tears away

693
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
Something like I'm here

694
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
I8

695
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
It's

696
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,440
Absurd to me how close we are right now

697
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,512
When you have a president like Donald Trump

698
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
You got nothing mean you got none

699
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
I've got nothing

700
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,568
You know Jen genuinely along the way over here I was thinking about

701
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
How it is that we could ask

702
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Something done

703
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
In the Democratic

704
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,480
Situation that they cannot

705
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
Is how angry everyone under the age of 35

706
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,904
Angry we all truly are they don't have any concept

707
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
Majority along that what we need is somebody to

708
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
For a minor office

709
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Like the house

710
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,656
Somebody to run for the house

711
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
And actually channel that rage

712
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Into a national

713
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
Every race now is no longer a local race

714
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
Is it is completely National

715
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
Because we all know at this point

716
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
That

717
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,296
We can't do anything local politics because National politics

718
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Has completely taken over

719
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
And even if you are in a state house

720
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Or something along those lines

721
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
The Republicans control those ledges

722
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Even then

723
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
The Deep the people in

724
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,632
In Congress are trying to defund those things

725
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
With this very text Bill

726
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,752
They are taking over every local race

727
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
And turning it into an Ashley

728
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,408
So we need somebody who is capable of channeling that Rage of young people

729
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
And actually turning it into an election win

730
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Because as much as they can

731
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Screw things over

732
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Young people are still a huge majority

733
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,440
To my my

734
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,512
My idea

735
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:34,912
I generally can't help the person who

736
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Channel that rage

737
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Alright

738
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,616
Starting new party

739
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,712
F*** that s*** party

740
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,296
That's what we have to start doing bro

741
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,344
Even if they have great voting record

742
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,232
Are not capable of doing what needs to happen which is to develop a national movement

743
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,536
I think that if a lot of Democrats

744
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
Stepped down or a lot of

745
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Babe just cleaned house

746
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
I think that would

747
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Maybe have some

748
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:14,336
Positive benefit for the younger folk like getting them on board

749
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,456
Weed legit to get rid of people who are 50 and older in government term limits baby

750
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,088
That can't happen anymore

751
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
We have some gloomy ideas about where everything's going

752
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
Anybody would like to help with my campaign

753
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Great

754
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
Let's do it

755
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,144
I'm going to do you know when the next race is

756
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
I can see it now

757
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,408
Are you on this December

758
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Sure

759
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,088
You have my support

760
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
The issue is that

761
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,952
That really is the only way

762
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
At this point I disagree

763
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
You don't think so

764
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
I think collapses

765
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
Alright well see that's where we might actually

766
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,032
If we can actually turn these protests

767
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Into a real

768
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
Political party

769
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
I think that makes a huge

770
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:26,272
Because

771
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Is making a big stink

772
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,576
And then nothing

773
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,720
Where is if we can turn all of if we can turn black lives matter into a political party

774
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
We're in a different world

775
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
If we can turn the women's March

776
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Into a party

777
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
We're in a different world

778
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
Just

779
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,448
We're just incapable of doing that

780
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,984
Maybe

781
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Still feel so helpless

782
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Due to the position that we've been putting

783
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Maybe I don't know

784
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:57,247
Let's get off this cuz otherwise we're going to be here all night this December

785
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:03,647
Three weeks after the votes have been so

786
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Mostly mad about the vice article

787
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,559
And so I wanted things that he doesn't like about anybody you ever reported

788
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
And Donald Trump

789
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
We don't use anonymous sources

790
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,263
And Alex in this next clip is sort of

791
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
Not understanding how that works

792
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
And really wrestling with the issue

793
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
News articles

794
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
Find me Frank Sinatra

795
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Frank Sinatra

796
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Hitters baseball

797
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Lucky chops

798
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Subway

799
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,055
Frank Sinatra

800
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,527
Avoid that lawsuit

801
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,543
I just got a source

802
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,663
You just switch the knife again

803
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
Thank you for

804
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
So

805
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
That was probably the most

806
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:44,511
Self-reflective he's ever been but while talking about other people

807
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,423
Yeah just want to disrupt and get attention exactly his

808
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,447
Business model

809
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,567
But then he said it like on his mirror he's got all of that written

810
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
And then on top

811
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
That a to-do list

812
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,503
And then he's like he pulls out his phone and he's like oh what's that buzz

813
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Reptoid

814
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
Hey like dude

815
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,463
Funny refuse the switchblade as a phone if he's doing some physical comedy would I be in on that

816
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Beat the thing is

817
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
Alex doesn't do that

818
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
But what he does do

819
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Is Pretender

820
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,495
He pretended is callers or high-level Source isn't it like that

821
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,615
Three high-level libertarian online people give him a call and say

822
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,687
Are you okay Rose groups are coming after you

823
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
What are Soros group

824
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
What are they

825
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
What's the score of screw their roving bands of soros's

826
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
And also they are

827
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
Enemies of the reptoids thesaurus is in the reptile

828
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,471
Source of the bad guy then cuz he's aligned with Mark Richard

829
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
An hour and trouble

830
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,431
No because the reptoids are the good one

831
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
And they're on BuzzFeed

832
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,319
Staff according to Alex's fake stores there the reptoids are fighting the Raptors

833
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,391
So in that case George Soros has to be erected

834
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
Okay he's good

835
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
I don't care anymore

836
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
So I mean he's he's talking about himself he's projecting

837
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,239
I'm into this about talk

838
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
People under globalist mind

839
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Control

840
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335
And I believe it is more project

841
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,527
They're just worldly and take they're angling and think like you're a sociopath

842
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,511
No no

843
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
No I'm not

844
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,863
Rebuttal

845
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
No I was

846
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Shut up

847
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,687
Current time station

848
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
A good thing

849
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,159
If it's emotion and it's what I'm feeling it must be real

850
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Pinterest

851
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:28,095
Jordan you're having a real intense with in the year did you ever hit yourself in the head with the mic

852
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
This one

853
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
This one was banana

854
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,263
Well he's doing even when he was like

855
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,799
I'll just do what I do

856
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
You're right

857
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
Literally

858
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
Word for word that is a perfect

859
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
I could not have described his job better

860
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
Look what I can do and then you're like no I was just giving you an example of what you say

861
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,583
He's at he just described

862
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,935
Sort of self perception of how he interacts with people is fastened

863
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,775
Like his idea that he goes up everywhere I look like I just want to build

864
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,759
Cupcake over and over again

865
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,575
Outlets instances of him just being abusive

866
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,599
People on the street

867
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
It's not about your words.

868
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,767
You just want to build what you meant was let's go bacon

869
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
Let's take a lovely cooking class I think we all should take a knife skills class

870
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,215
Cooking shows people get cut all the time

871
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
It's true

872
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
Is very important

873
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
Cupcakes with light

874
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Ridiculous

875
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
That's that I like when you're banging your head about it like him

876
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Just projecting like crazy

877
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:58,207
More prone to bang my head about that like idea that he polite

878
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
What's that really bothers me

879
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,303
I think it's just

880
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Cuz he's got the booze in it

881
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Accurate about what

882
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:14,591
I just can't deal with that level of projectile vaguely in your like a lot of

883
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
People who are filled with rage and stupid

884
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,807
He doesn't know what he's doing

885
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,647
I know I just it's too blatant

886
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
I like it at least drunk at least

887
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
How you doing

888
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Little bit

889
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
Drunk

890
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Trying

891
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:41,215
That's what I'm disappointed in Alex

892
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
You're better than

893
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Anyway

894
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639

Cyber Marathon

897
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:55,807
In this next clip they don't come to that conclusion but Alex and Rob do

898
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,439
That's not bad either they don't they don't land on that okay they trying workshopping

899
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Wheel of Vice

900
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:17,055

Yeah the camera on

905
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Which is a good

906
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,863
The camera on the picture that they used in the vice article and

907
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
Double chin

908
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
Is it ever mentioned that he has a double

909
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,031
No no he's just seen a picture of a

910
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Cell phone

911
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
I have a double chin

912
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,175
I mean when I read the article at that didn't even

913
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
13 Even

914
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Dawn on me

915
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,039
I looked

916
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,599
Very very Petty

917
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,439
Right he's a very vain man he's obsessed with it

918
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,231
Do the clip goes on and it comes up

919
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
More

920
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Oh my gosh

921
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
First annual Alex Jones

922
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,047
Stop time worshipping

923
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,263
Misrepresent

924
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
You got there

925
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Did he just

926
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,479
Okay that is that

927
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,503
What is that

928
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,319
Goddamnit that's

929
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,159
Set the title of what's her name's album

930
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Have to misrepresent toad Fiona Apple

931
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
I mean

932
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:31,455
Board certified projection but it's inaccurate

933
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Jackson the idea that like

934
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:36,575
If you want to get traffic all you have to do is s*** on me

935
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,975
The greatest biggest podcast in the world

936
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
But

937
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,119
They wrestle with

938
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,959
What do you think we're not misrepresent

939
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,031
Maybe we should be misrepresenting

940
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,967
We should do one episode where Reid is live

941
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:10,623
See what happens

942
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:17,023
Buffy did a musical episode

943
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,119
Like eight like actual Infowars

944
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Be drunk this is how we actually do an episode where we

945
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:31,103
Fish places you know how at the dollop occasionally though her

946
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:37,759
That's the way that we can do it that way I still don't have to know anything about allergy guidelines

947
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:44,159
I meant I'm interested in giving it a try fake Alex Jones Clips in my voice

948
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,047
I'll play them for you I will explain what's going on I like this this is not coming up

949
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
But before we do that

950
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
Alex got talk a little bit more about Roy Moore

951
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,223
Now they're real comedian talking about there is Aldi like brigading that they do with the like

952
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,063
Giving bad reviews to Amy Schumer stuff because they don't like her

953
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,439
And all the alt-right

954
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:23,839
Communities online that's what they do to make it look like

955
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,119
Nobody likes something

956
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
Cranston

957
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Consideration the actual product

958
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,359
As opposed to you guys trying to make it look like

959
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,687
Ghostbusters with women is the worst thing ever

960
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
We was good

961
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Yeah I agree

962
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:48,927
I could do with a little less mugging to the camera but with a little more

963
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,535
The little morzak there is no there's no large enough amount of Zach

964
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:59,167
Backwoods Pecan Valley character and his evolving backstory

965
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Delightful

966
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
Shutdown

967
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,783
Alex Jones

968
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
Pivoted on a dime there

969
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Sitting at his desk

970
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:29,887
Scrolling through stuff right he's drunk and he's just looking at the internet

971
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,727
There's something about

972
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,079
It doesn't

973
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,407
He is worried about it at the other as well as well as everything else turns out

974
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:46,015
There's an article that talking about how him and Shepard ambellas

975
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,647
Did Defender Roy Moore off the show

976
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
So he's getting defense

977
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
He's a nice type of

978
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
The shambler

979
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,727
Jobs

980
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
Break

981
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Charleston

982
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:17,503
We are literally what you're doing right now

983
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,135
Yeah

984
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:27,743
Which President is the reality that the early charges were told someone they were pretty

985
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,023
Is not

986
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Not at all

987
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,119
Even from day one that was not the case

988
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
The end of the world you get to live in

989
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
When your

990
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
Alex

991
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
Read headlines

992
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
And generally only look at

993
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
Media that is

994
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Full of s***

995
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
You can make stuff

996
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
Exact

997
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
It's a bummer

998
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
What is

999
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Alright

1000
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
Cuz at this point I quit that stuff

1001
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
Okay but here's my quick

1002
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
Quick interruption

1003
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
And I am sorry about the end

1004
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
I didn't have anywhere

1005
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Alright

1006
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Do you think

1007
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
He thinks he's in a bad spot with

1008
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,311
Okay so you genuinely think that right now he's like

1009
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,151
He's kind of scrambling to figure out how we're going to elect

1010
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:21,247
Worm his way through these all these landmines going around there

1011
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,295
And he's not sure if he can pull it off

1012
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
So he got drunk

1013
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:31,231
No I don't think

1014
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,327
Ahead of us

1015
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,887
Yeah I mean it's not a terrible idea

1016
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
It's like

1017
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,959
It's like not going to

1018
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Because

1019
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
If you don't try you can't fail

1020
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:48,127
Right right if we're drunk trying to do that you can just be like

1021
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:53,759
That's drunk Alex what are you going to do with that guy now and I'm sober more stuff in

1022
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,575
Episode has hasn't said the n-word

1023
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
What

1024
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:01,439
The Roy Moore stuff in this episode is accidental

1025
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,839
I think because this is just about trying to announce the marathon that they need to make a lot of money on

1026
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,679
This stuff is not stuff you means to talk about

1027
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,919
And it's so far removed from anything that they do let me give you the reality

1028
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,063
Who is drunk to the two of them are having some drinks

1029
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,135
You like this Marathon that we're going to do

1030
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,951
Do get the camera then that's what happened

1031
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
All the content is

1032
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
Drunk

1033
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,959
Ivar's whatever pops up is what they like

1034
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
I don't have the audio

1035
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,895
Awful but like there's a period of the show where he's just like

1036
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:58,527
Photos of automatic great report today made it plays like 20 seconds

1037
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,927
Powerful interview with Michael Savage

1038
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
The Alex Jones internet

1039
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
It's terrible

1040
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,559
It again

1041
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,863
It's just to promote the marathon

1042
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,911
But your question

1043
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,215
I do think he thinks he's in a bad place

1044
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:21,311
The Roy Moore narrative understand that like

1045
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,639
I'm over a pickle Barrel here because

1046
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:28,991
Come out pedophilia and I forgot

1047
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,319
Yes yet at the same time I'm coming out very hard

1048
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
Pedophilia

1049
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:38,463
The only way to really make this argument

1050
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,559
Whatever the only way I can make this argument is to

1051
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
You say that all the women were making the accusation

1052
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Exact

1053
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,191
In the same way that he does with Trump

1054
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,495
But the unfortunate thing about that

1055
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:55,103
Build a cottage industry out of Bill Clinton is a rapist t-shirt

1056
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,175
Right and how do you listen to Juanita broaddrick

1057
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,223
And stuff like that and so

1058
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
You got it

1059
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,599
I think you can pull it off if your allergy

1060
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,279
And you never let them realize that the two things are

1061
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,095
Inherently spiritually contradictory to each other

1062
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:20,703
When you're like no the women who are attacking Republicans are liars

1063
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,239
The women

1064
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:25,055
Are Puritans no driven women

1065
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,383
Need to defend them

1066
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
In the same way that like

1067
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,319
Liberals defend pedophiles across-the-board

1068
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
Comet Ping Pong

1069
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,695
Now and then

1070
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
My theory

1071
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,071
Disgraceful web genuine

1072
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,423
Especially with guys like Mitch McConnell even saying like

1073
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
I believe

1074
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
One I know Roy Moore

1075
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
He's gross

1076
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
That's all I needed to know

1077
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:03,455
I think one of the big things that is influencing Alex

1078
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Is

1079
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Normally I think

1080
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:10,367
If you would go straight after other line is politically-motivated it's all liberals

1081
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,927
So many women

1082
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,487
Have been coming out now not just

1083
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Anyone in particular but a

1084
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
Across-the-board

1085
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,887
Because of that there is an influencer

1086
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
That has happened which is wife

1087
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,471
Against their

1088
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
I guess their political

1089
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,335
Like Mitch McConnell his best move is to say

1090
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
I don't believe

1091
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:36,735
The same way the Alabama

1092
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Best moves

1093
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,599
The Alabama Republican to support who support right now

1094
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Realized

1095
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,903
Hey we can't

1096
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,999
Give a step we got a lock ranks even harder

1097
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:54,399
And not allow anybody through this war that's how we're going to get that now and then deal with the reality Leigh

1098
01:00:54,655 --> 01:01:00,799
Later if we have to

1099
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Of women

1100
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
And he's

1101
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
Can I be clear I don't take this

1102
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,735
I think that the reality is that there are very few politician

1103
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
That Alex Jones

1104
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
Has Don suck

1105
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
Such a load work

1106
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,159
In terms of branding

1107
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
As

1108
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,999
Trump style Trump Revolution politician

1109
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
He spent

1110
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Out like a month

1111
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Before the

1112
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,775
With Roy Moore

1113
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,359
He gets it like a f****** Roy Moore comes to things with

1114
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:39,455
Guns out

1115
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Alex

1116
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,295
I think Alex in order to turn on

1117
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,855
Would be a really f****** big deal

1118
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,159
Cuz he doesn't have there aren't a lot of

1119
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
Rump

1120
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
Agenda people who are actually

1121
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Inauthor

1122
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,559
Then why isn't he saying they're all liars

1123
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
He is

1124
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Most of it yeah

1125
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,287
Stuff that's not lie

1126
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,591
Is the idea that he went and asked

1127
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:09,151
Parents to date their teenage daughter

1128
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,991
Senior legal in Alabama

1129
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,831
Very gross but it's still illegal

1130
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:20,927
Alex says it all the other stuff all the assault all that stuff is why

1131
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,743
The only stuff that screw is

1132
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:29,119
Slightly creepy behavior I'm not for it I don't want my daughters being engaged in it

1133
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,959
But I get where it comes from it's a southern tradition

1134
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
That's

1135
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,407
Really difficult position

1136
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:46,271
Cuz some of it you can't say correct move is to say it

1137
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,599
Unconventional

1138
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:53,183
Alex likes to create an entirely robust picture

1139
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:59,839
You can't just do the most sensible thing all the time in believing a woman

1140
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,119
If you're on the right wing

1141
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:06,495
Do not do that you're going to get yourself in trouble leaving apparent woman

1142
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,055
I think that's more what he's doing is believing the dab

1143
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,103
It's not believe in a woman

1144
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,175
That might be even more to the point of what's going on

1145
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,503
That's a good point because the dad boo come out and say

1146
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
To date my daughter

1147
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:24,415
Daughter

1148
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,719
Like I said this is a marathon

1149
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,999
Commercial

1150
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,351
Anthony's next Club

1151
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,911
He doesn't do any address

1152
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:41,311
Yeah which is an ad for our add

1153
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,687
His professional wrestling level of

1154
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,271
Is kayfabe too

1155
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,855
But the next clip here he discusses some ideas that he has

1156
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
As for the marathon

1157
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,207
The first annual

1158
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,255
Vise appreciation

1159
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
Jayla

1160
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
We will invite

1161
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,455
Great

1162
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,647
You're great f****** man

1163
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
Martinis

1164
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
Big sombreros on

1165
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
He's allowed

1166
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,871
Listen to stern

1167
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:54,271
Really ever

1168
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,807
Do listen that's not what it shows like

1169
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,647
Any more anybody

1170
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,463
Howard Stern knows that his entire career

1171
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
Was fighting

1172
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:10,143
It was all being censored and him fighting against people censoring him

1173
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
Extant

1174
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:14,495
The use of little people and stuff like that

1175
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
Was

1176
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Make a point

1177
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,455
I don't know if I don't know if I'm going to give him all that credit

1178
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,295
But there is a rebellion for Rebellion

1179
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,855
In terms of defining the lines of free speech

1180
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
Shrek Alex

1181
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,439
If you wrestled with that a little bit would die

1182
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:38,047
I don't f****** step to Howard Stern when you're trying to make your dumbass jokes

1183
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,631
In your ad commercial for a commercial

1184
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,679
I don't understand how having

1185
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,495
People in sombreros Little People in some browsers

1186
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Just losing the thread

1187
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:55,199
Yeah he is he's just he's just mad living poorly now

1188
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,527
Going back to the drag queen

1189
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,695
I brought that up earlier so it didn't come as a side free unhappy with that

1190
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,487
Alex

1191
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
Not good

1192
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
So unless you think

1193
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,679
But the idea of getting little people to come to the marathon was just a joke

1194
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
I want

1195
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
I'll have another track

1196
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
You just talked over him saying extravaganja

1197
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
You f******

1198
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
He's drunk Izakaya

1199
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
We should have it

1200
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
Can you get hired

1201
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,999
All the attacks

1202
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
Oh my God

1203
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,839
He's a patriot he's Pro pre-market

1204
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
He's on Howard Stern

1205
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
The first annual

1206
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,919
First of all

1207
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
But

1208
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
If there's any

1209
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,015
Very large part of me

1210
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,319
He wakes up

1211
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
It's not like super hungover

1212
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
I like that was a good idea

1213
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
Let's do it

1214
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
He probably

1215
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,535
I've been robbed

1216
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,071
Who we don't know for sure is this

1217
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
Buckley is like

1218
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
I think it's a great idea

1219
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
But

1220
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,263
I don't think we should follow through with it yet

1221
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,847
Give me more years would weep subjugated

1222
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,687
And the thing is like

1223
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,503
The only reason that I have an interest in him actually

1224
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Trying this

1225
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Just like

1226
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,391
He does not have the grace of a Howard Stern

1227
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
So just be a

1228
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
WeedMaps

1229
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,047
Trying to use exploitation as a performance piece

1230
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:49,887
Or whatever it was

1231
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Hey buddy

1232
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:57,311
No it would probably agree

1233
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Spectacle

1234
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
Like it would be

1235
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,687
It would be a serious misstep

1236
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
It would be comical

1237
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:10,111
Which is where we're really turning I love I'm starting to turn

1238
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
Really hard toward this is now

1239
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
Hilarious

1240
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
We have to

1241
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,583
Acting directors of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

1242
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
And that is a

1243
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,143
Actively hilarious

1244
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
It's awful it's stupid

1245
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,495
But I'll be god-damned popes

1246
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,543
2017

1247
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Isn't really funny

1248
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,639
Pretty crazy

1249
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
Alex said the special

1250
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
Is obviously him

1251
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,807
Yeah that's obviously him giving up the game

1252
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,391
A little bit but he tries to save it you're immediately after

1253
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
Should we

1254
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,511
Liberals are

1255
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
Olympics

1256
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
You don't get coffee from your head

1257
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,263
You don't get beat up like that

1258
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
By the way

1259
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,847
Media Matters

1260
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
Jihad Christmas

1261
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,927
I forgot about that

1262
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,047
He's going to get into it all

1263
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Here's Alex Jones

1264
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,263
Alex Jones is transgender people

1265
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,311
Are usually super ugly

1266
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
Why the average American Airlines

1267
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,991
Good myself I just have a grandson

1268
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,039
The Cowardly Dog

1269
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,415
Yeah I like how Rob do is playing the salacious

1270
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:52,511
Scrum character right now

1271
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:57,887
Yeah a little bit play a little bit more towards the end

1272
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
Swig's or something refilling his drink

1273
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,943
Maybe doing coke make noise

1274
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
You know

1275
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,135
The issues with free speech

1276
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Yes

1277
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
What about

1278
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
I don't think we have

1279
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
Go

1280
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Alex

1281
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,607
His continued existence is a

1282
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
Demonstration of free speech

1283
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
And action

1284
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,215
Right

1285
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,031
People who may or may not have been plant

1286
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,615
Throwing coffee at you when you antagonize them on the street

1287
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,175
That's not your free speech being in

1288
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
Encroached upon

1289
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,551
Media Matters writing articles that again or toothless's f***

1290
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,343
That's not your free speech being an

1291
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
Encroach upon

1292
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
That's just

1293
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,207
People responding to you appropriately

1294
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,279
And let's be clear that inappropriately

1295
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,095
Media Matters did write an article about this and it is

1296
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,911
Worst things about trans people in the past

1297
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:09,311
For sure we've discussed a good bit of it but I think it was the same day or the day

1298
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
Right around there

1299
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,895
That he had that South Africa

1300
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Apartheid

1301
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Proponent

1302
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
They didn't have an article about how we had one of these Swede Landers on just lying about white genocide

1303
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
So

1304
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
This is why

1305
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Well that's not going to get the liberal

1306
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,839
Twittersphere up in arms man

1307
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,959
That's in South Africa

1308
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
Huge issue

1309
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:43,103
When I when I start had a little breakdown earlier was saying that I don't think we have

1310
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Chance

1311
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,151
I mean it's stuff like that

1312
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
Just Like You cover these

1313
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,735
These things which I'm not saying

1314
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
You shouldn't cover

1315
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,063
What is about trans people you should

1316
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
But you also need

1317
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,647
To pay attention to

1318
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,951
Him saying that

1319
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,279
Charles Manson

1320
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,607
Advocating for a white coming around

1321
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,471
Advocating for a white nationalist group in South Africa that's spreading lies

1322
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
In alright communities

1323
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
You're in America

1324
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
So

1325
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
We're antifa

1326
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Which

1327
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Celebrity goddess should

1328
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Who's the Sharon Tate of our day

1329
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,647
I don't want to kill anybody so

1330
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,439
I don't want to answer this

1331
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:36,351
I refuse to play a game come on I wasn't a suggesting that we actually kill somebody World by the media

1332
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:40,447
Delray

1333
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
Because

1334
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:47,871
You think you love Lana Del Rey but also a Charles Manson probably loved

1335
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:52,735
No no I'm worried about you but see Lana Del Rey is the only way we can truly love something

1336
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Thing is if we kill it and it's

1337
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,807
Well Lana Del Rey might be past

1338
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,695
I do not like the last album as much

1339
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:08,095
She's not pasture Prime

1340
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:13,983
Do you know these blogs online pretend that she's an Illuminati princess

1341
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,847
The only reason this doesn't work out now she seems a lot happier now

1342
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
Where is enter first couple albums it was all like I want to die

1343
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:30,111
A little bit baroque-style that's

1344
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:30,879
Does not work

1345
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,159
Unless you're kind of like

1346
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
Unless you're bummed

1347
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:38,559
You need to be flat and bummed out uplifting songs

1348
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
No

1349
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Not happening

1350
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,639
Odd matters covers their coverage is incomplete

1351
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,991
That is exactly what we got to do with the what celebrity would you kill if you were at

1352
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,855
Charles Manson was your Castle

1353
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:05,183
Has nightclub

1354
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,815
Great Alex gets back to the issues with the crossdressers

1355
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Yes

1356
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,423
Splits hairs a little bit about being a

1357
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Complete

1358
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
And then

1359
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
Put Gavin McInnes as business

1360
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,487
What if I want to

1361
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,679
So first of all

1362
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:53,311
Already were indicted did you notice those appropriate language

1363
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
He's talking about him

1364
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
Self but not when he's talking about other people

1365
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,783
He uses slurs when he's describing actual train

1366
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,343
That's a subconscious tell

1367
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
For he knows exactly what people

1368
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,327
Purposely doing it to put them down or maybe in his mind he's doing it to rile up live

1369
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,399
Maybe that's what he thinks he's doing

1370
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,447
He's revealing that he's

1371
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Filled with all of these

1372
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:25,567
Or attention is more important to him than other people's

1373
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,615
Felix that's

1374
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
Everything probably

1375
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,903
No matter what I say or what I do

1376
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,751
Geology

1377
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,871
What about the gay stuff

1378
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,439
That one place

1379
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,511
Technoguard

1380
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
It's just crazy

1381
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,703
What were you when we get here is what's crazy

1382
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
Not sure

1383
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:33,407
Picking up women at gay parties maybe I don't know but like what he's doing is basically

1384
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:39,807
Do you know the government has a failed stand up comedian

1385
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
But like

1386
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:45,951
He at the way Alex says it and this is obviously with Gavin told him

1387
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,535
Is it he got kicked out of stand-up because he was libertarian

1388
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,655
Kicked out by the HR Department of Commerce

1389
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,751
We got together and had a comedian

1390
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,847
Notoriously Collective groups if you'd like Survivor when you're happy

1391
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Take out that way

1392
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:14,111
Probably was at

1393
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,415
In college he met his wife you would probably at

1394
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,207
Some sort of liberal party because

1395
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,231
Is

1396
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
What he was when he was younger

1397
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,423
And so now he was up

1398
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,799
He presents that history of that that piece of his life

1399
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
Probably just a hack

1400
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,895
Comedic products that idea like

1401
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,431
Go to gay party to pick up chicks

1402
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,247
The old wild women

1403
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,855
Just repeating, Diaz

1404
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,671
That's what they called themselves as

1405
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
The classic comic move like

1406
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,255
I can get away with

1407
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:58,655
But I don't have to take responsibility why can't I say these words

1408
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,447
Richard's territory

1409
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,287
That's one of the ways that you can

1410
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,103
You can tell a failed stand up comedian

1411
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,895
If they're on right-wing radio

1412
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:15,295
Yeah that's pretty much I guess metallic might have wanted to do it

1413
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
Doug Stanhope

1414
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:21,695
I'm not sure if that's the point the finger

1415
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
But

1416
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,703
Because I kept saying these words I just wanted to say

1417
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,031
Watch that Michael Richards

1418
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,383
If you take the offensiveness out of it

1419
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
Really pretty fun

1420
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:51,903
What is not reasonable

1421
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,439
Look at it as a human experience

1422
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
And like

1423
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,767
Just look at like he is

1424
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
Blank slate

1425
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
He's opaque

1426
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,887
You can see into his brain

1427
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:02,911
Do you like

1428
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
Oh no

1429
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,007
Yeah that's trying to say

1430
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:11,103
The dynamic of like the host has to come up after

1431
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,431
Is the comedian you forget about that stuff like

1432
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:21,599
Tom Dreesen was hosting that show and had to come up after

1433
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:25,695
When something goes wrong

1434
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,255
Never never to that level but

1435
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,047
I'm what I'm saying is

1436
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
I bet that probably wasn't too hard to get out of actually I think everybody at the end

1437
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,519
I think so

1438
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,567
Did the show I'm pretty sure

1439
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,615
I don't know idea though

1440
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:50,015
What you want to be the man I think I could get out of that

1441
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:54,879
Next Comic-Con that case

1442
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
Here's a new game show

1443
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:02,303
How quickly do I get out of the sweet like it's like Name That Tune

1444
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:08,703
I can get out of this mess

1445
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
Get out of this mess in a bit of crowd work and one bit you have you have a comedy show that's going on on a sounds

1446
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,760
The audience doesn't know they're part of his can I get out of it show have a regular comedy show that's going on

1447
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
For most of the show

1448
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:29,952
There is a negotiation of I can get out of this in 4 minutes I just got out of

1449
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,840
Get out of the truck

1450
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,144
The comic was onstage just something

1451
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
Super f***** up whatever it is

1452
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:46,080
Maybe Moon's the audience automatic

1453
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,712
You got to get out of

1454
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,768
That's a good idea

1455
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:09,376
What was the other show we came up there was brilliant

1456
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
Deal or No Deal

1457
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,776
That's true

1458
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
New podcast

1459
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,432
Drive me crazy

1460
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
You get out of it

1461
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,344
Get out of this mess

1462
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,184
Endlessly watchable

1463
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,232
So this next Cliff Alex

1464
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,304
Does not get out of it

1465
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:39,840
Not good

1466
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Permission

1467
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:05,440
Wrong word

1468
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,264
The people act

1469
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
No one is

1470
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:49,984
Dan is reading all of his responsibilities

1471
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
I don't think that's bad

1472
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,248
It also is not

1473
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,040
Real that's not within the video

1474
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:07,136
There's no glittery dicks flying around to be kids

1475
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:14,816
There's not a big official

1476
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,400
Evening and over drag shows

1477
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,544
And they conveniently went and took video of the daytime

1478
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,592
Workshop types.for meet-and-greet

1479
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,616
Statue

1480
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:30,176
Pretended that it was part of a

1481
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,480
It's just I mean it's it's a ship game

1482
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,760
Bye.

1483
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,600
Again just beat you can't talk about Roy Moore without

1484
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,208
Jumping off the issue I love rubbed coming in and Alex

1485
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
Not prepared to deal with

1486
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:49,888
You know what he never actually said that and now it could be like

1487
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:53,216
Does not rescue

1488
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,592
Knox

1489
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
Going to have to

1490
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,200
What do you say about that

1491
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,272
I actually think that is creepy

1492
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,320
But I can't say that

1493
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,136
Better pivot to drag queen

1494
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
My audience of love that

1495
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,464
This Mech

1496
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232
Clip

1497
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,584
It starts with energy definitely when you get out of this

1498
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:26,240
Deeper into it

1499
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:32,640
I don't know can you get out of it like a borderless

1500
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
Think your way out of a stand-up

1501
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Mass

1502
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,992
By confusing the audience

1503
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:42,624
Cuz if so then I would be like I can't leave the show otherwise I'm not sure

1504
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,440
This starts with these drinking booze

1505
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,536
The end of this clip is just labeled

1506
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,584
I don't know I don't remember why

1507
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
I guess you could say I'm

1508
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
Americana

1509
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,000
I don't support suicide

1510
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
You want to kill yourself

1511
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,656
I don't want

1512
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
George Bush

1513
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344
Agree

1514
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,648
We have finally come to agreement

1515
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,144
It is okay bro Mark commits suicide

1516
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
I didn't edit that

1517
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:04,800
No like that's just him his brain straight

1518
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,104
Because I am not going to say it

1519
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
I struggle with suicidal

1520
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:17,600
But he just jumps to that really had

1521
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:26,048
I'm drinking red wine I love the red lady

1522
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,424
Suicide Vine but not forcing people to have suicide Liberals are the fascists

1523
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,728
F****** Roy Moore

1524
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
Little bit of a pause

1525
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,872
GameStop

1526
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
And so here's where we go from there

1527
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,224
This is this is my territory

1528
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,016
Him and his own

1529
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,576
Super southernway

1530
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
Older men were looking

1531
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,584
You took care of her but

1532
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
City Rollin

1533
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
My dad

1534
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
Younger

1535
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,552
My first wife was four years older than me

1536
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,584
Could stop at any point

1537
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
.

1538
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:42,080
To his credit he doesn't elaborate like you'd kind of expect him to fall into a pit of his own making there with you

1539
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:47,200
I have been waiting for him to

1540
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,992
Hit the argument of like

1541
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,368
After puberty

1542
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,464
Look if you believe in evolution maybe you should

1543
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,536
Like that's what I've been waiting for the hammer to drop

1544
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:06,912
This whole time you don't believe in evolution

1545
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:13,312
You liberal Hypocrites think you believe in evolution well Evolution Theory web

1546
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,408
For that is the wrong clip

1547
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,944
This is a mess

1548
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,736
This is a continuation of the thoughts

1549
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,832
Say that for the rest of the clip I'm not

1550
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:32,000
CareCredit he doesn't like descend into a beautiful or anything like that

1551
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Straight Talk

1552
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,264
Transitions into this

1553
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,080
Judge Roy Moore

1554
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,432
It's all suspects

1555
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,456
They can go get

1556
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,632
Alex is drunk

1557
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:16,032
I need the computer might hit the spacebar and it started playing the flute

1558
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:22,944
That's so like you hear Michael Savage's voice kick and he just looks over the computer kind of scared

1559
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,976
But only because I found

1560
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,832
For children

1561
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,392
Celibate

1562
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,024
I digest I just always wonder what they're going to make up

1563
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,072
I do too I wonder

1564
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,192
I wonder what they're going to tell the truth about I wonder I like if you just told like

1565
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,728
No

1566
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,520
Headline

1567
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,824
A buck

1568
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,360
Alex Jones headline

1569
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,432
Creepy ramble about 35 to 40 year old women

1570
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,200
Hey

1571
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,528
Yeah I have probably sexually assaulted some younger women

1572
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,856
Almost but I like I'm old

1573
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:37,184
But let me tell you something I really want to sexually assault

1574
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,048
And all of you out there who should that sexually assault 35 to 40 cuz guess what

1575
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
Spot Suites

1576
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,632
He has more to say about older women

1577
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,680
I was 16 hours

1578
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,688
Spell stand-up comedian.

1579
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,736
You're not looking for the virgin

1580
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,856
Dingle B from

1581
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,280
And Rancho

1582
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
Live

1583
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,192
Who played

1584
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Beautiful

1585
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
So God almighty

1586
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,808
He leaves it into Islam's there but also just that that f****** lying the older women

1587
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:40,416
They're the ones who won

1588
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:46,816
Does argument actually hold water with Lana Del Rey

1589
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,680
Younger woman

1590
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,728
That's so cray

1591
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,640
Where his mind goes from there

1592
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
Today he talks a little bit more about his

1593
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,720
Alzheimer's

1594
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,288
Who is this

1595
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,456
Crochet

1596
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,528
Women

1597
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,048
That's weird

1598
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,656
That's very there's multiple weird things in that like 35 seconds

1599
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,472
You can't say that I'm not for women

1600
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
Because I

1601
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,568
Prefer the company of with

1602
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,360
Or there's women around me

1603
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:10,528
He claims to prefer the company of women

1604
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,552
Very true

1605
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:18,464
There's a decreasing number of women around him at Infowars I will say that from everything I I can tell

1606
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,536
Over the years there used to be a few of them

1607
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,096
There are fewer there's rainbow snatch

1608
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,656
Millie Weaver

1609
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,936
No that's one

1610
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,752
And she's not there all that much

1611
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,080
Busy being a failed committee

1612
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,408
Lee Ann McAdoo is basically just over Skype sometime

1613
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,200
Never really in studio

1614
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,248
Right only confuse Legolas by the way

1615
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:45,088
The only consistent woman I see there is

1616
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,416
Is Daria his Russian translator lady

1617
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,232
That's the only person that is there all the time

1618
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Interesting

1619
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,816
And she's just there to do Yakov Smirnoff jokes

1620
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,096
To Alex off air

1621
01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:01,984
In Russia global

1622
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,336
So I talked about for a little bit how I like

1623
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,872
His daughters

1624
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Croup cough

1625
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
And

1626
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
Whenever

1627
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,808
Spitfire bedside

1628
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,856
No I tell them to suck it up

1629
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
Congratulations

1630
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,208
You are raising your children differently based on gender

1631
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,816
That's arbitrary you're probably going to give your kids

1632
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,656
Joy

1633
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
Okay

1634
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
He thinks

1635
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
Little lot of his fear of Islam

1636
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
Is based around

1637
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,688
Yeah right

1638
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,272
Why isn't he more afraid of Roy Moore

1639
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,672
Alabama Roy Moore is closer than wahhabi it's Islam

1640
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:56,768
Claymores in Alabama alexand Texas and Islam is everywhere

1641
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
It's at the pool store

1642
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,704
That's true it is at the pool store that's that's the perception that he has

1643
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,728
Scared all the time

1644
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,776
Anybody who's not white

1645
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,312
It could be an enemy

1646
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,104
That's not good

1647
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,408
No it's very bad

1648
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:16,224
Very very bad

1649
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,296
Now it's bad thing it's called

1650
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:22,624
Prejudice

1651
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:26,976
Family raising strategy

1652
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,792
He says this

1653
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
Buried

1654
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,472
And try to get the kids separate

1655
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,752
From the parents

1656
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,592
Kids go upstairs and play their Xbox

1657
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,088
The kids are hanging out with us

1658
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
It's not less

1659
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,704
Under the groove this point the ender portal good counterexample is

1660
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,496
Weeknight making a video with him

1661
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:17,152
I don't know where your kids are in this equation

1662
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:23,296
Probably drunk without commercial for commercial

1663
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,576
I don't

1664
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Get

1665
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
Like I

1666
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,184
Do they just think it's him

1667
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,720
Possible for

1668
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:34,560
People they disagree with to share similar values

1669
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,680
I don't think there's any hardcore liberal parent that I can

1670
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,216
Could be like

1671
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
No

1672
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:48,896
Togetherness with our children we're not worried about our kids at all but they have to say that

1673
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,712
Otherwise they don't get to take ownership of any kind of

1674
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:58,112
Family Values

1675
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
Abundantly

1676
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
Clear

1677
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,976
Alex Jones and Rob Duarte

1678
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,792
Incredibly privileged people they have a lot of money

1679
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,888
This pill scam they're running and have been for years

1680
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,912
So

1681
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,448
A lot of times

1682
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,264
Families that don't have a lot of togetherness

1683
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:21,664
Probably a single parent working two jobs is often that or or even

1684
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,712
Two parents in the household

1685
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:30,112
Earbuds working exactly is incredibly difficult

1686
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,160
Judging a lot of it comes down to like

1687
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,560
Their rejection of white privilege and male privilege and that sort of stuff is

1688
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:42,400
It's not understandable but it comes from

1689
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:47,776
There's a pride and ego that comes into it that they can't accept those things

1690
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,824
This is just clear blind

1691
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:53,152
This is just clear I don't care about other people's real

1692
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
And

1693
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
Why doesn't

1694
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,016
It is also a

1695
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:02,368
Complete rejection of the idea that

1696
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
It could have shaken out any other way

1697
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,208
Like their lives

1698
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:10,048
Yeah they don't have possibly understand that they themselves

1699
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,864
Could have been born to somebody in a different situation

1700
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,168
And have had fewer opportunities

1701
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,472
Opportunity

1702
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:23,872
And I've been stuck in that situation and have had to deal with a separate reality Alex Mount 100%

1703
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,640
I would have been in prison

1704
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
If his dad wasn't a retentive

1705
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
And able to move him around

1706
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,720
Don't doubt that for a second

1707
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,560
Yeah but I have almost no doubt

1708
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,168
Fun cuz Ian Rob do get too drunk and talk about other

1709
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
People's lives

1710
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,496
Implicitly judge them like a bunch of dick hole

1711
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,800
But they are doing this live

1712
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,360
Periodically checking

1713
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
The comments

1714
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,664
Interesting comment

1715
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,688
Comes in

1716
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
No

1717
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,232
I don't

1718
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,216
I'm dead certain of it

1719
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
It might be a glass of wine

1720
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,200
But I bet you were drinking at the office

1721
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,760
We've seen so many instances of him like

1722
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,784
Whatever

1723
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,856
There was that one marathon where he got done with his show

1724
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,160
And then they had the robin Owen show

1725
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,696
Before the War Room

1726
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
Existed

1727
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
They came on right after him

1728
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,840
And not an hour after he got off his show

1729
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:51,424
He barged into their show and started yelling at them

1730
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,752
I clearly drunk at like 6 in the afternoon

1731
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:59,872
So

1732
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,224
Hold his booze better

1733
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,784
Something along those lines

1734
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,064
That's not first drink

1735
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,392
His kids that's why Rob doing so good at it

1736
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,696
Yeah and that's why it's kids go to bed so early

1737
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:20,096
Alex is just pretending that YouTube

1738
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,144
Demonetized liberal channels

1739
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:27,520
Do you like didn't you see this coming when it happened to us

1740
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,080
Yeah he wants to be the

1741
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:36,480
First group in the I didn't speak up when they came for a ride

1742
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:40,320
Open demonetizing all sorts of

1743
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
No it's you too

1744
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:45,696
Yeah they're demonetizing liberal channels

1745
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,720
Didn't you know that

1746
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:53,120
That's why is that how they paid for the iTunes album that that downloaded directly to your phone

1747
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
That is

1748
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,424
Is a scam

1749
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,448
Get it

1750
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:02,080
I don't know why people are talking about it desperately about U2 song title to make a joke

1751
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,152
Two things I know about Bono

1752
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:05,920
Short

1753
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
Love stealing money from Liberal channels on you

1754
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,880
That's what you got

1755
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,416
You know what it is

1756
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,072
To making that joke streets had known as

1757
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,144
Not good

1758
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,008
Metal thing when liberal channels

1759
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
The exact

1760
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
Time frame.

1761
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,336
It's nonsense

1762
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,920
Little bit about the marathon here in this next clip

1763
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
Talking about

1764
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,400
And just see what happens

1765
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,448
Hookah 24 hours

1766
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,992
Is a piece of s***

1767
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,792
20 + x

1768
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,608
Washington Post

1769
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,240
Shut down shut down

1770
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
No

1771
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,320
Monopoly

1772
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,880
None of that accurately

1773
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,904
Depict reality

1774
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,952
Also are any of them

1775
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,000
Like I haven't heard the narratives that he

1776
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
A Russian

1777
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,584
Asian from anybody but us

1778
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
Really

1779
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,680
Projecting

1780
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
Yeah

1781
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:11,104
I think it is just revealing that he is a Russian agent in the same way that he has revealed that already

1782
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,408
This way he's like

1783
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:17,504
No cuz they're saying that I'm a Russian agent because

1784
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,088
Terrible articles in the past

1785
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:27,744
There was that one recently in BuzzFeed about how you just copies RT article

1786
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,280
Goes in the past about how

1787
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,096
There are our investigations

1788
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,120
To the

1789
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:34,912
Patterns

1790
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,192
And stuff like that

1791
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:40,544
Sites like Breitbart

1792
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
Until there are

1793
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:48,480
It's no one is saying he's a Russian agent but people are saying that he's disseminating Russian talking points stuff like that

1794
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:52,064
Is a Russian propaganda of the Russian

1795
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,648
The conversation in those articles which he doesn't read

1796
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Does read headline

1797
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,488
The conversations of always been the investigation

1798
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,608
To figure out our hope to figure out if there's coordination

1799
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:08,448
The no one really knows that no one's making that accusation other than

1800
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
Probably

1801
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,752
Movies listening

1802
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,104
Forklift left

1803
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:22,016
Do you know about this but the right-wing internet is really a buzz and has been for a long

1804
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,320
About Joe Biden

1805
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,856
Groping children

1806
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
Do you know about this

1807
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,904
I did not know about

1808
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,464
There's a number of videos of Joe Biden

1809
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,256
Grab kids

1810
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:39,168
But not sexual way or anything like pictures being taken in the Oval Office

1811
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,752
I just want that is it is actually kind of upsetting you like grabbing

1812
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
Girls are

1813
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,056
Yeah

1814
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,336
I don't know

1815
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,640
I don't I don't know anything about this

1816
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,968
It made the baby slightly uncomfortable but at the same time

1817
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,552
There are people who don't know how they're touching

1818
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,600
It's not groping

1819
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,624
It's not like

1820
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,696
Imma get onto that blouse

1821
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,584
If it is the case

1822
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,632
Did these kids feel that way

1823
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,192
I am on their side

1824
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
Probably say something

1825
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,800
If if that is the case in these kids

1826
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:19,360
Feel like they are being assaulted or something like that

1827
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,688
Then by all means I'm not here to stand up for Joe

1828
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
I don't I don't care

1829
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,344
We're not playing team sports

1830
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,880
If your

1831
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,672
Look if you're out Franken

1832
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
Yeah

1833
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:36,512
You f****** did it hit the bricks

1834
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:40,608
But at the same time there is there are accusations

1835
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
That are made there are

1836
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
People who have

1837
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,984
Videos that they are being like oh look at him

1838
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,032
Look at it that sort of stuff

1839
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:51,360
Did Rob do decide to discuss

1840
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:53,152
But something's on YouTube where

1841
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:56,480
Gestation swatted Away Joe Biden's hands

1842
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,088
Like everything trying to imply

1843
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:04,928
But everyone knows he grouchy

1844
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:08,000
Was big enough to stand up to

1845
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
This one's mine

1846
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,048
Well

1847
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,352
Here I'll play this and then I'll explain what exit

1848
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,680
Sessions

1849
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,544
Classic

1850
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,160
Back

1851
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
Girl

1852
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:55,104
So you getting the creepy voice out really taken out

1853
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,992
Watching YouTube videos be like

1854
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:06,880
Skates

1855
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,160
Cuz they play it

1856
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,696
Abdu phone

1857
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:11,232
Riveting

1858
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,768
Riveting production value

1859
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,560
So they're actually watching

1860
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,888
Is there is a child who needs to be

1861
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,936
Not where she is

1862
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,984
Right now she needs to be

1863
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:25,824
A couple feet over to the side for pictures to be taken

1864
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,688
I'm Joe Biden is coming in to Usher her over to where the pictures need to be

1865
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:33,248
There there is no audio

1866
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,528
I would assume

1867
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,064
That he realizes

1868
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,112
That is

1869
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
Crouching behind her

1870
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,256
He is walking up to her

1871
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,816
And is blocks to where the picture is going to be taken

1872
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,352
The hand swatting

1873
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,400
Is absolutely not

1874
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:53,216
It's just a shame trying to straighten out or get

1875
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,752
Lint out of the girls hair

1876
01:47:55,264 --> 01:48:00,128
And how that's you know that's clear it's because he is basically stroking her hair

1877
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,968
And does so after Joe Biden has already walked away

1878
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,576
That raises the question

1879
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,368
If the girl I deleted her hair

1880
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:16,768
It's not like I do I know it's true waves I was happy

1881
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,048
Okay sorry

1882
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:22,400
I'm not immediately accusing Jeff sessions of being a pedophile in a creek

1883
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,472
You're not Mike cernovich

1884
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,824
I mean in that in that situation

1885
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:30,848
How can

1886
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
Can you really

1887
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,664
Misinterpret that

1888
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,200
So confident

1889
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:41,600
Like if you can see that you watched it you didn't watch it like this the Zapruder film

1890
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
You wash it one time and you were like

1891
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,976
Oh this is clearly what happened because they played at

1892
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:52,864
A clear indication for me as if he was

1893
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,656
To do another swap

1894
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,448
Which to me indicates

1895
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,216
Either

1896
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,752
Either

1897
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,568
Incredible presence of mind

1898
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
Where he's like

1899
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:06,944
I'm going to swap but it's a cover cuz I know people videotaping this

1900
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,992
I'm going to make do it again

1901
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,528
Which is not the case

1902
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:15,392
Anybody who's watching that who doesn't have a vested interest in trying to

1903
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,696
To create some sort of a narrative would say like

1904
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,232
Oh that's

1905
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,792
It doesn't actually did that

1906
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:24,096
He would be using that video to fundraise

1907
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,120
Absolutely

1908
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:31,520
Like that's exactly how that would go.

1909
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,848
Yeah I protected this child or something like that

1910
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,664
It's and it's so quick I can't stress this enough

1911
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,992
The timing of the second wife

1912
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:46,368
Is after Joe Biden walked away friend pathetic propaganda and again

1913
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,952
There are other videos with like grabbing that girl's arm

1914
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,744
Pretty tightly it appears

1915
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,072
Make me uncomfortable

1916
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,096
Not defending

1917
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:01,984
The big picture I'm defending this I'm attacking Alex Jones is narrative

1918
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
Left

1919
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:05,568
See what they want to see you

1920
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Confident

1921
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:10,176
Yes like that's kind of interesting.

1922
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,712
Right that's true

1923
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:14,528
But

1924
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,344
I do not appreciate that at all

1925
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,184
The movie

1926
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Gross

1927
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,000
So I don't know

1928
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,024
Because

1929
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,560
Roast people

1930
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,632
Yep they like to dwell in in these things

1931
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:36,032
Narratives in the way Alex

1932
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,056
Launches

1933
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,104
Feet first into

1934
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:44,992
Whatever he does the like trapped in basement

1935
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,040
Yeah it's just

1936
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:50,112
What is gross

1937
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,000
The first is that it might

1938
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
Well the first

1939
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,560
Is the least

1940
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Reasonable

1941
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,376
And that is that there are

1942
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,168
Deep-seated

1943
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,704
Aggressive

1944
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,496
Galaxy sort of living out on

1945
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,544
On the show into that voice

1946
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,408
That's possible but it's less likely that that it's that and it's more likely

1947
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,688
But he realizes the

1948
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,736
The power of the fear of those things

1949
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,040
And he's just using it

1950
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,832
Like Wiz favorite weapon

1951
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,648
Yeah because it does evoke all sorts of

1952
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,000
Scared feeling specially about

1953
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:30,048
Did he brings up kids so often

1954
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,096
We have a natural urge

1955
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:35,424
Drive to protect children in so

1956
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:39,520
Really powerful people on your side

1957
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,056
Well it is it is

1958
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
Helen

1959
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:42,848
That

1960
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,896
He is so delighted

1961
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:47,456
Yeah the weird is it like

1962
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:55,392
He does not have any empathy for the victim and instead every time someone is victimized by

1963
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,672
What he perceives as

1964
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,440
Anime

1965
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:01,536
He takes Delight in describing all the things that

1966
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,840
You would be afraid of from this person

1967
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:10,240
He enjoys it when the people are victimized you could still argue I think that he's delighted

1968
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:14,336
By realizing how effectively it's going to move super male vitality

1969
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
Crass

1970
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:24,320
I also a complete lack of empathy

1971
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,856
Absolutely

1972
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:29,952
That's taking his red imply

1973
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
Anytime over here this

1974
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:37,888
Drunk commercial for a marathon commercial

1975
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,752
Wherein they accidentally say a bunch of really f***** up stuff about Royce

1976
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:49,152
Alex brambles about his wife and how he likes older women

1977
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:51,968
We just played this entire clip Evan

1978
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,344
Good luck

1979
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,136
Is constantly playing with that switchblade

1980
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,208
Yeah like it's 88 is a child

1981
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,768
It's a child behavior a child mine

1982
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,560
I got this toy

1983
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,840
Oh I don't

1984
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,632
I don't necessarily look

1985
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:15,520
For me to judge that what with all of my playing around with a panda and moving my

1986
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:21,920
Leg situation I've got to do all of this stuff

1987
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,712
I will buy weapons

1988
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,992
No it is not wet

1989
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272
It is not wet

1990
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:31,392
That's true

1991
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,512
Texas

1992
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
Great

1993
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,304
So

1994
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,632
I love it when you get a Rodger Stone tattoo

1995
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,752
I want up to Rodger

1996
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:56,992
They're going to double dare each other to do something of Rodger stones

1997
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:57,760
Back with

1998
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
Richard Nixon

1999
01:53:59,296 --> 01:53:59,808
Tattoo on

2000
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,624
Tattoo of Rodger Stones back

2001
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,184
Instead of a Nixon tattoo with Alex Jones

2002
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,976
Even repurposing

2003
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:13,376
Like I got a tattoo of you with the tattoo on your back

2004
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,168
It's like one of those

2005
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,960
Optical illusions

2006
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,496
Anyway

2007
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:22,592
It's been fun if you let your eyes go out of focus you see both Knicks

2008
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:23,360
And

2009
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,128

Alright

2030
