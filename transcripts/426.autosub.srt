1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody looks around

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Come to mine

8
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
I'm not one of these guys who likes to eat when I get to work in an office

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,528
Their birthday week

10
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,880
Set bring up my birthday and I have so many times on this podcast

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Over the course of from Friday to Monday that weekend the 24th through whatever

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Monday would have been

13
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Andy Daly put out his new album sweaters and then on Monday

14
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Beginning of his new podcast bananas for Bonanza started

15
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
One of the funniest people on the planet call being dropped on my plate over the weekend at the end of the weekend it was

16
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
Just fantastic. Really really really nice

17
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
I've been taking a lot of pleasure

18
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
That I got to catch up on

19
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,608
That I have you still haven't listened to another alert

20
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
I know I know it's going to be

21
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
I think Andy Daly is one of the absolute funniest people in

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
A f****** plan

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
You're a little bit by it being Tuesday as a recording that said you haven't listened to either of those things so

24
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,320
Hyatt priority and I had to get my birthday yet

25
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,928
I definitely have forgot what the other thing was and it'll come to me later hopefully but

26
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
If not it'll be on Friday

27
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,816
Tomorrow's going to be a god

28
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
Days have no meaning my bright spot

29
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
Is a personal growth

30
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
Hey I had to go back and take a look at some of the stuff and we have done and

31
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
I was agreeing or show nothing Adventures

32
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
Oh okay

33
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
Turn the hall lights lot of time for reflection

34
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,816
And I am proud to say I used to be a giant shitbag and now I am slightly less of a giant ship a

35
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
What is a bright spot in a little bit of time to recognize you know that

36
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,128
Talk about like you know you don't really see gradual things are happening

37
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
Booty look back it's like oh my God this is

38
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
There's a lot of difference between a couple years ago and now day-to-day am I feel like and nothing's really changed

39
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
You got to take a take a step back every now and again that's great but I would say in the past two years I've grown in

40
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
Changed more than I had you know from 3232

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
But from like 23 to 30

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
You're welcome

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,016
It's probably Fair probably fare very nice people

44
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Brilliant

45
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160

I promise you

51
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,431
Unheard-of levels of nonsense

52
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
I can't over-hype this stupid

53
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
And we will but before we get down to business on that we could take moment to say thank you somebody's wonderful people have signed up as part of the show and also

If he was a villain in Donkey Kong Country

59
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,695
Who is nothing like her namesake

60
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,047
Never thought I'd say that in my life

61
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Yeg

I'm a policy wonk contract expect dreams

64
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Somebody who donated on an elevated level and I got to say

65
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
Generosity above even what I am

66
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
We would classify in the technocratic are category

67
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,871
We got to go Raptor princess on this one

68
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Baby got to this on the last episode of every episode before that

69
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
But I can't find the Raptor princess sound effects all over the place and I can't find it

70
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,695
So thank you to this this individual this person

71
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
I've created a new Raptor princess soundrop

72
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,071
So thank you so much the armor of contempt

73
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
You are now or after princess

74
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Four Star

75
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Don't get mad and tell your brother

76
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
It's over for Humanity

77
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
You're Beautiful song

78
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
They're coming for your balls

79
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,895
Black piss all over your God

80
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Very few people

81
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
The practice of

82
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
When they are

83
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
Thank you so much the armor of God we preciate it I wanted to try and mix it up

84
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,703
So a lot of lot of non Alex voices there

85
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,335
Got a little scatological for awhile I did notice that trash yes but when I'm digging from like

86
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,687
More recent clip seems like Alex dark by pissing to a lot more lately

87
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
So thank you very much

88
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
Dot-com click the button says for sure we would appreciate it

89
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
Can go and find a local charity in your area

90
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
And help people in need that would also be wonderful

91
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
We would appreciate either

92
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
Yep so Jordan at 7 check in with the year the Seltzer up to 19 Seltzer's at the timer record

93
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
We are

94
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
Ahead of schedule on the 500

95
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
Black Market expensive

96
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
This might end up getting make people feel a little bit more comfortable.

97
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
Family members gave me Amazon gift cards for my birthday so a number of variety packs or available online

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
Do not use them on May 1st

99
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Do not cross the picket

100
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Amazon don't cross the picket line on May 1st

101
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
I will not do that for me the heads-up the other thing is that there's a bunch of grocery stores here in Chicago

102
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
And corner stores and a lot of them have

103
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
Lucy's

104
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
They have individual cans of Seltzer children often like between $0.60 or a dollar

105
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Find

106
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
Carnivals that I've been drinking and are still in the fridge

107
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,591
12 pack up yellow am I buy another 12 pack

108
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,943
This is not going to end up probably being

109
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Devastating

110
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
Right I've been you know going

111
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
To like to go get some groceries

112
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
I go through every aisle

113
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
You be surprised

114
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,279
There are beverages in more Isles than you think I realized

115
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
All over the place

116
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
So

117
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Today Jordan

118
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
What are highlights

119
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Well

120
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Can all be good

121
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,311
Sometimes you got to give a little

122
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
I got to say this is this

123
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
This week

124
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,527
So far has been a marked disappointment about 3 to bring

125
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
By Vai

126
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
They have a line of not all of them

127
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Have their watermelon lime and I gave it to 68

128
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,143
Okay I mean it's not like the line of them is trash

129
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
However

130
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,775
I did try the coconut lime

131
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
New Lowe's

132
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
4 rating system

133
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
16 out of 100

134
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
Damn if it's under 20 that means I didn't finish

135
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
If it's under 10 that means I find it repulsive and I wish it burn

136
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:10,047
I'm starting to realize that anything in like the 60s

137
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Is going to be just like

138
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Good but who gives a s*** right right he's going to be in a 70-80 that range to be like anything

139
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Over 80

140
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
XXL

141
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,895
I am anxiously awaiting the day we get over eight

142
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,527
Our overnight I don't know if it'll happen but I'm ready for it to happen

143
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,903
Well due respect by I know you can do some good stuff but that coconut lime with a

144
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
The disaster

145
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
And

146
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
We'll see

147
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,863
The bad flavor I'm going to take anything that has coconut is going to

148
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
I love the mountains

149
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,055
Sometimes I feel like I'm not one of these anti coconut guys looking man in a drink

150
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
Terrible haha terrible

151
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
So do I

152
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
To be a list on this episode

153
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Restarting here on the 27th April 27th Monday and starts out with Alex having a recorded message that he

154
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
He wants to send to the New World Order

155
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:16,095
Sirius my message to the New World Order

156
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,087
Darth Vader

157
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Nope

158
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Hopping around

159
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
You can destroy Alex Jones

160
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
Almost forgot his hair

161
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
You need to take

162
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,215
Do you love Alexa

163
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
I have a feeling that might be his recorded last

164
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
Episode

165
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
That's just

166
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
Like something to be played like in perpetuity the troops

167
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
What is on the tree of Liberty I'm afraid I'm going to forget how that quote goes in

168
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Just say that tyrants

169
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Lap up the blood

170
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
There's a harvest

171
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,287
Okay I kind of feel like that's his

172
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,895
His Salvo whatever I don't know otherwise it's just like a weird

173
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
Shoot promo about nothing

174
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Eagan do to text

175
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
That is you to take no no you can't

176
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Excuse me

177
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
He's getting any you getting out

178
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Actual content and Alex has a little bit of a narrative here this throughout both of the days

179
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,887
This show and it's just stupid

180
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,959
Just a desperate attempt to try and make it look like Trump is an idiot

181
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
Cedar Sinai

182
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Respected hospitals in the world's top five

183
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
Is doing light therapy and knocking out covid-19

184
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
Sneaking tube down into the lungs

185
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Fiber optics

186
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
Their Twitter has been banned

187
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
Cedar-Sinai Twitter pages still up

188
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
I just checked this morning

189
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Formation that is true

190
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
It's probably being misrepresented by right-wing outlets and those tweets maybe you're getting blocked

191
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
That's possible ones where they take

192
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,247
Sinai did Django like see you can use you right right inside and injected with you

193
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,831
That's where there is a little bit of Truth

194
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:55,231
It's also being super overblown by Alex

195
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Other than the babblings of an idiot

196
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,935
According to nurse.org there's some research going on at Cedar-Sinai that involves a technology called healight

197
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,567
Which delivers intermittent ultraviolet a light through an endotracheal catheter

198
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
It's being studied as a potential treatment for viruses and bacteria and it's showing some promise but it's not at the point where it could be used on P

199
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
People like Alex's suggest

200
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,903
He liked is not yet approved by the FDA for use or approved as a covid-19 treatment

201
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,255
And more studies on its using humans will be needed before it could be verified as effective

202
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,375
Researchers are working on this technology and they're following appropriate guidelines for that kind of thing

203
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
It's worth noting that they were working on this project

204
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,287
Since at least 2016 so it's not something that's being developed in response to the Coronavirus

205
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,127
Hit some research that somewhere in the middle of the process and we'll see where it goes from there

206
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
Alex wants you to think that they're getting banned from social media because that makes it appear that the globalists are totally losing control

207
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Bactroban is totally legitimate incredible Hospital

208
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
From social media because they're saying something good box the narrative

209
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
But none of that's real

210
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
So I imagine their statement

211
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,863
Would have been had they had they like been allowed to drop all the

212
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,775
God we wish we didn't have to deal with this to the president just said some b******* we're researching we're not it would

213
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,895
Why are you guys screaming at us don't use as we're anything we're just putting shipping B I don't know

214
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Talia

215
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Leave that leave without us

216
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
So Alex is going to lay it all out man

217
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
He's going to get down to just the bare bottom

218
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Is that

219
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
I don't know what to do

220
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
Play this out right now what is that it needs to be done

221
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Explain to the viewers and listeners

222
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
1 attacks so much

223
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,055
And the fact that he's for real upon this right strings

224
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Let me try to explain

225
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
For my own

226
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Hundred percent

227
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Documented Spectrum

228
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Right now

229
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
You know

230
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
You son of a b****

231
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Chris

232
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,151
Incredibly obvious and what they want and what they've done

233
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,967
This is pretty early in the show man

234
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,087
I knew I knew he wasn't going to but the

235
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
The timing still got

236
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
At the right time

237
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
It's

238
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
It's like a master what's the opposite of opposite of

239
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Goddamn

240
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
Broadcast

241
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
He does drop one little pieces eyes before he goes off

242
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
Fair

243
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
USA Today having to admit okay a true

244
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,463
Until they get to the park

245
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Those

246
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
Can you read 4 pages

247
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Hospitals get paid more patients listing

248
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Covid-19 on ventilator

249
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,823
Snopes says it's not true Snopes and Media Matters our God

250
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,175
Explain how it's reasonable for three more pages

251
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
That yes they get way more money

252
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
If somebody has covid-19

253
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Really funny when Alex says they make you read 4 Pages like I'm some kind of undue burden being put on his plate

254
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,303
Supposed to be this deeply competent researcher

255
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Four pages is nothing

256
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,191
Particularly when there's Nuance to the issue that takes couple paragraphs to explain

257
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
I can say pretty comfortably that Alex did not read those four page

258
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,127
The article on USA Today doesn't save its nope said that with this

259
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Point isn't

260
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
True

261
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
The only two points snopes is even mentioned using Snopes as a citation because they reported that a meme

262
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
About this issue was shared on social media in mid-april

263
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
And then later in the article Snopes comes up again in this line

264
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
Snopes investigated the claim finding it's plausible Medicare pays in the Range Jensen the guy was on Fox News talking about

265
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Mentioned

266
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,519
But doesn't have a one-size-fits-all payment to hospitals for covid-19 patient

267
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,103
So nowhere in the article doesn't say that's nope said this wasn't true

268
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
Alex is making that up because he wants to make it look like Snopes

269
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Who's lying in their fact check

270
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,807
This fact check is actually less detailed than others that I've read but it does cover the

271
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
Point which is explaining the part of this conspiracy theory is real

272
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,023
Hospital do get paid more by Medicare for patients who were treated by covid-19 covid-19

273
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,119
There's a 20% increase in payments that are dispensed by Medicare

274
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Which was established by the cares Act

275
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Act which Trump signed into law

276
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
The reason for the 20% bump is that hospitals are seeing a massive drop in revenues right now is people that other issues that might

277
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
I've sent them

278
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:07,295
To go get checked out they're delaying being seen or they're just toughing it out due to the virus

279
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
The increase of 20% is meant to offset the

280
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
The decrease is there seeing in normal operating funds

281
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Not aligned anyone's pocket

282
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
There's a

283
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
It's pretty clear in the USA Today

284
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:24,447
Hospitals and doctors do get paid more for Medicare patients to cover the cost of care and loss of business

285
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Resulting from a shift of focus

286
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
To treating covid-19

287
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
10 cases

288
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:34,687
At the end of that that that's so Alex would make it through very difficult

289
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
Can't expect that sort of effort

290
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Back-breaking

291
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Absolutely

292
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
Silence then goes to

293
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Rebroadcast

294
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
It's funny to me because what he's saying there is

295
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
They make you read 4 pages

296
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
To get to this part

297
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Is just basically saying like

298
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,239
They make me ignore all the context that proves the part wrong that I want to lie about God

299
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,823
Dammit yeah it doesn't matter anyway

300
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
Has noted that there's linked to this

301
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:11,039
Let's just admitting that all that context is to explain why he's wrong and so he can't get out

302
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
Broadcast Honey comes back

303
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
Andy said a rambling about how Trump listen

304
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,512
And everybody and you know

305
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
You good

306
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,656
You good you give him the right until when he's going to act

307
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,240
Trump didn't know that a Nobel Prize winner

308
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Oh God

309
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
Virologist in the world

310
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
Had the virus scan

311
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,832
Know that the top-end in University scanned it and said the same thing

312
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
3 months ago

313
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
F11

314
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Smart people are all scared

315
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
Because if you bring from prelim tell on who runs things

316
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
General Flynn

317
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424

321
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Know what's going on and I'll put Trump in

322
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Is this

323
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
Are we okay what's up

324
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488

00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,192
Second time saying I might not be back

358
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
That's a guy who's committed

359
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,592
So he leaves and comes back

360
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,152
Let's talk to you about the steaks

361
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,480
What's going on

362
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Advise the president

363
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Effacing

364
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Prison

365
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
General Flynn

366
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,184
Advisor present getting good advice he's facing prison

367
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
Play the present good advice I'm facing

368
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Right now okay

369
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
It'll be outside

370
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,704
Childish work at least people Target you and they let you know and they operate with impunity folks

371
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,008
Because the government is so full of

372
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
And social climbers

373
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
So I was wondering about this and I don't know of any crimes that Alex has committed outside of him

374
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
Bragging about murdering people

375
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
I don't think that's

376
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:27,808
True

377
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
There's no statute of limitation

378
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,744
No that's true but I don't think that's true

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
Monster

380
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
To think about this you know he has this lingering case with the bankruptcy issue because that his ex-wife is bringing

381
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,032
And who knows what's going to happen with that but I started to think about it

382
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,664
And I realized that one of the things that she's doing is she's asking for a lot of documents

383
00:25:53,920 --> 00:26:00,064
In terms of Discovery for the kids but I'm thinking

384
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Be what Alex is worried about is not necessarily

385
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,416
Losing that case I haven't

386
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,536
To pay her off right but the idea that a lot of his internal financial documents will become public

387
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
What is he's like hiding money somewhere what he is doing something criminal financially that's just you never know and

388
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,568
I don't know I don't know if that's true but I'm just trying to think of

389
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
What could he be worried about

390
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Business-related right I mean

391
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
I think I think

392
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
You should do is

393
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
In the in the Discover

394
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,600
Instead of sending any documents he just gives them Rob do

395
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
And just like

396
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
You ask him all the questions

397
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,976
That you want to know the answer this guy knows everything

398
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
How do I be a good

399
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
Stalling tactic

400
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,192
So I don't know

401
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Prison soon

402
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,616
I don't believe I'm going to God's true but if it is it's got to be something else

403
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
I don't believe he's murdered people

404
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,808
I don't I don't know of any other charges that are pending I mean you got the DUIs I go to prison for that

405
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,904
Maybe there's something related to that no

406
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
I don't think so

407
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
Natural but he's just making up the whole prison thing because it could be

408
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,424
He wants to try and compare themselves to Rodger Stone and in Flint

409
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,752
Really

410
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
So Alex gets against

411
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
Stalking some more and he's just not having a good day man

412
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Let me do this

413
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
The same report

414
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Oh no but I might do it right now

415
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,264
Does John

416
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:02,176
You know what they called it back when I was in high school to cause it to senioritis I was thinking that Eleanor last

417
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
He's dealing with right now he's like I know I'm

418
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
Yeah and I just don't know why I'm running hard to the finish line

419
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,304
I just saw some lightning thunderstorm on right now and I would like to be able to enjoy it a little bit of gas

420
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,192
A nice nice mood is a little bit of a dark and stormy

421
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,776
Thunderstorm when we have

422
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
When you have one Brewing

423
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
Sure

424
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,408
So Alex is going to go to this downtown report

425
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:39,296
Getting off are for the third time in an hour not handle this business

426
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:45,184
But just because he can't handle doing his job but that doesn't mean he can't self of course

427
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
I am grieving ever

428
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
Ms right now

429
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,192
Because I trust in God

430
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
And I do trust in God but

431
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
Look at how many truly evil people there are and it just

432
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,432
Blows my mind that our species until turned over to

433
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
You got a DUI bro

434
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,136
Because I've got to worry about the future and keeping us here on air Plus

435
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Products you really need

436
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,512
You're completely insane

437
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Goodnites

438
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Pretty severe talking then then these ads episode are just

439
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
F****** severe

440
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:35,360
The Fightin side of me wants to stay and play Stay on Aaron fight this and I don't think it's a lost cause yet but

441
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Personally making a lot of defensive measures

442
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Really

443
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,928
Understand the long dark

444
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:54,048
So damn sad that we had a chance furnace around we made it just be so weak

445
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Going to break lotion

446
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:59,168
Then at the very criminals that launched it will be our saviour's and then

447
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
I'm headed down injectors with bioweapons and laugh at us while we slowly die

448
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:08,384
But again infowarsstore.com horrible food now while you still can

449
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:13,760
Freezer Veer DanTDM

450
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,088
Mr. clean had that one adware chopped up babies and

451
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:21,184
This is the only way to clean up at Magic Eraser

452
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah man I mean it's pretty extreme language being used in service of trying to sell food buckets

453
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
Great

454
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:35,776
So the other thing the Run start this episode is a strong interest in prison

455
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Hunting Trump

456
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
As like

457
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Really the man of the people

458
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Like he loves

459
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
You

460
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,736
Just can't say for one second guys

461
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
We f***** up on this

462
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,344
We were Alex. We we thought we could go

463
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Controller

464
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
We thought we could do what he needed to do because there's so much Messianic stuff

465
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
But having visions about there's a how he's a psychic and all this s*** like

466
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:05,984
He can't be wrong about this because if he's wrong about it and all that stuff looks like total b******* too big to be wrong

467
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,592
Yeah he's too big for sale near me

468
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
And you know that involves doing a lot of dear leader s*** talking about how like and what he does

469
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Like this is

470
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
This is nonsensical

471
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
He gets briefings has a secret Ally

472
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,720
Wood box

473
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
What people hand them

474
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,280
He demands

475
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
On overseas flights

476
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
From d.c.

477
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
They cannot stand it

478
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,640
Can't stand the Trump as a secret service go around and get letters

479
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
From the commoners you at the rally made him read

480
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
4 pages are you sure by the way

481
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Adjusted.

482
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,512
Yeah but not Trump

483
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Flights

484
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
And he insisted

485
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,168
The mail the collect at the rallies and you sit there and them

486
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,264
If he can read I would be one I think he would need to use reading glasses

487
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
And he can

488
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
I don't think he can read

489
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Why would she really kind of don't think

490
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
I don't want to speculate on whether or not he's on

491
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
At the very least

492
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
Betrayal Penny Reid

493
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,464
You're not just on planes planes is he reading your letters

494
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,072
Don't joke with people is like I would watch that but I'd watch it on a plane

495
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,424
Stuck on the plane

496
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
It's not just on planes

497
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
Is like Superman

498
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,104
Bring him pallets of mail

499
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
From the warehouse down the road and then

500
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,784
And just just reads it

501
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Battlbox

502
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856

This is f***** up service

507
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
A secret

508
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,640
Could you leave us alone

509
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Please stop

510
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
Alex just leaving

511
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
Countdown

512
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,576
Yeah so try playing brides and then at night

Alex comes back

516
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
The break starts talkin about some bible stuff is really big into religion

517
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
Does say something here that makes me think I don't know if he knows much about the bike

518
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
Play bunco

519
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Jose say

520
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
46 I'm sorry what now

521
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
James Version

522
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,160
Destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou Hast rejected knowledge

523
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
I'm also

524
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,888
Analog. I will also forget thy children

525
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
For me it's not a power

526
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Everyday

527
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,080
Call Tina Peeples

528
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
Responsibility

529
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
I took a turn from the Bible verse okay

530
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:36,160
How old is Dick about this because honestly Alex's clothes on the pronunciation

531
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,976
He said the book of Jose but it's a book of Hosea

532
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,840
I know that's close but it's super far off for anyone with any familiarity with the Bible

533
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,192
I don't believe that anyone who's read the Bible or has been involved in any church with

534
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
With any regularity would not know how to pronounce the name

535
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Of the book Hosea

536
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
It's just unbelievable to me but someone with any real history with the Bible would encounter that word and take it might be Jose

537
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,808
This along with all the other things Alex does connection with the Bible

538
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
Actually be super

539
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,160
Maybe he appreciates Mexican people more than we thought

540
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
No I just don't think

541
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,072
I think he's completely unfamiliar with the the actual Bible

542
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
It's the little things like that just keep coming up of like

543
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
What are you doing

544
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
Oral tradition is what will

545
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
Bible verse God can change the

546
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
Bible but you can't change our words

547
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,920
It's okay

548
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Book of Hosea

549
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Whatever

550
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
So

551
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
Earlier in the show Alex freaking out a little bit you might have

552
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Mother noticed that

553
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
I did

554
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
He wasn't on the show

555
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
Right before he was on the show

556
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
Scrappy kind of explains why he was freaking out

557
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
It's because Trump

558
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,216
Relies on him for information

559
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Boy pictures on air

560
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
Able to go out and and and

561
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,920
I know because we're just so much

562
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,576
What I say today

563
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,352
This is actually a real president

564
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
Founded by criminals and he has to get information from me

565
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
And then I just

566
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
You should

567
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,064
Picking up what are you saying there

568
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Here's the way I'm interpreting that is more like much like the Bible it is open

569
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,000
The Constitution

570
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
What I hear is

571
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,048
If I say drink

572
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
People are going to think

573
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,288
Influencing Francais I drink bleach if I disagree with drinking bleach

574
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,152
I'm going to lose the support of all my wacko friends who would rather Trump drink Bleach then

575
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Anything else

576
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
So he's caught in a

577
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
Catch-22

578
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
I don't want people to drink bleach

579
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,136
But somehow that's a controversial thing to say in my world right

580
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:21,536
I have a slightly different I can't do my show

581
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Because of the immense

582
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,960
Pressure cuz I know Trump is getting his information from me and that's why I was freaking out earlier because I am not doing the

583
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:35,360
Good enough job because I know that Trump has a team listening to my show and whenever I say this is a message for the

584
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
President they cut it out and they give it to drop

585
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,552
This is the same thing with Steve pieczenik thinking the newspapers talking to him like honestly this is just

586
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Cuckoo

587
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,624
Cookie Shop

588
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
If

589
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,464
If it weren't for the fact that Trump said let's drink bleach

590
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,096
Just feel like nothing

591
00:37:56,352 --> 00:38:00,448
Feels more like the TV's talking to you than it ever has before I would imagine

592
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,240
Like if the president is saying

593
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,848
Wackos

594
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,664
With Alex he's not really on that tip

595
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,224
Sincerely I don't I don't hear APUSH drinking bleach

596
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Or the bleach people

597
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Maybe he's resentful

598
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Maybe

599
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Yeah because Alex hasn't even he's pretending they're all trouble saying the sunlight is good for you

600
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,792
Rebutting the part about injectable

601
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Sure sure

602
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
I don't know

603
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:34,240
I think it's all just a rationalization for why you left the show three times

604
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Earlier

605
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,616
He said the show went sideways

606
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
That I will say

607
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Fexofenadine

608
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
So Alex

609
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Gets Brill do me

610
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Bitesquad

611
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
Vans

612
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,344
He's just like well this is over

613
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Long after I'm settled in my grave

614
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
You can save this on a on a memory stick

615
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
So when they're killing you yet this out

616
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
There's still time to stop

617
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
Only in the future we lost this round

618
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
John Connor

619
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
We lost this round there's only we can only stop them in the future

620
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,784
That's pretty much it

621
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,088
Come with me if you want to die

622
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,672
Shorter

623
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
Time traveling what not do the 27th or isn't like a lot of really good stuff going on but trust

624
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
May it makes up for it

625
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Bucketful

626
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,216
Okay

627
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,104
But this is really really just like I was listening and most of the time on the 27th I just think

628
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,688
This clip is one of the times that I had that

629
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Response

630
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
Trump is not an idiot savant he's an idiot

631
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
But you guys have stuff online

632
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
Characteristics

633
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:04,864
Very quickly

634
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,264
But sometimes he seems disconnected

635
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,384
A person who is highly knowledgeable about one subject but knows little about anything else

636
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
So I would call him

637
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Siobhan

638
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
But it looks like when you're talking to Trump

639
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Jesus

640
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
He's probably the smartest person on the planet

641
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Wow

642
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
This is

643
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,752
Wow

644
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,848
You say he did some dear leader type gym leader

645
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,200
Probably the smartest person in the world I mean

646
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:56,064
He's our god king he has Infinite Wisdom

647
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
You know how like a idiot savants I know one thing he's like for everything

648
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,352
I have word that he's rude when he's being rude to people or maybe looks like he's not paying attention

649
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
It's just because he's so much smarter than the people around absolutely attention span of a

650
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Mouse it is because he is a genie

651
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Right

652
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,432
That's had that was upsetting

653
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,784
I can't imagine I can't imagine listening to myself say something like that

654
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,808
And then like

655
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
Survive again

656
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
That's cereal

657
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
Breaking news that he wants to get to and also I don't know if you still have your bingo card

658
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,888
Hard but we might find out that another movie is real

659
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Don't say it like that

660
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Play

661
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Or the bad guy

662
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,919
By the vaccines tainted he sells supplements

663
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Three causes the Earth to die

664
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,831
And you see that the lockdown cities and all the precursors in the conditioning

665
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,415
So not only is Contagion real it's about Alex

666
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
Greatschools

667
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
So you got this breaking news that's a juicy

668
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,631
I really didn't like him doing that that really bums me out you don't like hearing about the new juice

669
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
Astoria

670
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
USS will not take

671
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,543
Launch

672
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,847
Covid-19 in it

673
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,431
Rihanna's with contaminated death

674
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,247
Global initiative on Friday

675
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,087
Speedy development and distribution of drugs and vaccines covid-19

676
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
A spokesperson of the US mission in Geneva told Reuters Alex's editorializing pretty heavily when he was appearing

677
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
Tubi

678
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,679
Juicy I will know also the underlying story here is insanely bad

679
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:52,543
I was presenting it as dropping too smart to get caught up in this evil vaccine work

680
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,151
In reality would have demonstrates is a really scary level of isolation we're taking on

681
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Also this news didn't just break

682
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
The guardian reported on the story on April 24th for 3 days

683
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,855
Before the episode Alex is doing what he's calling this a break

684
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
Juicy piece of news

685
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:14,047
What happened is the global leaders got together on a video call and quote pledged accelerate cooperation on a coronavirus vaccine

686
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
But that's not all

687
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
It was also about sharing research

688
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
And as the guardian reported quote

689
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:25,823
The corporation pledge made it a virtual meeting was designed to show that wealthy countries will not keep the results of research

690
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
From developing country

691
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,455
Because Trump has shown such outright hostility to The Who

692
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,831
He couldn't take part in this meeting without giving an implied endorsement of them which he's too much of a baby to do

693
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:42,975
And so the supposed leader of the Free World the head of the world's great superpower turned his back on an international pledge

694
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:48,607
To make sure the developing world is not left behind because they can't afford to pursue the level of medical research that we can

695
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
F*** all this and f*** Alex for celebrating

696
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
This is

697
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,287
Stupid it is it is very much

698
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Mayonnaise

699
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
It's it's like

700
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,991
He's turning America into the s*** hole that he thinks other p

701
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
The other places are

702
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,367
In order to justify America

703
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,719
I am flabbergasted

704
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
There are no adults and we're all

705
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
We're all stupid

706
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
We're all just f******

707
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
Stupid

708
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
But if there's a Saving Grace

709
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
It's

710
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,287
Knowing that Alex has a zone are are clearly number

711
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,591
Based on how frequently

712
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Keep stalking

713
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Think about how this s***'s over

714
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
Pho that's a scientific

715
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
Satanic

716
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Go down to Gates

717
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
Personally

718
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
Talk to some Bear Hollow

719
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
Told them all of this just days ago

720
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,351
Over the phone now you can imagine what that do

721
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Write on me

722
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
That's a two-way street the target

723
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
You know that

724
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,103
It's okay

725
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,151
Very very soon

726
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Is this like The Running Man

727
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
What's that movie

728
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,191
Total Recall you plug into the Matrix in

729
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,007
Really it's all alucinacion

730
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
Cool Man Lego

731
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,151
Is very very soon as I get obliterated

732
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,831
Alaska April 27th

733
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,183
I think that this is real also interviewed Lord

734
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,743
So this is

735
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,047
Like this is a real real problem

736
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
Alex

737
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Medallia

738
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:00,703
You better choose a side pubs anglo-americans talisman

739
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Whoa

740
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
We raised right now

741
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:08,383
So that little line indicates to me a complete lack of awareness on out at 8 Alex of his own worldview

742
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
He doesn't know what he saying

743
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,575
What do you wants to say is that you're either with China or you're with his weird white supremacist Patriot buddies but he's using language as a

744
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,903
Very specific and very different meeting in the world of his conspiracy

745
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,975
What Alex's anglo-american established

746
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
He's not talking about the West

747
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
He cannot be

748
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,607
Because the foundation of his narratives about the globalist

749
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,959
Largely rest upon the foundation of misrepresentations of Carol Quigley's writer

750
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,335
Alex pretends that he's read Quigley's book tragedy and hope and in that book quickly admit

751
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,151
It's there's a group of people operate in secret to control the world

752
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
These are the round table group

753
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,015
Who control the Council on Foreign Relations the Royal Inn

754
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
Institute of international Affairs and countless other bodies

755
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:55,231
This group was set up by Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner and quickly very clearly refers to the collection of these groups as

756
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
The anglo-american established

757
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,655
That's literally the name of Quigley's previous book about roads and the influence he's had over the years

758
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:08,287
I've heard Alex use that term in relation to quickly many times it's shorthand for the Proto globalist

759
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,823
In the sphere of the Infowars

760
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,151
Conspiracy theory fuse to believe that Alex would ever use that expression 2

761
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,223
Denote something positive in opposition to the Chinese

762
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
Because it literally means globalists

763
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,599
You are either with the people I hate

764
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,903
Or you're with the people I hate

765
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
And I'm

766
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
On the side of

767
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Somebody

768
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:34,143
This isn't something that you could possibly slip up and say unless you have no idea what you're talkin about you speak

769
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,215
Mostly randomly and you don't have a good handle on your Source material

770
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,359
This would literally be like me saying you can either support Satan or you can support the infowar that's the situation wherein

771
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:50,015
I don't believe that this is a slip-up on Alex's part I think it's an indication that he really doesn't know what angle American establishment

772
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,647
I think it was grasping for Words any remember that he said those particular words before it sounded good

773
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,487
Unfortunately he happen to accidentally suggests that siding with the globalist

774
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Is a good idea

775
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
Cuz he doesn't know any

776
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Doesn't mean everything

777
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:06,399
He's just talking s*** I think it's fairly easy to say that

778
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,703
If he doesn't mean anglo-american

779
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:13,311
Establishment in the way that even his conspiracies suggest

780
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,127
What he really meant is you're either with white people are you with

781
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,479
Mommy more or less like I said that's what he's

782
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Pulling cord

783
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
That term means something

784
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Right

785
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,951
Restart the 28th holyshit

786
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
I cannot wait

787
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
To get to

788
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,791
The fun on this episode

789
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
Why we start where Alex starts

790
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,655
And that's him talking about how the end is near for him

791
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:45,055
That we're not dead yet in fact we're stronger than ever hitting the final stretch

792
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
Complete the operation

793
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
Just save the day

794
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:59,903
Just f****** say next time he might not exactly when he plans to shut things down

795
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,487
You know like a lot of people

796
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,279
There's a there's a chance

797
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
This is all just the address

798
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:11,679
Yeah but it's so consistent going on for a while now

799
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
And it just feels

800
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,775
It feels more

801
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,639
Real than other times he's he's done these modeling performances

802
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,431
I don't know I don't I don't know

803
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,783
We could be talking about him in a year and look back on this and feel like idiots that we were like

804
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,111
Oh man he will not feel like an idiot he should feel like an idiot

805
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,999
That is not mine and one of the reasons that I take this more real than life

806
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,815
Other times that he said will be gone we're done

807
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,911
Anytime that blunt about it

808
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,983
But one of the reasons that I take it as

809
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Morio's

810
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Is a factors soup

811
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
F****** flat lately

812
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Like he's just

813
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
Real slow in like

814
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
Lot of long pauses

815
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:58,783
The long pauses are not too uncommon but it's like he's just no energy just

816
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
F*** it.

817
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
Seeing the full force

818
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:08,255
How's the new world order system to shut off an economy bankrupt

819
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
Farms

820
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
And complete our journey just slavery

821
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,215
Through this process we will discover

822
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,239
Kashmiri

823
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
El Americano

824
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,335
The Renaissance in 1776

825
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,383
We shall set us free

826
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
I am

827
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,247
I am focused today

828
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
I have

829
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,415
Cogitated on what needs to be done.

830
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:43,583
He sounds like he has his own a tranquilizer

831
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
Descend you on

832
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
Next message

833
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,239
If it should you choose to accept the mission

834
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,103
There's no life behind that there's no vigor

835
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,199
Fairly regular these days

836
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,063
Which is one of the reasons why I take it like more

837
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,391
Because generally when you want to rile people up

838
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,951
To your calls or whatever you don't come in with like

839
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,487
Nugget

840
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
But that's that's the vibe he's giving off

841
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,911
Vibrate Now talks about easing to take calls

842
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
And also talks about like

843
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
Ever get to the news

844
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
I really want to have more calls in the show and only get it up

845
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
Within the first hour most days and leaves

846
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
But

847
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,975
You can't do justice each piece of this

848
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
And so why even get to it in fact

849
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,655
Videoclub

850
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
So

851
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,775
The mentality that says

852
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:02,431
There's so much news so I get to any of it it's very dumb

853
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
It's incredible

854
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,367
It's not how you get things done no. Cuz if you have stories that are all big

855
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:15,487
It's better to focus on well then just leave it I can't get to all 5

856
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,559
So it's a ludicrous a strategy

857
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:23,679
It's not uncommon to find yourself thinking something along those lines for a little bit but

858
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:28,031
It seems like he's been doing that his entire career yet

859
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:34,431
It's a dark moment when you want to get back to business and get down to

860
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
Get it done

861
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,623
Focus on actionable items that's how you maximized productivity don't worry about the fight

862
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,207
Look at the one thing with your whole ass not to things with her

863
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,231
That's right

864
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,839
Alex

865
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,911
Should be into he likes folksy nonsense

866
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,983
So Alexander sex with talks about his esteem

867
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,263
Bob and the good guy

868
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
Guys and everybody knows it

869
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,711
Could barely even talk or operate

870
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
You can't shut me off you can't shut you up

871
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Platinum

872
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
The real deal

873
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
You're the real deal that's why

874
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Your prayers

875
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Paramount

876
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,399
Spread the word is penultimate

877
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,751
And then you got the trifecta there but beneath that is a vital support

878
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
Sure

879
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
Spread the word

880
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
Penultimate

881
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
And then that little added

882
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
Magic is the money

883
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,063
Never even wanted my until I tried to shut me down 15 years ago

884
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
God said to me

885
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Operation

886
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,583
Prosperous and you need to do that and I did it you did it

887
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,375
And here we are today and so now

888
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
When you buy products in Fort Wright, Kentucky

889
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
You are

890
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,663
Woohoo so God told him to chase money so

891
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,783
I command you to get that

892
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
Paper

893
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,183
Alex this is God scare people and then sell them gold

894
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
Manipulative way

895
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,023
The only way to stop the demon

896
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
You need to

897
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
Scaring people boy

898
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Wolf Alex

899
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,215
Have you considered super male vitality

900
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,591
Make men feel like they're weak and then sell them pills to solve their problems

901
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,919
Alex water filters

902
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:48,831
Beyond why did I make better water I like that I really do enjoy that

903
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
I don't know I don't

904
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,183
I don't know what God loves and what God doesn't but

905
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
I just have a sense

906
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,535
They wouldn't be so frail set

907
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,423
I started to get the sense of it like we're in trouble

908
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,263
Big trouble

909
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
Rohit go sideways

910
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,847
I don't even know that that's

911
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
Understatement

912
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,455
Tea kettle

913
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
Okay

914
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,575
I don't want to go to that level yet unless we can turn this around but

915
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,111
If you have nothing

916
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Lactulose

917
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
One human

918
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
To do out

919
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
5G Towers

920
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
Before you get killed by the drums

921
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
Something

922
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:43,615
Running around

923
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,255
Not a bad thing

924
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
Vallarta

925
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
Do you want a puppy

926
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
I'm on the spit

927
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
I found your ass

928
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,847
Great analogy

929
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
Tell me I'm a slave

930
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Take your gun

931
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
And what

932
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,759
You're literally going to bring a knife to a gunfight

933
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Whataburger

934
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
Baby burn

935
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Weight Watchers

936
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,511
That we're not at that point yet but I want you to

937
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
Intergenerational

938
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Understand the power you have is all wet

939
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,655
I'm listening

940
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
That the weapon

941
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Or is it

942
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
Write yourself to kill

943
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
Rather people not to kill your ass

944
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
Devil worshippers

945
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,839
Everything you've got and everything you ever are

946
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Oh boy

947
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
One way or another

948
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
But you got to find that spirit and just have

949
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
Know that it's

950
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Jumping

951
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,111
It's going to empower you to work hard and be good and not getting a

952
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
Your wife your husband

953
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
Why was it bad

954
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Their ass

955
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Is Blue Bloods scumbag

956
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,967
Unhappy

957
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
They print

958
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,295
Their hatred of themselves on.

959
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
And we reject

960
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,695
Yeah that was Rose like we're in trouble

961
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
That is a

962
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:13,631
That's a complicated psychodrama that just played out that way it's not yet time to

963
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
It starts out with

964
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:22,335
I could be the Unabomber it goes through to I was a bad husband and father

965
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:27,711
It continues on to ya maybe I am projecting my hate Onto You by telling you that your

966
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Projecting

967
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,807
There are some players to it

968
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,975
I think there's some interesting pieces to with the like him saying

969
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:43,839
Lose one person could take out five of these towers are 15 V power

970
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,935
The idea of having Nothing Left to Lose

971
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,823
Is important to hold onto because I think that that's the mode that Alex is definitely in

972
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,151
We lost this round there's nothing left to lose

973
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:02,015
I have nothing left to lose and I am on Murder Street

974
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Sprite

975
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:09,183
Is that vibe mnd that like yelling about murder murder

976
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:14,303
I think that it's fine I don't know like

977
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
You know someone's going to kill you it's not I do think it's morally wrong to kill them usually the horses

978
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,727
OU

979
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Now

980
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,615
Is getting a vaccine the same thing as someone rushing you with a gun or a knife

981
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
I don't think so you know I would say that Alex is definition of what requires lethal force in self-defense

982
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,599
Might be a little bit off this is the problem with the intolerant left

983
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:43,231
Dad Vine

984
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,303
It's part of what I believe

985
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,191
Then he goes from the yelling about killing and burning these robots into chores

986
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,967
We're not safe we're not safe no this is this

987
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,295
We end up going to break a little bit after that he comes back

988
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:13,695
Do they needed to chill him out a little bit

989
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
They really should have this isn't

990
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
Dude this goes

991
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,631
It's a places you could ever imagine this goes so bad

992
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:28,031
Anybody should have stopped at any point really should have hit the big button that says like like

993
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:34,431
Whatever their first attempt to try and get Alex into a better headspace is playing

994
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,831
You Belong To The City

995
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,415
Every single time he gives a speech over it

996
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,207
He does but it's very cookie

997
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,255
Key cutter by the numbers

998
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:29,471
Your life your children live everything you got

999
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,103
Unleash your own life

1000
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:46,111
I got you your slave all of us all of our people

1001
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:50,207
Before being free

1002
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:55,327
Men's was that promise that dream

1003
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:59,423
So many was realized and soy

1004
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,263
Incredible wealth power

1005
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,335
Came here to try to take

1006
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,663
Power over and try to subvert it

1007
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:14,015
All they had to do was in Bryson

1008
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
I love Humanity

1009
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391

Quick fact check

1012
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
America being viewed Reba freedom

1013
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,335
We had that

1014
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Try to remember

1015
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
So you want six calls but yours wants to tell you about how he's now

1016

1024
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:18,271
Everybody else is he scared

1025
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239

You know what

1028
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
How to kill the Big Bad Wolf

1029
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,087
That was not the moral of that story Apple

1030
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,159
And the Big Bad Wolf

1031
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,743
We were going to attack Iran

1032
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815

Everybody

1036
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
I don't understand that but

1037
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
False

1038
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,359
The world is this

1039
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
Lay it down

1040
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Kissing ass

1041
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,807
But don't let them push that instinct laid out of here

1042
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Your phone calls are coming up

1043
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
Money to fight these wars

1044
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,511
The wind in my sails products you need put it back in stock

1045
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
What the f***

1046
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:11,935
Against

1047
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:17,311
Monsters come out come out or I'll blow your house down in the first little piggy

Barrett 30 cal

1049
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,783
Whatever the f*** I want

1050
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,599
So Alex goes at the money comes back

1051
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Is where it all falls

1052
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
That was keeping it together

1053
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Comparative

1054
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,767
Comparatively

1055
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
Total Staffing

1056
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,887
Okay alright I normally reply

1057
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Maybe

1058
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,215
I would spend more time on that but I can't

1059
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,031
Because Alex completely loses his s***

1060
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,847
Restaurant.com

1061
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
Luby's

1062
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
Does old ladies

1063
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,807
Because he knows he being confident

1064
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
Total depression

1065
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
Nothing

1066
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Where do I

1067
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
I got to be honest with you

1068
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,679
Percent chance we on the total collapse

1069
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Sometimes

1070
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:22,847
I mean baby starving to death I mean you ain't get your medicine I mean it's done

1071
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Vindictive person

1072
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,295
And America shouldn't take the blame why would anyone blame Alex

1073
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:36,415
What is first thought to be 60% chance of this whole thing's going down

1074
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,183
And guess what

1075
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,583
Not my fault probably because somewhere along the line he realizes that it's all of the things that he champ

1076
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
Bands that are going to make the collapse app

1077
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
I think on some subconscious level he might have a feeling about that maybe whenever everybody does the stuff that I was

1078
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,591
I want to do as we've seen over the past 3 years

1079
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
We're all going to die

1080
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,175
Thermite thermite be sound like

1081
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:04,575
Part of his brain that's unacceptable to his conscience that is screaming that I have

1082
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,855
Topeka

1083
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,231
So 60% chance total collapse we get some more numbers in this next clip

1084
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,279
And then Alex makes a confession

1085
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
That's

1086
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,327
Will rock

1087
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
The ages

1088
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,935
This is something like

1089
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,239
This this changes everything

1090
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
Call Dwayne

1091
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,015
You understand so I'll just rhetoric

1092
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,719
Percent of people lived in

1093
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,559
But half of those were self-sufficient

1094
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,959
That's 45% of people were totally self-sufficient

1095
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,567
Today's hits

1096
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,663
We have a collapse

1097
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
My superpowers being honest

1098
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,999
Alex will eat his neighbors

1099
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
When someone needs to send this broadcast

1100
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Quickly

1101
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,751
Neighborhood watch

1102
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:32,895
One of those neighborhood neighborhood apps or people talk to each other stairs one thing

1103
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,711
The Alex should be concerned about its f******

1104
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
King food

1105
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:44,671
He said he's talked to do today Buckaroo protein isn't beat dad

1106
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
Any sort of feeling of like

1107
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
Because he's

1108
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,655
Number one sponsor is a survival food company

1109
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:01,311
Keep talking about how he's ordered more and more boom from Empire

1110
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:06,687
He's had it for a long time

1111
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:11,295
Kind of makes you think it's just time to get it done he's got that holy s*** so f***** up

1112
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,671
For being Auto wolf

1113
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,511
Also Alex is making up numbers about the Great Depression

1114
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Can I get Ensure

1115
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:27,679
Run to the Library of Congress by 1900 the year 1930 percent of the u.s. population that migrated to cities

1116
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,239
And we're living in areas you could be call Urban centers

1117
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:36,895
I don't know if Alex expect people to believe that between 1900 and 1929 approximately two-thirds of the urban Poppy

1118
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
Malaysian relocated

1119
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,735
Back to rural areas but either way

1120
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,623
According to 2018 data from Pew social trends a majority of the US population lives

1121
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,183
In areas that would be qualified as suburban

1122
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
At this point

1123
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,327
Population of approximately 14% at that point and urban comes in around 31

1124
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:02,495
According to Pew one of the primary drivers of the higher level of population in urban areas

1125
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
Immigration

1126
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:08,639
Most of the time people who come to this country from another country aren't doing so to settle in rural Montana

1127
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:14,271
Most of the time they'll gravitate towards locations with the most job opportunities or places with at least some semblance of

1128
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,111
Community that they can connect with like people who share their country of origin or religious

1129
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
Just practices

1130
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,975
Those things are not as likely to be found in rural areas as compared to Urban one

1131
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:27,327
There are other variables but this is one big driver of urban and Suburban population growth

1132
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,863
It's not shared by rural areas

1133
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,215
Anyway I was just making things up but urban and rural areas is Wells with Great Depression

1134
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:39,615
But good to know that he would eat his neighbors did not have a Koreatown

1135
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:43,711
So I don't think people people like

1136
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,295
Part part of larger assimilation is also

1137
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:53,695
The entry entry ability has a lot of that is having people have some sort of a share.

1138
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,511
Vanity with you it makes it so much easier

1139
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:02,399
It's one of the big drivers as like you see larger growth in urban and Suburban areas

1140
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:10,079
But I thought maybe you was just saying I got Eve my neighbors and it was a throwaway thing

1141
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:14,943
Nope we're going to go on a long serious about water

1142
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,479
My superpowers being honest

1143
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
Po-boy

1144
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,343
A few years ago

1145
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,903
I'm literally look at my neighbor's downgoing

1146
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:28,255
Try to hang them up and got them and scan them and chop them off you know what I'm ready my dog

1147
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,887
Superpowers being honest

1148
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,567
3rd Street

1149
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
You thought about that yet

1150
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
Because

1151
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:55,391
My neighbor's neighbor

1152
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,207
Chop his ass up

1153
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
Radu should have tackled him long ago

1154
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,959
This is really stringy you said you found this in the forest

1155
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,519
Dad is this truck is this truck

1156
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,871
Well technically your superpower is being honest

1157
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
Chuck the neighbor

1158
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,479
Not ground chuck while it is ground chuck

1159
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,551
Who's on first year

1160
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
I know we've heard Alex talk a lot in the past about how after 15 days of no food we all become cannibals but

1161
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,559
Don't think I've ever heard him discuss his willingness or dare I say enthusiasm to eat his neighbor

1162
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,631
Fantastical

1163
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:44,031
It made me wonder if I decided to look into cannibalism a little bit and I got two interesting bits of research on the subject that I think Alex should

1164
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
Reconsider

1165
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:51,455
First game from a 2017 article in time about research done by James Cole the senior lecturer

1166
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
Anthropology at the University of Brighton

1167
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:58,367
Cool published a study of nature that looked at the caloric content of a human body

1168
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:03,231
Like all the edible parts we came to the conclusion that it seems unlikely that most of the Historical Inn

1169
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,791
Instances of cannibalism we're driven by a need for food

1170
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,839
Except in cases like the Donner Party

1171
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,495
The reason for this is that as cool put it quote the mental and physical effort to hunt a hominid would presumably be much

1172
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:18,335
What's greater give him the hominins ability to fight run and think their way out of

1173
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
The hunt

1174
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,687
What are you getting at is that compared to most any other source of food

1175
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
The Cal would expand

1176
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
To eat a person

1177
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,295
But almost not be worth it from a nutritional perspective

1178
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,831
It's a bad strategy

1179
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:35,231
Unless you literally have no other option and even then you probably do have a better option you haven't considered like various wild plants

1180
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
So what you're saying is that he has come to

1181
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Movie scientific

1182
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:44,447
Conclusion that man is the most dangerous game or the most calorie intensive

1183
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:51,103
Yeah you'd be like most of the time I would like any kind of cannibalism was little ritualistic

1184
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Already dead

1185
01:13:53,919 --> 01:14:00,063
The second article I found was pretty interesting it was in the sun discussing a recent study published in the Journal of forensic science

1186
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:05,695
Researchers profiled five cases of people who practice cannibalism in interesting commonality

1187
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:12,095
Essentially what they found was the people who ended up eating other people are pretty consistently either severely schizophrenic

1188
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,911
Or their survivors of intensely dysfunctional childhood

1189
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,983
In the case of two case studies

1190
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:18,751
He's quote

1191
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:25,151
Feelings of humiliation seem to be the trigger and both patients assaulted their victims at a time when they suffered a loss of

1192
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
Self-esteem

1193
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:32,319
Rancid Alex's naturally he's talking about being so right

1194
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:38,719
We suffer in a bit of a loss of self-esteem do think he's being serious I found that threat

1195
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,559
To be trouble from the Sun article

1196
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:48,703
In the cases of cannibalism in patients who suffer from schizophrenia the researchers found there was a history of emotional fiction

1197
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,007
Hostility in their parent-child relationship

1198
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,079
The academics concluded the schizophrenic

1199
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,175
Performed cannibalism it as a very extreme reaction of self-defense

1200
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,967
Do a threat of Destruction

1201
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
Physical or psychological

1202
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:07,647
Wow for the ones with a personality disorder cannibalism boosted their self-esteem and relieve tension

1203
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,719
Quote ego and narcissism are the central issue

1204
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,583
With a desire to overcome frustrations by means of an extraordinary Act

1205
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,423
It kind of sounds like if you take if you just replace

1206
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:25,311
I'm actually eating people and talking about eating people if she had that same thing

1207
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:29,151
Is looking for you looking to overcome deep-rooted frustration

1208
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
He feels

1209
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:35,807
Seems like an extreme reaction of self-defense to a threat of Destruction physical or psychological

1210
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:36,831
It's

1211
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:42,975
I would assume he is somehow hostility in his parent-child relationships

1212
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
What does all this mean

1213
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,143
Maybe nothing or maybe I totally believe it when Alex

1214
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,703
This is one of the few tabs where I'm really bummed out that

1215
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
Set your researches

1216
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
Is pretty good because

1217
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
I was really hoping that this was kind of a

1218
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:02,687
Tough talk kind of situation but now that he fits the profile I don't like that at all

1219
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:07,807
Not like that at all about Alex

1220
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
He would say that everything

1221
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
To be clear I don't think Alex is going to eat anybody but I think that the mental state that he's presenting

1222
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,327
Seem to follow at least some of the soup

1223
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,119
Superficial characteristics in these studies

1224
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Which is not great

1225
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
In some ways just being

1226
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,031
I wouldn't even say I would eat a person

1227
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,591
Unless I was being very obviously

1228
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Funny about

1229
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:37,759
Probably in the

1230
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
You know I hated that that's all that coconut lime seltzer

1231
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:48,255
That be way worse because

1232
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
So

1233
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,887
I probably wouldn't have looked into that stuff if it wasn't like

1234
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
He talks about it for a long

1235
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Oh boy

1236
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
Your ass first

1237
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
You're not

1238
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Did you out of those bunkers

1239
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
You out of those holes

1240
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:15,391
I'll get in there God's last thing I do imma get my hands around your throat

1241
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,719
You know that's why you're going to eat your ass

1242
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
You should have thought about that when you

1243
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
The long time ago

1244
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:31,263
I was going to eat the globalist accept Jesus Christ remember that I

1245
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,311
Remember the letter to the Thessalonians

1246
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
I do remember that where it was like look

1247
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,919
You guys don't accept Christ we're going to eat your ass

1248
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
That's just the rule

1249
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,015
I just wrote Jesus told me this is

1250
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
So weird

1251
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:46,111
Turn your asses other cheek so I can eat it

1252
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,511
This is the weirdest thing I've ever heard on this show a protracted rant about how

1253
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,375
It starts with I'm going to eat my papers in order to keep my children

1254
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,471
I meant dick out the globalist and I'm going to eat them first

1255
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:06,591
I'm going to be honest this is starting to sound less about sustenance

1256
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,687
I'm going to be straight with you Dad yeah I think this isn't about food

1257
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
I think you've got

1258
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
I don't

1259
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,927
Like I understand he's being like a show man

1260
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,999
Being over-the-top and what-have-you but I also don't think he's joking

1261
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,359
Was a metaphysical hypothetical buddy it's really not and let's just let's just get past the

1262
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
The jokes here

1263
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
Yes let's get past though

1264
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,479

1265
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:49,599
Marion government study for South Africa. Stacy Jeremy directions to Panda South America

1266
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,975

1267
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
Within 14 days almost

1268
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,839
Suicide

1269
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
Right before I

1270
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Did that but

1271
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
What

1272
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359

1273
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:38,751

1276
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,383
Let's get past the joke

1277
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,687
I want you to know

1278
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967

So ridiculous okay also

1282
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:01,279
People who've gone on hunger strikes

1283
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
Just making that up because he's stupid not to justify his fantasies about eating his enemies which is an interesting new low

1284
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
I got to say he never seen the show naked and afraid they're out there for 2 or 3 weeks every time and then

1285
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
Never resort to cannibalism

1286
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,664
Answer that's a good counterexample

1287
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,016
I'll be interested to see his Source on this like 14-day cannibalism

1288
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,856
I'm just rattling off countries and saying the word actuary isn't going to do it

1289
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
Like a great diet

1290
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,672
14 day cannabis

Parentheses

1308
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:41,120
Will totally eat somebody to eat people for about 15 minutes now because of cord

1309
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680

That is the eating people version of if I did it

1311
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:58,016
Alex is presenting this in like a really cowardly way even in this stupid hypothetical because he's saying like

1312
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:04,416
Do this to feed my children also raises the question for me you're going to make your kids be cannibals

1313
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,184
Of course that's

1314
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,208
F***** up

1315
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:12,608

I don't know I mean

1325
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:57,408
It's such an it's such a shame that things from the show can't be used in court

1326
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:03,040
I can't imagine how easily you could win custody if you just played a tape of

1327
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:07,648
I will feed them until tell my children here on Earth

1328
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:11,744
He promised to lie to his children and make them eat people

1329
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,048
And he was not joking

1330
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:20,448
He said he was a joke

1331
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,520
Strike that from the record seeing as how it's obviously bulshit

1332
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288

1333
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568

01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:56,800
A point or also can be pretty hardcore survivors at that point he's not going to be able to find easypickins to eat

1340
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:01,664
Out of here is keeping his neighbor in the freezer he's prepared

1341
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,968
I could I could see that

1342
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:11,392

Daughter of a great headspace

1395
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Perhaps

1397
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,600

01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,144
Cuz he starts thinking about all the abortion

1402
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,704
Cities paid for

1403
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
And like this is

1404
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
This is a real

1405
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,592
Jarring swing of emotions

1406
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360

I feel guilty every time I'm around my children

1411
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
But I'm not building some

1412
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
Because

1413
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
They know what they've done

1414
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,520
Genetic selfishness

1415
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
Constantly like I have dreams about

01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,176
Is Ron Ron go to Northern

1417
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,648

01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
My daughter

1419
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,256
My daughter I just constantly worried about them

1420
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,072

01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,936
Tried to save the whole thing and I you tried to save it I don't know if we can save any other folks

1422
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
God tells me

1423
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
How many

1424
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,712
You probably killed 15-20 kids you know of

But you can't you can't do an entire segment about how excited and willing you are to eat people and then

1448
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,712

Someone needs to stop it like

01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,144
Someone cares needs to stop and there is no one

1481
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,936

01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,984

01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,904
Cut the crap

1487
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,024
You are and what you stand for forever

1488
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,328
I guess that's all that ever matter

1489
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,656
In New Jersey

1490
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,008
What an awkward throat

1491
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:55,776
Call Zack

1492
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:59,104
Let's not talk about everything I've said here

1493
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,944
Let's pretend that didn't happen I am Jovi New Jersey Alex quick question

1494
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,224

I will take my answer out there

1496
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,928
So Alex doctor this Joe character and it's it's whatever but he starts rambling about the end of the world

1497
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
I want to watch

1498
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,536
That's why they did this if they're losing

1499
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
Beautiful plant

1500
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,472
In the projection it's exactly as Revelation says

1501
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:33,152
They're going to end

1502
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:40,576
I love you balls and come back

1503
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,368
I'm sorry I've been out of control today

1504
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
Hoo-boy

1505
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,192
Just going to ride that at Mystic break in the other direction

1506
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:58,240
Going to ride that at I've been out of control

1507
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,032
So yeah

1508
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
It's

1509
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:06,176
It's interesting to talk him here in this next clip. Paul

1510
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,712
Paul Joseph Watson

1511
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,272
And something

1512
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:16,672
F****** happy for a man

1513
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:21,280
Apprentices

1514
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
What does Asante say about apprentices

1515
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
Children

1516
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,312
The long after you've gone to come

1517
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:39,968
I got a plan takes over nice car

1518
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,784
Suppose taking over the next hour and I got to say something

1519
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:48,672
He's not this is still the second hours

1520
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,232
It seems like he's losing

1521
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:56,864
In-Shape particularly in the second hour

1522
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,656
He still has another hour

1523
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,448
Wish I was that big but

1524
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,752
Yes yes it does feel that way

1525
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
Wheels

1526
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,800
Bully off the way

1527
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:09,664
So Alex gets to talking to more about this the world is starving narrative

1528
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,224
Should I tease on

1529
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
He's

1530
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:16,064
Right in some ways and then wrong and some others

1531
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,136
Hatchimals descriptions that conservatives

1532
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,768
We need to come out and say I drama start African

1533
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,304
White Americans and Asians the death

1534
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,096
We don't support that

1535
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:35,008
133

1536
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,336
Don't stop

1537
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,504
The president on this last week

1538
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,296
Mobile horses

1539
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,648
Kill your ass

1540
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,928
Okay great

1541
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,696
Dude

1542
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:58,048
I can't imagine all those babies in Africa and Latin America

1543
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
Overpopulated novel populated

1544
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Grandmother has off

1545
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,216
Little kids begging for food and dying

1546
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,056
Not in my DNA

1547
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,152
The real world

1548
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,200
133 million people

1549
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
Starving

1550
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:26,208
There's not a Million Dead worldwide virus

1551
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,744
Millions are dying

1552
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,768
Why

1553
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Do do

1554
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,400
265 million starving sorry it's going up

1555
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:39,008
To the Patriots a nationalist

1556
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:39,776
Some Christians

1557
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,800
Evil white man

1558
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,128
Very much care

1559
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,152
Yeah

1560
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,456
If that's the only thing you're bringing to the table

1561
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,784
Unfortunately everything else you talking about is wrong

1562
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,320
It's not

1563
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:58,976
65 Million number is not a new development it's just from the same Guardian article he's been siding on the story the whole time

1564
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,256
He's ever read it though

1565
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,280
I can tell that

1566
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,888
The Articles published on April 21st and it warns that due to the crisis were in now quote

1567
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:10,240
At least 265 million are being pushed to the brink of starvation

1568
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:15,104
All experts on the topic agree that the two most essential things needed to stop the lumaca task

1569
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,896
Tree is money and access

1570
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:21,504
We can all donate and try to make a difference that way we can pressure our government to take

1571
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Seriously

1572
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:25,344
And provide funding to organizations are on the ground helping

1573
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,928
Beyond that these people who are the aid workers need access

1574
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,232
They need to be able to cross borders to get the assist

1575
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
Distance to the people who need it

1576
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:38,912
The central message of this article which chiefly quotes Beasley the head of the UN world food programme

1577
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Is that quote

1578
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:45,056
We can stop this becoming a world wide spread famine but we need to act quickly and smart

1579
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,848
That's the bottom line

1580
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
So weird

1581
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:51,456
This article is published under the global development initiative at the guardian

1582
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,272
And if you actually read the article there's a little icon that says

1583
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,832
Supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1584
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:02,720
The content is editorially independent but the only reason a lot is reporting that Alex is relying on to build his

1585
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,024
Completely nonsensical and exploitative narrative

1586
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:09,632
Exist the only reason it exists is because of money donated by the very people

1587
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,960
He's trying to paint does the arch villains were trying to starve the developing world

1588
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:16,544
So again I say take this problem seriously

1589
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,872
But don't for a second think that Alex gives a single s*** about

1590
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:26,784
These people are props to him and he'll gladly yellow about their deaths to make his political point but he wouldn't do one inconvenient thing

1591
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
To help them out

1592
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
So again

1593
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,880
Very serious issue

1594
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,184
And I'm glad that Alex is bringing it up

1595
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,000
That's other people are bringing it up

1596
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,816
I guess I'm not glad he's bringing it up cuz he's just using

1597
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,584
Yeah

1598
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,120
I mean even then it is

1599
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,400
His hero his

1600
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Messiah

1601
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
As he puts it

1602
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,520
Is able to do this at any time

1603
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,848
And is only going to use it as a trump

1604
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,872
Card if

1605
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,640
He needs to

1606
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,456
Well

1607
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
He would never ever do it

1608
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
And this is the good

1609
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:04,160
He's saying the trump card is accusing people of being racist if they don't help because he Alex believes

1610
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:10,560
That accusations of racism are like Magic Bullets or something

1611
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
I bet Trump could

1612
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,144
Unilaterally take care of all of this V wanted to

1613
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:19,776
I'm not sure that's a hundred percent true but he certainly could do it it's not even like

1614
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Mostly

1615
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,432
I'm not an expert in these issues but I do know there's more we could be doing oh yeah

1616
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,968
So anyway

1617
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,248
Alex gets

1618
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,784
The call now

1619
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,320
And this is a bad call

1620
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Mr. Jones

1621
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,024
Mind

1622
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,816
I'm just wondering

1623
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,096
Do you think we're going to survive

1624
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
School

1625
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,128
Hold on to that

1626
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,712
So earlier when he was talking to that

1627
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:04,576
Speaking extemporaneously

1628
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,856
Teen 5G Towers

1629
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:11,232
Another caller is asking if we're going to survive and he says no

1630
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,816
It seems that way it seems like if you put these

1631
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,096
Two pieces of

1632
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,912
Information

1633
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,496
Rhetoric that he's putting out on his episode your left at the conclusion

1634
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,288
None of us have anything left to lose

1635
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:28,896
Enter Wendy's collar discusses what he really wants to talk about with Alex

1636
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,712
This sounds like a terrorist planning session

1637
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,784
My buddy he just got in they are already.

1638
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,064
Protest

1639
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
And 30th

1640
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Pod beautiful

1641
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,744
Your spirit

1642
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:48,352
Totally survives but your spirit as free will

1643
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
Centerpoint it

1644
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:53,216
Tell you something you don't know Hunter

1645
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,616
Play Giselle playing on her

1646
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
For the Lord

1647
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,944
Damn right brother

1648
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
That seems

1649
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:06,784
Yeah

1650
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,856
That seems like a little bit of kind of

1651
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:15,488
And I know they even made this gun to a protest

1652
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:21,376
Isn't necessarily a terrorist act but the way he's talking about wheat being my buddy bought AR-15

1653
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,680
To go to the protest

1654
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:25,216
Matt is a different

1655
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:28,032
Kind of vibe that I'm getting from that caller

1656
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:33,920
I don't know I'm not I could be over sensitive on a

1657
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,480
It's very f***** up it feels f***** up

1658
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,552
The comparison

1659
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,832
Things are like

1660
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,112
Between

1661
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Leftist

1662
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
Rally's in

1663
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,184
And protest

1664
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
Swear

1665
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,720
The cops

1666
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,768
Fuk up people for just wearing a mask

1667
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:53,120
And then you look at these protests then you see them in full f****** Decked Out

1668
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,520
3 better not wearing masks a lot of them but they're like that

1669
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,896
But part of the difference in

1670
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,176
The treatment is obviously

1671
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
Ideology

1672
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,272
The cops are Fascist

1673
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,576
Another part of it is that

1674
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
These guys

1675
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:18,208
Do seem like they were in the brink of murdering a s*** ton of people at all

1676
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:24,608
Apparently there is a massive threat

1677
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
These protests

1678
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,728
So Alex takes a break from calls

1679
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:34,080
Cuz he wants to put a picture of his daughter up on screen

1680
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,616
Which is f***** up

1681
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:42,016
I'm going to Doc's my daughter yeah he starts crying talking about

1682
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:48,416
Sky

1683
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:54,816
Look at your children everything is good you see

1684
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,888
DC. Right there

1685
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,776
Is the times of the enemy coming in on assessor of years ago

1686
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,080
So perfect so pure

1687
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,384
God shines through her

1688
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,368
I just feel

1689
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,560
Because you can lie to yourself all day long

1690
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,376
Join the New World Order man

1691
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,680
You just turned your kids over to hell

1692
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,264
And they're so innocent they're so good they're so pure

1693
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,800
And they just want to

1694
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,384
Understanding Universe look up here she is looking at you

1695
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:44,736
They all you put your daughter on are you make her a Target she's already at Target

1696
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:48,832
What she's already under attack by Eagles like every child

1697
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,536
They want a corrupt that

1698
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:58,816
Till that

1699
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,168
Go home

1700
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:07,776
Hey Dad.

1701
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,800
Thank you for ordering pizza

1702
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:16,992
Second shift today you said you were going to feed me people and then you put my picture up

1703
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,040
So could you

1704
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,880
Never do that again or be on your show

1705
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,952
Please stop within like an hour

1706
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:32,352
Yes doing this diatribe about cannibalism and then crying about his daughter was showing the picture of her like it

1707
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:36,704
Yeah I can't stand like this is not okay

1708
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,728
Number of

1709
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Different levels

1710
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,544
It's really incomprehensible

1711
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,080
And yet in 2020 hit mix

1712
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:42,848
So much

1713
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:49,248
I guess so somebody be screaming about cannibalism on the radio

1714
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:55,648
Silly that it hasn't been that part I'm thrilled with I guess it does indicate that the Overton window

1715
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,976
It shifted for Alex to an almost incomprehensible

1716
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,280
Beyond The Pale at least

1717
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,352
Yeah but if I had to choose

1718
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,632
This last part

1719
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:12,032
Mercury's crying and talk about his daughter for it talk about cannibalism

1720
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,824
Kind of interesting and funny

1721
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,104
This is sad

1722
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,920
And doesn't belong on public Highway

1723
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:24,320
Absolutely children and she makes me uncomfortable on her behalf

1724
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,648
You're up I doubt it I don't know

1725
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:31,232
I can't say yes or no cuz he doesn't

1726
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:34,304
It's simply implied that he just did it

1727
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
Anyway

1728
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:42,752
Alex Goes to another caller that I feel like he's trying to prod on to do illegal things

1729
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
Hey Alex would you eat me

1730
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Brother Ali

1735
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,064
Good and evil sir

1736
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,880
Spiritual war

1737
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,648
We are

1738
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,952
How many levels but we're not

1739

Also combat

1741

On a different level

1742
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:19,616
One of my best friend's is a 30-year Army vet

1743
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,480
Ready

01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,488
I am respected get the f*** out of here

1758
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:13,632
But the same caller brings up that his sister was possessed by a demon and Alex deals with

1759
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
About as well as you can

1760
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:18,496
For now is the one-year anniversary of my father

1761
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:19,520
Okay

1762
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
Sister who is under demonic possession

1763
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,224
Exactly 28 weeks

1764
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,272
2 days and I know that number cuz

1765
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
Nothing I saw

1766
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
During my father

1767
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,208
Suffern

1768
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,768
In the world

1769
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:45,120
You're right as above so below Carlos God bless you I appreciate your call

1770
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:50,496
In California another call from California go ahead night was not done

1771
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:53,312
He was not heated not really made his point I was just

1772
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:59,456
Psycho possession stories

1773
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
My job

1774
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Not yours

1775
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,296
I know it's b*******

1776
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,600
So I can say it exactly

1777
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:08,160
You are very serious about demon busy

1778
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,696
And that is an issue for me

1779
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:11,488
And I just said I was going to eat

1780
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
People

1781
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,984
Remember people using it back

1782
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,264
In the earlier days

1783
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:27,616
Remember back when we listen to older episodes people would call into be like

1784
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,688
Hey can I promote my blog can I promote my new CD

1785
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,528
I feel like this color is like really doing the archetype

1786
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,576
Infowars collars from the

1787
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
Repast

1788
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,416
Real quick

1789
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,232
I have a patent for a device

1790
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,024
Temporary devices

1791
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
Email server

1792
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,712
God bless you both

1793
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:05,760
What's up

1794
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,808
Bye Felicia Collins ragged old Trump

1795
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:14,464
So he's now a instead of promoting your CD or whatever you know as I can get it

1796
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,000
Yeah

1797
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:18,560
1 800 invention or whatever it is

1798
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,584
What happened

1799
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:22,144
It I mean they're both delusional like

1800
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,472
Infowars being an outlet for your new album is

1801
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Ridiculous

1802
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:33,152
But it's equally ridiculous that I have to call into Infowars in the president's going to hear about my patents going to save manual

1803
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Factoring in America

1804
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,968
That's all I needed to hear

1805
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:41,600
Sounds good another collar and it's a woman who is scared she's a little bit upset

1806
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:46,208
I don't really care to get into any of the content of it but

1807
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,000
Response is really weird

1808
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,792
You're upset

1809
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,328
What's a normal thing

1810
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
You're an early warning system you care

1811
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:57,216
So you're upset I don't give you on the same way

1812
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,800
Airfly spring Lighting in

1813
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,944
I just feel

1814
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,224
Powerful

1815
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,784
Hearing your voice concern

1816
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,880
The men

1817
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,672
Will respond you say that

1818
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,720
Yeah yeah

1819
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:21,280
I feel it

1820
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:27,936
Oh that's really weird

1821
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
That's

1822
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,776
The phrasing on that is and yeah

1823
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:37,664
I love eating the ass of scared women I'll tell you that right now it gives you power gives you so much

1824
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,224
Yeah that's really strange

1825
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,040
Nothing to hear

1826
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:49,440
I think I understand what he's trying to say adrenaline to come to people's Aid

1827
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:52,768
Whatever I wanted million-dollar in crisis if you can help them

1828
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
Laq

1829
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:59,680
Archetypal stories of people lifting up cars at

1830
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:03,776
He's trying to say first of all

1831
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,824
Yeah Ed second

1832
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
He doesn't know how to spell

1833
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
Cuz it sounds

1834
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,200
Like I gain power from scared women

1835
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:12,736
Yeah it does seem like

1836
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,040
It does seem like he's trying to like referee

1837
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,064
Prince's chivalrous

1838
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,832
Bulshit

1839
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:21,440
You're a woman in danger and I've become so powerful

1840
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:27,840
But I'm worried about my daughter

1841
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:32,704
Can't protect themselves Santa lies in putting a little box somewhere so that go

1842
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,544
So also on this episode Alex interviews Jim hoft

1843
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,872
From Gateway pundit but I don't care I found it incredibly boring

1844
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:43,200
Alex signing off

1845
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,480
And

1846
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,040
He did not get to the callers he expect

1847
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
Do

1848
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:50,112
And this includes one of the saddest

1849
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,904
Lamest sales pitches

1850
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,952

Usually the times that try men's Souls

1855
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:16,224
This is Wild Planet deep space ball

1856
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,296
A like being peace and others

1857
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:22,368
But God giving us away to counter

1858
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:28,512

Alright Jimmy Carson said an end date for Heelys

1863
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:49,760
Is 11 old

1864
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:54,112
And you know you had a whole couple weeks of just look

1865
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:58,208
Looking back at his career. Real softball interviews everybody

1866
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:04,608
Everybody celebrated his career last week of over-the-top

1867
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:11,008
Lashing out kind of way

1868
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
Person that you eat

1869
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:19,456
But

1870
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:26,112
I would say not classy certainly but if you do after flameout I do definitely appreciate

1871
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,904
The cannibalism talk I mean

1872
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,440
When I heard that

1873
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,720
I thought

1874
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,792
I don't even know how to

1875
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,096
Can't tell you how much I was laughing

1876
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:37,888
While I was

1877
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,728
This f****** guy

1878
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:47,360
What it started I thought like that stupid

1879
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,664
I've listened to Alex

1880
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,504
Everyday for 3 years and I couldn't believe what I was hearing

1881
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,552
I couldn't believe that someone

1882
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,088
Hey Alex

1883
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,624
This is too much

1884
01:52:59,136 --> 01:52:59,904
This is too much

1885
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:06,560
You are going on and on about brutally murdering your neighbors and eating them

1886
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,912
Sake there is that it's too much.

1887
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,960
Couldn't believe it

1888
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:16,288
I think we got off the topic and came back to it and

1889
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:19,616
Talked about feeding his kids it's saying it's beef just like

1890
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,200
Ludacris

1891
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:28,064
Honestly this is a little bit how I want Alex Trebek's last Jeopardy episode

1892
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
I think that would be the

1893
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:32,416
And now your daily double

1894
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:40,096
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry the answer is what is it again

1895
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:45,984
So

1896
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,336
Schoolboy no one expected Alex to deal with the ideas of his own

1897
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:52,128
Shows mortality

1898
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,664
Gracefully

1899
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,968
And I guess we just couldn't imagine

1900
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,760
This would be

1901
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
The vibe

1902
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,576
