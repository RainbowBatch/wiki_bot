Terrible hiccups

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,344
At my instinct

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744

00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
Super-awesome

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Remember

15
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816

00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,384
The glory of Youth

20
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Especially since I've been like

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Over 21

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
Yeah I think the only New Years that I really remember

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Because the rest of them have been an absolute

24
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
Was when I was like

25
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,888
Chicago

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
I was at Columbia

27
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
We just

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Actually

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
When

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Like we went all over

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Morning

32
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992

00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Peed on the subway

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832

Of course it was 4 a.m.

38
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936

00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Glory Days Of Youth kind of music

40
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
I've got

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,456
I think one year was like an open bar thing

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Exact in Columbia

43
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136
With me and my friends never would have gone to an open bar for like twenty bucks

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
I remember I left

45
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,096
I believe a couple times to go to

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
Fortnite but I'm pretty sure

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
But I got into a little altercation with the

48
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
The DJ

49
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,528
I don't like going to the club

50
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Hey could you play

52

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Too loud

He was playing music that I thought was

59
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
Just real bad

60
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096

112
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Thought to have

How much better would it be

122
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623

147
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
You've been around since about 2011

00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Michael is

00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167

As soon as you hear his voice you will remember and remember how much you like him

157
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Now it is

158
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359

00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663

00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111

00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
Exactly

386
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
Exercise equipment

387
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
There's a hacker

388
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
But like

389
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,432
If you have a position where you're on

390
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,504
You think you would make use of that time

391
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Like really

392
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
If you're someone who has a

393
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
W

394
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
Your time talking about how

395
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
Exercise equipment

396
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
That's well

397
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,792
Like well-traveled

398
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
Maybe you're not

399
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Maybe don't have a lot to say

400
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
I don't like

401
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,616
Exercise equipment

402
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Rich

403
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
Maybe a week or two after this

404
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
He comes in with a

405
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
This one this one is going to burn

406
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Court will decide whether the government can ban them

407
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
Rather video games

408
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:19,296
For any reason whatsoever

409
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,880
Weather

410
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
An answer is yes

00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Non-Stop

412
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Something very very wrong there

413
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Violet

414
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:53,088
He said the repetitive

415
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:59,488
Sure

416
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:04,608
Corner of the world

417
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:11,776
Just worried about

418
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,408
I sure as heck would prefer any activities

419
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
As opposed to the video lobotomy

420
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
I took holiday game is on Wyatt

Supermax

423
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Where aliens are killed

424
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
I think he thinks that all video games are just Space Invaders early not realizing

425
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,616
Really compelling narrative structures

426
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
Staring at a computer

427
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Ulta

428
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Also yeah

429
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
But you know the most social drug out there is

430
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
You know how when you get high

431
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
You do sit around and

432
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Chinese food

433
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
You go out with a lot of friends and you get your

434
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
You get your jollies

435
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
20%

436
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,312
There was even a

437
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
The kid smokes marijuana

438
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
And then some

439
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
Quoting drug

440
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Psh

441
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Anyway

442
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:41,120
Aculate my thoughts precisely

443
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,448
Cyborg

444
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
One day

445
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,432
Try to interview for a job

446
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
86

447
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:02,112
A kid I'll bet never shakes the interviewers hand and if so what's that creepy squishy none

448
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
Chelo's

449
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,608
Because he's never used

00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
Enjoy yourself created sense of entitlement

451
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664

Games make you happy

456
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
These are games

457
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
Mind-numbing graphics

458
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,168
Has he ever played a video I don't fuc

459
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
No sew

460
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Describing just being

461
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,064
You can already see if it was hot

462
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
Fundamental

463
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:10,464
Problem with us doing

464
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,328
To be funny I know it's not going there

465
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,632
Unfortunately we're going to have to drift into

466
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Construction of

467
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008

He's trying to make you

469
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Even though he's trying to make them in

470
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,760
I think he's against video

471
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
The end of that be against

472
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
The idea of legislating against

473
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,256
What is this

474
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,328
Manifesting

475
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
Shaking his fist

00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
Literally

480
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
It's all just

481
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
Exercise equipment

482
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512

To the cyborg

484
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
The take is that he

485
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
He's not even doing the regular take

486
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,312
You just like that you think violent video games are bad

487
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
Pac-Man make you unemployable

488
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968

491
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
This next one is nuclear

492
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
I would like to take this opportunity to describe a subject of great annoyance

493
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
Again

494
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,200
Problems

495
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
How bad can my annoyance possibly be

496
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
Play frankly

497
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,184
Now where was I

498
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Backpacks

499
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:22,816
Big purses satchels bags over the shoulder

500
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
Or fixed attached or suspended from the back

501
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,496
But it contains face like a subway car

502
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,872
When is this important

503
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,736
Inconvenience

504
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,832

Maybe it's me maybe I'm a superhuman sentient

508
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192

Look Bloomberg

513
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
You want to pass the law that actually makes sense

514
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
It doesn't

Wearing a backpack or a statue

518
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
Or bag or suspended via shoulder strap that touches intrusive or

As you see

530
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,912
What the f***

531
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
So if I understand correctly

532
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
I know that's serious.

533
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,088
Let's the crack of this conversation

534
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
All of them

535
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
Is why our society is falling

536
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
Part of the comedy like that's in big hard labor

537
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:39,776

Ranch

541
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
I am struggling to remember why the

542
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
80s comedy

543
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,864
And I can't be killed

On the train

548
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Where would they go

549
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,712
Like I knows it like that part about like hard labor

550
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
But if you even think about what

551
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
What would you

552
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Like to make a rule

553
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Like

554
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,168
What kind of a nightmare fascist

555
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
They're like no backpacks in public

You know people are going to get around

560
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Smuggling bag

561
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Exit

562
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
You know they're going to get

563
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Through the

564
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Security guard

565
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
You know what they're going to hide the back

566
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
In a bigger bag

567
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,496
Look I can never catch him it's nice to be

568
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Considerate

Back from O'Hare

571
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,760
But you can never really be that upset by

572
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,112
People with luggage on the train are you going

573
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,696
I'm furious with them and they need to do 5 years hard labor

574
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
You should never have taken

575
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
I'm pissed off

576
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
Well now what you're really critiquing

577
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
Complaints

578
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
A train

579
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,824
I'm not being able to afford

580
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,712
Punching down issues you know you know

581
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,760
Comedians never punched

582
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Doubt

583
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
Dislike

584
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,184
There's no there's no way to really put a finer point on this

585
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
He's not this is an area

586
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Perspective

587
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Peoria

588
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
It's interesting

589
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Because in these early

590
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Days

591
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480

Heather perspective

593
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
Kind of cranky old man

594
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
A little bit

595
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Decent

596
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
Analysis every now and again

597
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
It might surprise you

598
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,144
Next weapon would absolutely completely non facetiously

599
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,192
This next clip is a little bit surprising

600
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,504
It is rare that I don't care about something I have opinions about

601
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
I mean everything

602
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
That I can say the following

603
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,256
I guess birth claims namely that he's at the president

604
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
Wasn't born in this country

605
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Or

606
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
Fishy about the story

607
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,680
I can say unequivocally

608
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
And that's all because if

609
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,808
Here we are halfway through his first term

610
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Okay Donnie

611
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,392
Maker cake

612
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Splat

613
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:45,536
You see maybe it's the prosecutor in me but call me Waikiki

614
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
I want this thing called

615
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Make Your Case

616
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,728
And something's fishy in exactly cause of action

617
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,664
No Maybe.

618
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,248
Certificate of live birth

619
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
And the country

620
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:10,880
As per usual couldn't care less about this

621
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:15,232
What exactly why the industry but I love the fact

622
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
Eddie's driving msnbc's

623
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,560
Chris Matthews

624
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
That's not a very long ride

625
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
Anything that makes big red and yellow produce voluminous and prodigious pools of saliva makes me high

626
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:35,712
Happy as far as being the same

627
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Your fire

628
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Your claim so far

629
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,928
But you're driving Chris Matthews

630
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,024
And I love that Sophie

631
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
The hardball dude

632
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,936
You know and I know that if he had Chinese out Sarah Palin

633
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
No it's true Matthew

634
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
I was true

635
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
I personally hate

636
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,968
Who think they're funny when they're not let the leprosy that tops my list of stuff I load

637
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
It's leprosy and people who think they're funny

638
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:22,816
I'm going to leave that there for a second let him finish the quote but that is a crazy 12 of things you're mad about

639
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,680
A joke

640
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
Have been used

641
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
And from here on

642
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:34,080
Give me the subject matter is absolutely and thoroughly exhausted

643
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,968
There is nothing new novel or vaguely unique about anything of relating to or pertaining to that

644
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
Please

645
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,832
Okay

646
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720

Improve it

656
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224

659
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
I think that's pretty

660
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
In the general population

661
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,024
But in the population of Alex Jones

662
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864

Here's my question

667
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Clearly

668
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920

669
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968

670
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368

It's what you'd expect

682
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
It's not an anomaly

Not really

691
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
It's not worth our time

692
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
What is worth our time

693
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496

00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,959
Because of the consistency of the polyester torch fabric

774
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
Ventilation would not exist

775
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,847
Add hyperthermia 17 within 10 minutes

776
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Stroll

777
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
You put on this thermal blanket

778
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
Like I'd worked for you to get anywhere near an open flame I'll fix your mask

779
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,183
I did make it wait until that night alone

780
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,583
Knocking on strange neighbors doors

781
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Hearing the stories of kids

782
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
Running clip Diablo

783
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,935
A razor blade

784
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,471
Damage

785
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
Stuck with me to this day

786
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
That was Halloween

787
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Baptist

788
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
Demented garbage today

789
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Trick

790
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
Coming

791
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
As you see fit

792
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Comment does UCF

793
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Become his goodnight

794
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,719
Good luck

795
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
I don't like you

796
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:24,351
Talking about the idea of razor blades

797
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,935
Remembers

798
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
The people laugh

799
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Come up with cuz I've watched

800
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
Pretty laugh but like it was a big

801
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:45,599
And I think it's cuz it's a holiday like Halloween episode

802
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Studio

803
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,671
The holiday

804
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,743
We get to drink at work

805
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Watch this

806
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
If I was if I was

807
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
UHF

808
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Station

809
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
I'm not doing great

810
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
If I was there and I saw this

811
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,591
Hilarious but not because of what

812
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
He was often will last

813
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
Wow

814
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,855
Happy Halloween

815
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,903
Yeah

816
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
I don't want people to laugh

817
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Be like

818
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
You take a job

819
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Yeah

820
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
Lionel start

821
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
Have a flight transformation

822
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Can trace it

823
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,663
Around 1

824
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Alexa

825
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
Start to see a little bit more

826
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Weird

827
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
The stuff that were not covered

828
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
I wonder if

829
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
He doesn't like him

830
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
Know that

831
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Fit right in

832
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:08,287
The real deal with Bill McNeil

833
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,639
Basically

834
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,527
Lionel is living a news radio pit basically

835
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
I want

836
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:36,959
You're going to hear it at least six or seven more times

837
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,031
I think what I would do

838
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,311
If I was going to punch up here

839
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Play the theme song

840
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
And then do a light

841
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Round Table

842
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,199
Him with any topic

843
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
How do you feel

844
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
How do you feel about that

845
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
Get it get it in and out within 2 minutes

846
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Amigos

847
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
If you wrote

848
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
0

849
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,887
Washington helped bump this up

850
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Page-one rewrite

851
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,567
It's just the whole thing I recast it I probably take it out of PIX11

852
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
Not a great environment for this sort of thing

853
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
Perspective

854
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,855
Do everything

855
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
Certain amount of

856
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
Showmanship

857
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Appeal

858
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,311
He presents

859
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,359
And there's a little bit of that

860
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,663
Beyond

861
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,271
Like I said as the real action starts

862
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,319
You start to see a shift

863
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
I can save it this summer

864
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Many of these videos

865
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
You know we're like something I like it and I don't

866
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,551
Is it telling me that everybody thicken it

867
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Aw

868
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,135
Isn't depressed

869
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,719
George Bush's Cajun point

870
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Listen to me carefully

871
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Look at me

872
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
I like him

873
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Kim

874
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:45,471
I don't know what happens to a president

875
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,543
Ran for president

876
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,711
Stiff in the mud

877
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
By the way

878
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,063
You know what happens when a lawyer takes Viagra

879
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,903
George Bush has qualities I like

880
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:09,791
Okay first now here's a

881
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
Which was a cattle episode

882
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,655
Pronouncer

883
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
Nuclear

884
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
He said parents wanted to put food on their family

885
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,591
I know that scared me too

886
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:28,991
I'd only imagined them on the secure phone reading the nuclear codes backwards

887
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,831
He's got me doing

888
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
People swim

889
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,119
Barbara Bush

890
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
And a miscarriage in the fetus in a jar

891
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
Love to table difference

892
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:55,359
I don't like his honesty about drinking suggest that he's a dry drunk know he's stopped

893
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
24 years ago

894
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,807
That's admirable his Society with the Charlie Sheen to Lindsay Lohan's spiraling out of control

895
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,111
Never chase women

896
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,903
Compromise National Security by

897
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,231
Opening himself up to Blackmail playing hide the panatela

898
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
Worst president

899
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
That was Franklin Pierce hands down

900
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
As a president

901
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
But I don't kid yourself

902
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:22,495
Obama is exactly the same as a man who would be

903
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,799
Almost as much as the 22nd Amendment

904
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
That's

905
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,503
For someone who ended up as a qanon

906
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Conspiracy theorist

907
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
Find it very strange

908
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,511
Very weird

909
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
Like the idea of like even if you saying

910
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
I'm not saying I like it

911
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
The president but I like the guy

912
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
He's falling into

913
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
To the same store

914
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
Trap

915
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
Now that the W is out of office

916
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
He's a painter

917
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,223
That's falling

918
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,671
Where is before

919
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,255
Which Bush's was over all of the war crimes

920
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
Committed he has every reason

921
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,607
To be like f*** that I'm not

922
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:26,239
Chicago like the guys

923
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:33,407
Cigarette

924
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Because Obama's

925
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,759
Definitely for I mean definitely for non-race relay

926
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
100 +

927
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
When I look at Obama

928
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Cusseta Georgia

929
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
President

930
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
What is a person I don't like

931
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,399
Finger on why

932
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
So far

933
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,311
Overwhelming number videos

934
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
Put out about how George Zimmerman is

935
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,735
Donald Sterling

936
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,295
Westboro Baptist Church

937
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,999
He doesn't like them but they're Crusaders

938
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
I was all nonsense

939
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Exactly like Alex

940
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,847
Yeah yeah yeah more understated

941
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Reports

942
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
There's a temp

943
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,063
Dozen

944
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,135
Wildman

945
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,487
It's pretty watch videos about Zimmerman

946
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,279
So you're the legal take on

947
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
Although there are a lot of other legal case

948
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,655
It'll come out that he could have spent that much time

949
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,239
You know what's weird is

950
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,031
The more I feel like when he

951
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
He was 9

952
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
He Saw My Cousin Vinny's

953
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
This is this is

954
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,927
Groove about 34

955
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,047
You know you talk to that last clip about liking w

956
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
I feel like that's a little hacking

957
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
If you're serious commentator

958
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
You're probably be above that

959
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,775
But then this next clip made me even more can

960
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Concerned

961
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,879
The Chinese book in my time it's a bookstore

962
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,463
Entitled

963
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
In my time

964
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
Is that understood

965
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Coerced

966
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,799
Presidential

967
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
But trust me

968
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,783
But Angie Grace Sundays he will discard well that's no

969
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
So real quick

970
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
We have it the beginning

971
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,367
The presentation of

972
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,975
You sang to me

973
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
It's unconstitutional

974
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
Do snow with boring name

975
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
Let's see where this

976
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:40,031
I didn't either.

977
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
International image

978
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
That being said

979
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,199
Play mr. certitude in his decisiveness

980
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Lip

981
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,807
RoR

982
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
Hi mrs. refusal to equivocate

983
00:55:54,367 --> 00:56:00,511
When you get the decider made up their mind

984
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,351
Bush hamdan

985
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
Stanford

986
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
Probably perhaps

987
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
You've got to give

988
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,087
He's scared that

989
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
Just like you wanted

990
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
Mr. Potter

991
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
Believe me

992
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,823
And it comes in handy

993
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
You know

994
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
I wouldn't do that if I were you

995
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,687
I don't think Dick Cheney would appreciate that

996
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
First NASA tell Joe Biden

997
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,623
44 President Obama's going to read you the Riot Act

998
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
As long as it's

999
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
Love it

1000
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
I don't care what you think

1001
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,887
He was being interviewed about

1002
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,799
The horse you could even get it out

1003
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,823
No big deal

1004
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
Vice president

1005
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
I wasn't

1006
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
Whatever

1007
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,039
Play Store I mean finish

1008
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,623
Jumper cables

1009
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Rihanna

1010
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Hey juicy

1011
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
I understand he's trying to be funny

1012
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,143
I leave a tiny bit of

1013
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
This is all satire

1014
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,727
But I don't think it is

1015
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,567
Because the talking points about Obama and the teleprompter Arkham City

1016
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,407
Ineffectual

1017
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
He's consistent

1018
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
Bucky's Express

1019
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
Underneath a lot of that attempt

1020
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,087
Is something that I believe you sincerely are

1021
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,927
The world is afraid of

1022
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,463
Which is not

1023
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,023
Should argue

1024
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Is there a serious

1025
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
That's not good analysis

1026
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
That is very very bad

1027
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
When stupid people used

1028
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
They were right

1029
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,823
Do things without any kind of

1030
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,591
Pre analysis

1031
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
Whatsoever in

1032
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Just kind of

1033
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
Really get s***

1034
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,967
Done

1035
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
It was work

1036
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,183
Millions of people killed by Stevie worried about like or phrase efficient

1037
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,743
See if its efficiency towards a goal he's again

1038
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,535
Like what is that

1039
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
That makes

1040
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,583
07

1041
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
Victor's internal inconsistent

1042
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
There's so many of these reports

1043
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,191
Because I think they're

1044
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Like an attempt to

1045
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Interesting

1046
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Temptress Vaughn

1047
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,103
Points that are very poorly thought-through

1048
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
And that is exactly what you'd expect

1049
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
Mike just

1050
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
Well of course of course

1051
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
With that kind

1052
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Dumb

1053
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
Look up

1054
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:09,183
To Trump in your life

1055
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
It's kind of interesting that

1056
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Sing right now

1057
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Is of course just

1058
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Picture reaction

1059
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
There is a certain part of us that

1060
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
You know

1061
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Like when people

1062
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,295
A certain part of everybody

1063
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,343
Oh now we have somebody who's

1064
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
Just going to find

1065
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,183
Not we have

1066
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
To constantly be vigil

1067
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Just going to

1068
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Yo

1069
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
Cut through all the b*******

1070
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
We all want to cut through all the red tape

1071
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
What do you play

1072
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
Statistics

1073
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,055
Cut through it

1074
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
Done it does exist all over the

1075
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
Feeds into

1076
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
To each other from both sides

1077
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
I just think

1078
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,551
Easier is it was the order of the day

1079
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,087
Because at this point

1080
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
The election is already

1081
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,719
Paul's not going anywhere

1082
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
The Ron Paul Revolution

1083
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
Have some sort of an idea that

1084
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Ron is going to

1085
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
I'll be the guy

1086
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,935
Hands up retiring

1087
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,519
Is it

1088
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Potential

1089
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Here is gone

1090
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
You do when you're lying

1091
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
Basically just

1092
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,063
Libertarian-leaning establish

1093
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,111
What is

1094
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,647
You hearken towards the strong

1095
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
Strongman

1096
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
Because

1097
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,999
You're so dissatisfied with Obama

1098
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
It's

1099
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Easiest cheapest

1100
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Route to

1101
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,607
Having a position

1102
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
So that's what he does

1103
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Is that right

1104
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Do you know that that's the

1105
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Position

1106
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
He was into

1107
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Consistent

1108
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Globalist

1109
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,919
And I will say

1110
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
Videos

1111
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
Put out about

1112
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Defending

1113
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
To be on the right side of that

1114
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,207
Apartment today

1115
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Like fat shaming

1116
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,023
I think that those things

1117
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,727
I couldn't get my I couldn't get a handle on that

1118
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
It is a position was

1119
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,871
If I was going to

1120
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Gas without

1121
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
Any knowledge of what

1122
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
He said

1123
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,343
A little bit of a vocabulary show

1124
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,695
Greek mythology exactly

1125
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
He's doing that thing where he's

1126
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Stronger

1127
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
So I wanted around

1128
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
If it does feel like

1129
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,527
I mean you've already pointed this out of it earlier

1130
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
You're projecting

1131
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Lame

1132
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,695
Comedies bad

1133
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
The perspective is

1134
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
You talk about

1135
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,071
Now I want to say

1136
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:29,887
Overture

1137
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Romanticize

1138
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
Cast of

1139
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
Of course liking bush

1140
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
Like that

1141
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
4 second

1142
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407

You still is a man who knows his

1144
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:57,791
Mayor Bloomberg

1145
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
The subway

Necessary incarcerate

1149
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,879
These practitioners

1150
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,975
Who insist upon wearing my existence

1151
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
The backpack

1152
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
That's just a huge oversized Sherpa like lawn mower size bundles that people strapped

1153
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:41,567
The rules of football backpacks

1154
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,383
No problem

1155
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:51,295
Stop

1156
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,367

1160
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,199
Nobody is keeping it in the news Dan it's got to stay in the news cycle

1161
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,295
You got ahold

1162
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,743
I got it but he just ran out of time to get the report together for that and forgot he'd already covered

1163
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:39,167
What in the f*** the same script

1164
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,191
Different synonym

1165
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
Even at this point when

1166
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,847
You started to take this

1167
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Pivot

1168
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
I mean

1169
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Conservative

1170
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
Nonsense

1171
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,295
The train

1172
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Back on just

1173
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Keeps going that direction

1174
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
You'll see in this next

1175
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
Stuff that is just

1176
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:09,119
Independable level he's taking attorney now

1177
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
Words

1178
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
These

1179
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
Weird

1180
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,031
Globalism and Ron Paul apologetic

1181
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Like soda

1182
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Positions that are weird

1183
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
He started

1184
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
You say things that are like

1185
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:34,719
Presentation was a distraction

1186
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,055
Caracol

1187
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,151
Horst Ortega presidential election

1188
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,943
Bacon is irrelevant

1189
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,039
I mean

1190
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,647
What did did immediately talk about

1191
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:08,511
Because it was something they could

1192
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,799
I just said we Parson reverse-engineer

1193
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:30,271
I just you need series

1194
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
Ryan's app

1195
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:51,007
Distraction

1196
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,567
Trying to associate

1197
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
Idiocy

1198
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:59,711
Rodney Ryan to gopong the Angelika

1199
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
Seriously

1200
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,327
Facebook

1201
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,911
You're a typical National League

1202
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,191
Stove

1203
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,007
I'm an American League true blue

1204
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
What does that have to do with anything

1205
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:31,455
Here's where the argument Falls Apartment PDX there exactly

1206
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:37,343
And the other one difference between the National and American League

1207
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,975
Your attempt to minimize reductio ad absurdum argument falls apart

1208
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
Dumb dumb

1209
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
What kind of

1210
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
Nationally

1211
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,911
That's where we are today

1212
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,983
We've distilled reduce the argument to person

1213
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,775
Bumper sticker Playbook argument

1214
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
The World Monetary systems are on the verge of collapse

1215
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:05,247
We are on our way to end

1216
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
Tomorrow

1217
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
I told him

1218
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:21,631
And yet these

1219
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
Giving you

1220
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
As you speak

1221
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
I will

1222
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
So what are you doing

1223
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,431
Really important client

1224
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Because he's covering it

1225
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
Right here is like

1226
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,367
First of all he's not taking into account

1227
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,159
Can cover multiple stories simultaneously

1228
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,559
Employee

1229
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,863
Can't get the bigger thing

1230
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
Good examples that he's talking about here like

1231
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,471
Economy collapse

1232
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,495
Stuff like that

1233
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
He is the one who is guilty of not covering those things in favor of talking about.

1234
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
To dismiss this

1235
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
Todd Akin

1236
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,783
Legitimate rape doesn't cause pregnancy

1237
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
These nonsense

1238
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Now the bigger issue is

1239
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
Conflated with

1240
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,207
Like the tea party and stuff like that

1241
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Isn't

1242
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,303
Irresponsible because he's a member of the Tea Party

1243
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,119
The other thing is that his

1244
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Statement

1245
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,935
Weren't condemned by the

1246
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
People on the right

1247
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Maybe a couple people

1248
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
But generally speaking

1249
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,615
People much like with Nazis

1250
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,455
Just started like

1251
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,247
That's sort of the thing

1252
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,903
He was a member of the House of Representatives like it is relevant

1253
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,767
It's elected official with a

1254
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,815
These are when they're this

1255
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
Misogynistic

1256
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,655
About both of your shoes of abortion

1257
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,191
Great it is very

1258
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,775
There's no point in talking

1259
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,335
It's not like he has

1260
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,615
He does

1261
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:12,223
I should tell you that

1262
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,295
I got bad news about the house

1263
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,087
It's very

1264
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
It's not a distraction

1265
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,159
This is abstract

1266
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
This is this is distracted

1267
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
You from

1268
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
The idea of

1269
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
What today

1270
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,375
I'd like what

1271
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
That every person

1272
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
It's not to say that every

1273
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Conservative

1274
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,103
On somebody

1275
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,383
You probably up till that

1276
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
Didn't say anything like that

1277
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:46,271
To be a normal run-of-the-mill considered anti-abortion

1278
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
It gives you what you

1279
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,927
Just be like at least a couple other people who

1280
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
And that's really f***** up

1281
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
It's also really f***** up have you apologized

1282
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Lost

1283
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,167
Claire mccaskill later wrote a book

1284
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,383
Most

1285
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
Yeah

1286
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,111
Nuts but this is

1287
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,231
Going out of their way

1288
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
Interference

1289
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
In Subway

1290
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
About conserving

1291
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Who do things that are

1292
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Really horrible

1293
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
Just political

1294
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
It's it's like

1295
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
And this is

1296
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,055
Sing that I think a lot of

1297
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
White people

1298
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
As they get older

1299
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,895
Like they ride them minor in

1300
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
Inconvenience train

1301
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
White supremacy

1302
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
Oh you bet

1303
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
It's not going to be

1304
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,791
Owl

1305
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
And of course that's why why

1306
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,375
I need to break away from

1307
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
Natural

1308
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,495
It's all about the bass

1309
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,775
Everything else is

1310
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Distraction

1311
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,455
Clearly

1312
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Of your own show

1313
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,623
Also everytime it

1314
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,439
If Eddie like photoshopped

1315
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
Take the Lionel theme song

1316
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,743
And just

1317
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
The Zelda

1318
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
Villain bad guy

1319
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:41,215
Make a video of

1320
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:44,799
Vinyl dancing with a mariachi band

1321
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,127
That's all that goes through my head but I

1322
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
The next

1323
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,199
Clifford

1324
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:11,679
Chaz Bono going to explain to him

1325
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Information with Chaz Bono

1326
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
You know what's interesting

1327
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,823
He said please

1328
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,615
You don't need to because

1329
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,639
The end of the clip

1330
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,223
He will invalidate everything he said during the clip

1331
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
And makeup

1332
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
What the fascination

1333
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:36,255
Being amusing words

1334
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
He's just being

1335
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,583
Intentionally obtuse

1336
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
As an interest

1337
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
Chaz Bono

1338
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:54,943
Female-to-male gender transition

1339
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,223
He doesn't miss gendered

1340
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,855
Of this elk probably would

1341
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,719
Hero 2000

1342
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:19,775
Sexuality and gender identity

1343
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
That means

1344
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,127
I'm starting to get sick

1345
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
She come around

1346
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
Heineken

1347
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
I guess

1348
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:43,327
Baby I get bored easily

1349
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
He gets bored easily

1350
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,887
He did over

1351
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:50,495
Videos about George Zimmerman being cool

1352
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,543
Maybe

1353
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
I'm the only person

1354
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,223
Who actually couldn't care less

1355
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,807
This isn't one of those

1356
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:09,439
There are more important issues lectures I'm a fan of pop culture

1357
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,999
But the question that I like

1358
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,839
That I know you would ask on faces

1359
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:20,703
You want to know that my friend Judy Gold at her new one-woman shows

1360
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Why is

1361
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,799
Chaz so fat

1362
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,383
Reconstruction

1363
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
Accurately Construction

1364
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223
That I want

1365
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
A pretty straightforward

1366
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
Pun

1367
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,559
The guts encouraged part I can't emphasize

1368
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,959
There are transgender

1369
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,055
Glitter lyrics

1370
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,639
Brandon P nothing comes to mind

1371
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Give Jenny Craig

1372
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Who's

1373
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
Carrie Fisher with her ezt electroshock

1374
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,327
Okay

1375
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,055
Isn't that interesting there at the end talking about how like

1376
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
Your chats has a large

1377
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,503
Platform as a celebrity

1378
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,623
The clip with such an invalid

1379
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
CID

1380
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,743
Sick and tired of seeing Chad Bono route

1381
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
He makes clear that he understands

1382
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
Very valuable

1383
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:59,007
In small-town America who is representative of

1384
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,031
Make

1385
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
Making them feel normal

1386
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
For him to pretend

1387
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,383
The keys like I'm totally

1388
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Fine

1389
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,479
People I'm not against that at all

1390
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,783
But f*** this representation thing

1391
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Edwards

1392
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
I don't like it

1393
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,559
Because it doesn't affect me

1394
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
Because for the people

1395
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
It's actually very important

1396
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
But

1397
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,239
People being fat

1398
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,567
I don't understand I really don't like

1399
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
If I were the segments

1400
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,663
Producer on the show and he submitted this is

1401
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
I would be like

1402
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,551
There's internal problems yourself very least

1403
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
You let make

1404
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,855
We're at the end

1405
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,463
Do you know exactly what

1406
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,327
And aware of

1407
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,631
Figure it in pop culture

1408
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,495
Trans rights and acceptance

1409
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
You're pretending

1410
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,103
Perhaps Perhaps the end of this undercuts your point

1411
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:07,871
I would

1412
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,407
Go to a page-one rewrite

1413
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,199
Recast

1414
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Embarrassing

1415
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
Pramod comedy

1416
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Perspective

1417
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,183
From a human perspective

1418
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
From a point

1419
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Perspective

1420
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
From a

1421
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Writing

1422
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,071
Everything about that

1423
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
Bad

1424
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
Yeah I don't know

1425
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,679
So that's interesting that we have Chaz Bono

1426
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,727
This is his take

1427
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
That's great

1428
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
His take on him

1429
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,639
Super awesome that a trans person

1430
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,711
Coming out

1431
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,271
People find it inspirational and

1432
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,855
And we are talking about

1433
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,671
Insomuch also helps normalize trans

1434
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Comfortable

1435
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,375
Ever made you feel comfortable because finally

1436
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911
This pop culture

1437
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,191
Is being transmitted

1438
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:09,567
Making them feel more comfortable with the idea

1439
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
But also

1440
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,175
Jenny Craig needs to again

1441
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
Like I really can't

1442
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,623
Understand

1443
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,415
Like where his

1444
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,767
Because he does have a number of videos about how bullies are bad

1445
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,375
They're committing a bad thing

1446
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
To bullying

1447
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,423
And the idea that

1448
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,703
K2

1449
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Bad

1450
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,847
Would be not a difficult argument to make what he's doing there

1451
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,199
It's a little bit

1452
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:51,039
Also

1453
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,623
Feeling uncomfortable in their own skin

1454
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
Afraid of coming out to there

1455
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
To his parents

1456
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,791
Afraid of

1457
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,583
What do you think that person

1458
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
Idea it

1459
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
It's just them

1460
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
He talks about Chaz Bono

1461
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,176
Who's differences

1462
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:31,488
You notice how immediately after

1463
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,304
Right-wing group

1464
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
This is dangerous

1465
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:46,848
Absolutely are

1466
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,736
First expansion

1467
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,528
Singular sick of it

01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,576
Message

1469
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:07,840

Politico

1472
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,568
We're giving Quick Remote

1473
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,640
What Charles Manson orchestrated the tate-labianca murders

1474
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,040
Cuz he said

1475
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,856
A white supremacist or a fallen left

1476
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,520
In addition to Independence

1477
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,920
Democratic and Republican Administration

1478
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,968

Domestic terrorism

1480
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,832
Islamofascism an oxymoron

1481
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:06,720
Empower

1482
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:13,120
Right

1483
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
Malicious

1484
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
Are the danger

1485
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:32,064
The more that these discussions go from the Norway

1486
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:38,464
His support of the English Defence League

1487
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,096
Similarity to our tea party

1488
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,168
Conflation and expansion

1489
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:53,568
Then leave to some weird kind of transitive property application

1490
01:22:54,080 --> 01:23:00,224
Our political

1491
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,808
That's exactly what's happening

1492
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Whatever

1493
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
Don't let the heart

1494
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
That's what you're doing

1495
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
He won't even stay a brother's name

1496
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,408
He won't even acknowledge that talk about the real way

1497
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,992
And if you want to if you want to hear more about

1498
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,784
Episode

1499
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
Anders Breivik

1500
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:39,904
Is that

1501
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,464
Lionel has never read his Manifesto

1502
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,072
Understanding exactly what motivated

1503
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,352
To do the things he did

1504
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
Because they are so close

1505
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,424
Do the same

1506
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
That do inspired

1507
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,752
Malaysia cinta right-wing AT-AT

1508
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,336
Pity party

1509
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:02,432
Anti-muslim sentiments

1510
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
In what motivated

1511
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,576
I do understand what you saying in terms of

1512
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,184
This guy is representative of all of us

1513
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,840
Point well-taken is affairs

1514
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,168
We can have that conversation

1515
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,520
What it's like a brevik is indicative of

1516
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
The mainstream of

1517
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
Conservatism

1518
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
But

1519
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Why somebody did something

1520
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:40,064
Is irrelevant a I'm afraid of looking at

1521
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,344
Because it will

1522
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,136
Unveil Andrew Steele

1523
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
How

1524
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208

1525
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
Anti-immigrant

1526
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,024
Thinking

1527
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
Left

1528
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
To their own devices

1529
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
And take him to the

1530
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,656
End up in

1531
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,448
Why don't we

1532
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
You killed people

1533
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,264
The end result

1534
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
Of this line

1535
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
Just is

1536
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,664
He's a crazy person

1537
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,480
His motivations that doesn't matter

1538
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
It is almost like

1539
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,856
Terrorist

1540
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,208
Matter

1541
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,488
Cuz they're crazy

1542
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,024
They're just nuts

1543
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
You can't

1544
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
There

1545
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,656
Manifest

1546
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,192
Play the same s*** that I say all the

1547
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,984
SB

1548
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,616
Terrorist

1549
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,736
Because there's Lomb is so horrible

1550
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,320
Or conversely with this world

1551
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,112
Cuz they don't even want

1552
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,184
That's all folks

1553
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,976
Or whatever

1554
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,512
Something like this

1555
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
This clip

1556
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,352
Is interesting

1557
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,912
Because he's talking about Anders Breivik like this

1558
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,216
Yeah after he talked about Chaz Bono

1559
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,032
This is actually more akin to the

1560
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Avatar

1561
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
Don't associate

1562
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,480
I will take no ownership of the idea that

1563
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,016
This is very close

1564
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,856
I absolutely will not look

1565
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
At The Logical

1566
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,952
Conclusion of all of the stuff that I say in

1567
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
Because my doing that

1568
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,072
See you that it would inspire

1569
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,472
Motivation

1570
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,264
Eco-terrorists

1571
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Like for sure animal rights

1572
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Terrorists

1573
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,872
Important to look at their motivation

1574
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,408
Understand what

1575
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,712
I have no idea

1576
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,808
Motivated by

1577
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Principal

1578
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,672
Maybe

1579
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
To Pharr Event

1580
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,536
This is just a shutting down

1581
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,888
Because of the fear of what it could

1582
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
Like you live

1583
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
What's under there

1584
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,520
I think it's sad I think it's a very

1585
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Cowardly

1586
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
Typo

1587
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,104
A place to live

1588
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,432
More or less

1589
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:17,760
Which is why I wanted to cover this stuff

1590
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,856
This is more like

1591
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,904
This is the career that Lionel

1592
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,672
Living

1593
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
This is what you put in

1594
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,768
Large chunk of

1595
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
He's creepy

1596
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
100%

1597
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,376
Quite frankly

1598
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,656
And at the same time

1599
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,448
Qanon

1600
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Knew that this

1601
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,264
Is the guy who you're now all like

1602
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
Take a step back and

1603
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
Think about what you're

1604
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
Like

1605
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,176
Your intellectual Heroes

1606
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
Whitwell

1607
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,992
We all get very bored

1608
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:54,112
Ibloom

1609
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
10

1610
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Thousand

1611
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,720
Sealed indictments coming and everybody wears

1612
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:01,024
Hillary's going to prison bushes

1613
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,304
100%

1614
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
Bush

1615
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:06,144
Sick and tired of exercise equipment absolute

1616
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,008
Swear to God

1617
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
So

1618
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
Oh yeah

1619
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Actually

1620
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
You say it is best to get for listening to

1621
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,784
Too much of this

1622
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,576
Early on

1623
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,880
Lionel had that video

1624
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,160
You was talking about

1625
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,696
You show proof

1626
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
About

1627
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,744
His

1628
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
That Obama

1629
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
Wasn't

1630
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
In the country

1631
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,216
Election

1632
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,240
No

01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,288
The well on Trump's birthday

1634
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,552
Donald Trump is my new hero

1635
01:28:55,808 --> 01:29:01,952
Never really been a fan before I give her

1636
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,256
Only person who really knows and cares

1637
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
Being sad

1638
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,864
Maybe he's driving.

1639
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:15,264
Dairy

1640
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,432
What I saw CNN permanently comatose

01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,880
Wolf Blitzer

01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672

President eligibility specifically

1645
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,816
Estimate natural-born

1646
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:45,216
Release his birth certificate

1647
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,568
Who I swear died in 1978

Wolf spiders

1649
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
How to remember

Ever see anyone ever

1651
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,016
Any embarrassing

1652
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,856
Think about it during the Clinton years

Paddle

1654
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:10,816

Or really anyone in the media

1658
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:28,480
Why Trump crazy

1659
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,344
For he's a racist or whatever

Solutely mandatory

1661
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,328
Presidential Scholars my

1662
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:48,192
Recall that there were questions

1663
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
Real

1664
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,336
Prior to his election had spent some time abroad

1665
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:59,200

14 years cumulative

1667
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696

And I love

1673
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
As you

1674
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,624
Not a lot of laughter in the studio

1675
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,232
She has a job.

1676
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
There's a couple of

1677
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,864
Important

1678
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,912
Declared hair jokes dead

1679
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,936
He did two of them

1680
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,496
Maximum

1681
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,848
By your own rules

1682
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,128
Jokes

1683
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,176
You have transgressed your own rule

1684
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,456
No second

1685
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,248
Nothing really changed

1686
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,808
In terms of Donald Trump's birtherism

1687
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,600
And the intervening

1688
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Years between these clips

1689
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,464
Nothing on the ground had changed

1690
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
And

1691
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
Nothing really

1692
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
Perspective

1693
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,584
In the first clip use like

1694
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,632
You have no evidence

1695
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,936
You got to stop at SoDo I'm thrilled you're making

1696
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,960
Chris Matthews

1697
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:28,032
Right what's motivating clip is there wolf

1698
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,312
Blitzer is now mad about

1699
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
There is no subs

1700
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
Different

1701
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,384
Except for

1702
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
I don't know what it is

1703
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
I have no idea

1704
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,576
But something changed

1705
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
Completely flipped

1706
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:43,904
Disposition

1707
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
On something

1708
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,208
2 point where he's like

1709
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:51,584
It's like Trump is questioning the birth

1710
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:55,168
You made a video being mad about them questioning the Versa

1711
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,240
Like I what you're condemning your past

1712
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:02,592
Self without calling yourself a I would know I was even

1713
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
Stupid

1714
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,712
This is indicative

1715
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
Absolute

1716
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,040
Something behind the scenes

1717
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:16,160
I don't know what it is Ron Paul's retirement

1718
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,512
That alone could

1719
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,536
Account for a great

1720
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,608
It's something and it's

1721
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
That's all I

1722
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
I don't know.

1723
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,616
Because

1724
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
You just sound like

1725
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,688
He's getting crankier and let's

1726
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,320
It doesn't seem like he's enjoying himself at all giving

1727
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,416
If you listen to a bunch of his stuff

1728
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
She doesn't seem

1729
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,464
He doesn't have a lot of

1730
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,144
She said that earlier

1731
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,424
Should be right

1732
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Pillory

1733
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,216
For your

1734
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Be funny when you

1735
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,800
So there

1736
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,568
Hans

1737
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,920
These are the ones that I thought

1738
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
Overtime

1739
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
Of Lionel

1740
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
Career at work

1741
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
Yeah now it should be noted that

1742
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,440
2011

1743
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Here is

1744
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
First Energy

1745
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,864
So this is his last clip

1746
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,888
That we just played

1747
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
Rvhs

1748
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
2013

1749
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
2014

1750
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
So

1751
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,896
2 years prior to that

1752
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,432
Isn't super important necessarily

1753
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,968
Play for this

1754
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,064
This is before the re-election right

1755
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
Pyramid

1756
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,440
America.

1757
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Rin that place

1758
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
I think this

1759
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,768
It should speak volumes

1760
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
About why

1761
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,136
Tangled

1762
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:30,048
There is not one show is not one day that goes by

1763
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,192
Number 12

1764
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:42,848
Where are the mainstream media where are these narcotized

1765
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:49,248
How many hours

1766
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:01,792
But if you want to run and listen to local media news

1767
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,864
In front of everybody in full View

1768
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:11,264
Those are the stories

1769
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,408
You do it

1770
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,952
So

1771
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
Pickaboo

1772
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:37,632
Ill about you see is infected

1773
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:41,472
Thrombosis

1774
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,752
Christ

1775
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
I am

1776
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,848
You see here is

1777
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Someone

1778
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,784
It's hard to say I actually have very strong

1779
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,112
Elizabeth etics

1780
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Con man

1781
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
Okay

1782
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
I think he is marginal

1783
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,816
Something usually hack

1784
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:11,168
Very large market for Paterson

1785
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,192
Well I mean

1786
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:15,008
Even Beyond him if you just go to rike Road

1787
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,872
Because they're on the right

1788
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,176
And middle-of-the-road stuff.

1789
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,968
Kind of boring to anyone

1790
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,552
He isn't very

1791
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,576
What

1792
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,112
Unfortunately this is

1793
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,488
But

1794
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,768
Is the white

1795
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
Baby cats

1796
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,120
Catch more fish that way the lowest common denominator

1797
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:51,616
Troglodyte

1798
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,576
Talk radio is blank

1799
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,904
Tibet scam after

1800
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,000
Realized

1801
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:09,024
Law is hot

1802
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,792
Flirting

1803
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,584
Interested in hearing these legal opinions

1804
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,632
And stuff like that I have a log

1805
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,936
Degree from a bad College I'm going to

1806
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
This game

1807
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,496
Leestown Tatnuck

1808
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
With the word

1809
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,032
That I can

1810
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,080
Do that

1811
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,360
Be charming and

1812
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
You got into that

1813
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
As you got it

1814
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,528
Local access

1815
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,136
News does hackey washed over warmed up comedy

1816
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:35,904
Regine

1817
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,720
I wouldn't be surprised if there is an echo

1818
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,560
Moonlighted going to open mic

1819
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
In New York

1820
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,864
And just writing down friend

1821
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,448
Not equality

1822
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,240
So he does that

1823
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,336
Not working out all that

1824
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,128
Gets involved in Aramaic

1825
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:01,248
Maybe in some ways responsible for hair America falling apart

1826
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,808
Because of them turning their back on Sam Cedar and making it

1827
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,576
Sunday only

1828
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,648
And when are America falls apart

1829
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,416
She's kind of life

1830
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,488
I have a talk radio show

1831
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Makes a pivot

1832
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
He interpreted

1833
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
Yeah at the time that is

1834
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,960
Anti-obama

1835
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,752
And in some ways

1836
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:23,776
Glorifying

1837
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
Bush

1838
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,848
Anti youth

1839
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,992
Now you still has the Ron Paul background

1840
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:35,040
Already

1841
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,856
Bear

1842
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,136
Him to start getting involved

1843
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,440
Absolutely

1844
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,464
Weather

1845
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,744
It's because he recognized

1846
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,560
Or whatever

1847
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,096
He becomes radicalized

1848
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
He starts to go down harder

1849
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,192
With Alex

1850
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,496
His video city starts putting out on you

1851
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,520
YouTube r

1852
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,824
More hardcore

1853
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,920
From him and a news Studio.

1854
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:04,224
To him in his office

1855
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:10,112
Apetor a bit more extreme

1856
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Track

1857
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,024
You still look

1858
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
These numbers

1859
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,584
Videos that he has

1860
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,656
Of him doing this

1861
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
Hundred

1862
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
Yes

1863
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:29,056
It's minuscule the number of use these

1864
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Ever got

1865
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,616
And when he started Broadcasting

1866
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
Videos on

1867
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:37,760
Still only like

1868
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,136
They've been online for five years yet

1869
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,440
As soon as he pivoted to

1870
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,744
As soon as you started doing

1871
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
It's now in the 50

1872
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,328
Thousand hundred thousand

1873
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
He took a

1874
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,144
Massive jump

1875
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
And I think

1876
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:56,960
I think it's the pass

1877
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:59,520
I think he's always been looking

1878
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,288
4

1879
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,568
Better

1880
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,104
Cod battered

1881
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
He found

1882
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,456
What's going on

1883
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,248
The dude who is just always been looking

1884
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,808
Keep jumping from

1885
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Trying to

1886
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
Find it's like somebody

1887
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,928
Trying to move their way up

1888
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
The corporate ladder

1889
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
Pretending

1890
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,496
Trying to get up the ladder or whatever

1891
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,288
But I think

1892
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
Probably

1893
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,872
Is that the latter leads to

1894
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,552
Position on the lower rungs of the ladder

1895
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
It's not that hard

1896
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
You can have

1897
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
Poorly thoughts

1898
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,904
Through hockey positions

1899
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,440
And maybe still Coast

1900
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,208
Through

1901
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:52,256
As you go higher up the ladder

1902
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
Become

1903
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Like

1904
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
Malicious propaganda

1905
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Congruent

1906
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,448
So I don't know I don't I don't know I don't know how

1907
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,056
This was an attempt

1908
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
I believe

1909
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
Wholeheartedly

1910
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,432
It was I want

1911
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,968
You're on something

1912
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
You could just laugh bunch of out

1913
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
And still have some

1914
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
Hey this is all stupid

1915
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,208
The laughing

1916
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,744
So I think we

1917
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,560
A small point

1918
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
About how

1919
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
He is also

1920
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
To start the new year

1921
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,496
I feel like we missed last

1922
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
With RC

1923
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,336
Secretive 22nd

1924
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:50,624
Thank you all for joining us

1925
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,904
It's been a great

1926
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:59,072
Of year so far

1927
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:07,264
It is

1928
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,824
I will soar on Twitter

1929
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,064
Absolutely we're on eyeliner

1930
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,160
Leave review, review

1931
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,232
God I could do that all day

1932
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,280
So

1933
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,072
Hertz

1934
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:36,448
I love it so much bad and it's so annoying

1935
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,496
Good

1936
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,080
So much

1937
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,360
Icarus

1938
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,896
Humorous of that

1939
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,760
I'm going to show you as soon as

1940
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:54,880
According to the video

1941
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,696
Fake yelling in a bowl

1942
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,488
If crazy

1943
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,512
Everyone looking up

1944
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:04,864
No good

1945
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,656
Next time

1946
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
Until then

1947
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Indeed

1948
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:13,824
Don't think I've ever killed

1949
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
True

1950
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,384
I think I think the chances are Slim

1951
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,016
Technically

1952
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,040
And that's all

1953
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:31,488
