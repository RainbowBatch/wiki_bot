00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:09,472
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:15,872
We had a little hitch there

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Don't know what's going on in my head

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
Alright podcast professionalism

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
Cut this out and redo the intro

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:34,816
God damn do that now you're calling me out after split

7
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,352
Stutter

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168

00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
What's the round-trip novelty beverages

10
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
You know everything about

00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Pretty much

12
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
I don't know anything

13
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
There's another one of the bottles of juice

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
Very tired

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
Which is the whole point of getting this

16
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
So tired that I dropped

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
This is excuses

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
I forget the coconut juice and now I forget this

19
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,056
It is organic

20
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Hibiscus

21
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
It's a Chia Vitality colloidal

22
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Disgusting look

23
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
Okay

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
To take this out dropper by dropper and put it underneath

25
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,536
I agree I think so

26
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,352
This is the Alex Jones beverage

27
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
The fiber I'm going to take a sip of this

28
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Oh my God

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
I don't want to try this

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,688
It tastes good but

31
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
It seems to me like a drinking yogurt

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
Just swallow it

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,000
Not chance

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
You have to get you

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
You to swallow your tongue

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Seeds every time

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Hindu

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
Anyways

39
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
It's it's like tiny boba

40
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
June 23rd 27th

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
Episode of The Alex Jones Show

42
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Oh boy

43
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
The president's been going on

44
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
Skip

45
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
Last week of listening to him in the present

46
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
Megan Kelly interview I was like

47
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
I don't want to listen to him brag

48
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,592
I don't want to listen to gloat for a week about the main stream media

49
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
Until I retreated

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
The 2015

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,712
Right time in my studies of 2015

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
As opposed to listen to him jack himself off on the air

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
However we got to check in

54
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
See what's going on

55
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Guy

56
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
I checked in today

57
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
And recording is on Tuesday

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
Owen Shroyer

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,216
Summer and they were talking about the CNN video

60
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
I'm assuming that

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,384
It got a name like James O'Keefe behind it it's either

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
Painting of a vagina flower or it is b*******

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
It is

64
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
That there isn't any evidence of trump

65
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Russia collusion

66
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Higher-ups

67
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
Are pushing those stories because of rating

68
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
Made it to James O'Keefe production

69
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,448
You know this when he's involved

70
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,776
Project Veritas is involved it's not true

71
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Is justice

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Good through-line

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
So

74
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Alex called and talked about how

75
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
James O'Keefe has just

76
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Killed

77
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
Alex is calling into the show.

78
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
And I can hear tropical birds in the background

79
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
So I'm sure he's on a vacation he's not

80
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
Calling a

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
I went back to Monday

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Mission to stay exactly

83
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Do birds learn to talk

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Spoiler alert

85
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Talkative

86
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
What if you yell globalist of the tropical bird what happened

87
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Empirical Studies have shown

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
They are globalist

89
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
So who trained them to y'all globalist

90
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,111
It's obviously Soros exactly money

91
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Turn soros's going into tropical

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
First thing that they say

93
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,679
Introduce each other

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,751
Short valisure Japanese Global absolutely

95
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
Respectful of course me what you do is

96
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
If you

97
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Go up to a bird

98
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
And you say globalist and it says globalist

99
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
No big deal

100
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
But if you go if you go to a bird and its globalist first

101
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
That means you're close to one of their word out

102
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,231
Okay there are murdered out cuz it's already

103
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,583
That makes the least amount of sense of anything I've ever heard in my entire life

104
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
I'm thinking of the dream-quest of unknown

105
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Cadet

106
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
The Lovecraft

107
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,335
Echocardiogram

108
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
Today

109
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Well good to be back

110
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
So I went to Mondays episodes

111
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
You see what's going on there

112
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Steve Alex

113
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Was there or if he's been gone

114
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
He was gone it was Owen Shroyer hosting

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,999
Episode for us to cover

116
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
Sunday

117
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Right so I go back to Friday

119
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
This is Friday 23rd

120
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
2017 we're going to be covering

121
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,567
Discovered in the first hour of the show

122
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Lunacy

123
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Hellboy

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
Really irresponsible and very dangerous

125
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
And maybe not as funny as I want this to be in there

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,207
But I listen to the whole thing and you know he doesn't interview with a guy named Max Keiser

127
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Is another one of his

128
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Faulty intellectual

129
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
The economic

130
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
You know he has his Gerald

131
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Valente's and

132
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Harry dent

133
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
Peter Schiff

134
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,799
These types

135
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
You come in and tell everybody that says it's about to go bad

136
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
The real twist

137
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
He's so boring

138
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
But I didn't

139
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,735
Cut any of this

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
This interview

141
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
Ball from the buy gold

142
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855

144
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
What does Max Keiser guy

145
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
What do you also say

146
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Is

147
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Hey

148
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Get my

149
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,679
Now that's a good move right there

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Excel Mac

151
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Coins

152
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
That

153
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
Publix

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
I didn't realize you could just do that

155
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Worth something like $0.20

156
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
But it

157
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Came up from like

158
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Be that as it may

159
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
If you responsible to sell gold

160
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,031
Get on your show when you're fear-mongering about an economic collapse

161
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
It's very irresponsible to tell your own currency

162
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
I know but

163
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,479
That's I love it I love it

164
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271

Yeah now it's like coins coming soon

00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
I'll look into it

167
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
I don't want I don't want to make my own economy

168
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Like a lot of work

169
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
Camarones

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
That's what we've always want

171
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,983
Digital money

172
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,359
I just feel like it's more hassle than it's worth and then if someone falls out of knowledge fight coins

173
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
We are responsible for

174
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,783
Screwing over so many people well it was only usable at Disneyland

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Nations in Disney World

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
Look and feel like we lost a lot of money on that traits right

177
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Disney World is

178
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559

179
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239

I'm going to start

182
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
We'll just go exactly where he begins the episode of fun thing whenever I choked

183
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
To death on chia seeds

184
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135

I want to stop there because I

187
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
He says that every day

188
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,991
Well first of all hell's breaking loose.

00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,831
Breeze's it's hard to believe it's already blank.

190
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,927
He says that all the time I kind of think that's Charming on a little that it's kind of like

191
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
A little broadcaster

192
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
All this time has passed

193
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,215
Another Day Has Come and gone and we are still alive and I kind of like it

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
All hell's Breakin loose

195
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
All right you've smelled breaks loose

196
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Switch very fast

197
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,455
He's starting to show what he wants

198
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
They're scared right now

199
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Globalist

200
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Going to start calling Disney World

201
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
Previous records

202
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,471
Each one of the four failed special election since President Trump sworn in on

203
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
January 20th

204
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
2017 from Washington

205
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
The people

206
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
Deliverance in

207
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Royals page

208
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
And the globalist

209
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Russia

210
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,775
Re-entry freakout mode

211
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
35 million

212
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
Special election

213
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
How much are the Republicans Birdsboro

214
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,135
Spoiled brat

215
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
Power

216
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
Is Awakening

217
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,335
Klingon to the host the parasites are in a

218
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Insane

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
That is a run-on sentence

220
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Oh absolutely

221
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,039
I have

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,647
We're just we're just going from okay the globalist

223
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Because they lost four consecutive special election

224
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
HD Democrat

225
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Farro

226
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Performed previous election

227
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,751
Far closer than they should have one of them

228
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Wasn't one of them a bit too

229
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,431
Georgia was the Asif race was very much

230
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Everybody kind of predicted a far better

231
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,391
Yeah but you know you got to pick this other lady who hates gay people

232
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Ya got to do it

233
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
She doesn't think they're real

234
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Fine

235
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Put her in Concord

236
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
I'm trying to find

237
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,375
Just how much the Republic

238
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
Install the Republican Spectrum

239
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Now the problem is

240
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
They have so much

241
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Because their best

242
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Are billionaires

243
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Best friend

244
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,039
Billionaires but not as many

245
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
And Union

246
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
I don't have a whole lot in the coppers

247
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,487
There are a few billionaires

248
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
How did we get to they have our kids

249
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Public School

250
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
What

251
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
I don't know but that's

252
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Betfair last

253
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Chance

254
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
I guess I guess

255
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Maybe

256
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
That doesn't sound like a bad son

257
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
No

258
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
I mean we're full of a lot of bulshit

259
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,119
Straight Out The Gate because he's misleading about all these special elections

260
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
He's not dealing with the fact that like

261
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
If you look at the actual

262
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,519
Statistics on the Republican should be worried

263
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
About the turnout

264
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
About

265
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Results

266
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Even though they want it does indicate

267
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Bad thing

268
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,991
A coming because all of those were heavy

269
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Republican-leaning areas

270
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
D I swear to God

271
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
I've been sitting here I wanted

272
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
I want to listen to the last

273
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
You said replicas

274
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
I know I didn't

275
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
You totally.

276
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
No

277
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
I could not be

278
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,215
Oh my God

279
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
And that

280
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Is my favorite thing to refer to myself

281
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,039
How can you be sure I'm very confused about I might be reading too much Phillips

282
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
That's what the Republicans

283
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
The replicant

284
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
But Alex's high-minded

285
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
He's talking politics he's talking taking our kids

286
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
That episode

287
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
What a meeting

288
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,959
Potato special election

289
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Sims were so close

290
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
And how it's a really is

291
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
A good thing for the Republic

292
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
A-1 Auto

293
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
When you expect

294
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,247
This huge

295
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
They would have lost

296
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
Even that he's going to spend it as you know if you want to look at the truth Republican should have one major

297
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
And all of them

298
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
Light a fire under Republican 2A.

299
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,423
Complacent after the last election

300
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Nope punch

301
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
He does not deal with me

302
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:18,015
A meth head

303
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
What's some other Waterhead

304
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
And they stand up there and talk about how

305
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
A dream about killing the president

306
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,103
Another piece of Filth

307
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
If you don't love it get out

308
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Classic

309
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
There are more countries besides

310
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
North Korea

311
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
The think global global

312
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Yeah probably has houses in Malta

313
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,031
Principal Alex North Korea

314
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Text Billy

315
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Came out

316
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
I'm stuff

317
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Last week

318
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Alex

319
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
Might spend most of his show.

320
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
He is furious

321
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,023
For those of you don't know what Johnny Depp said I will play the clip a little bit later

322
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Labadee

323
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
You saying that

324
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Donald Trump needs help

325
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
He's responding to a question clearly and

326
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
Goes on to say

327
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Practice is it by saying

328
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
This is going to be in the present

329
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
It's going to be terrible

330
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
He says I'm not

331
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
I'm not saying anything

332
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
But when was the last time

333
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
An actor assassinated the president

334
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,655
That's not bad Pizza joke

335
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
It's not a good joke that's not bad at all

336
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
Homeless looking

337
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Which is what you think of when you think Johnny

338
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
He goes on to say I'm not an actor

339
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Ilife

340
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
But you know what it is

341
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
You picking on a lot of

342
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
The traits of Hunter S Thompson

343
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
He has he's using all restaurants in sort of

344
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Younger mannerisms

345
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
He's just acting like Hunter S Thompson

346
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Yeah that's all he's doing for a life

347
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
That would Hunter S Thompson dead

348
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
His spirit

349
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
For good or bad

350
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Seems to live in Johnny Depp

351
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
Hey you do what movie with him in and there you go

352
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
If I had to like trying to that headspace

353
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
To do Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

354
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
Maybe I'll go crazy too

355
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
And maybe that's not the point you went crazy

356
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Beautiful

357
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,999
Like it's a joke it's a dark joke

358
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Plays on the fact

359
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Like I said

360
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
I'm not going to

361
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
Ticket Club

362
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
There's awareness within a

363
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
It's not like a

364
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Threat or anything like that

365
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
He refuses it by saying I'm not an actor

366
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
I'm not saying anything I'm not going to do

367
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Stories about it

368
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
He takes it

369
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Real art

370
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
And we'll get to you some of his reaction

371
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,631
But I think you're a little bit over-the-top

372
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
He gets to an article with Paul Joseph Watson has written

373
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
And he makes a very interesting offer

374
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
To an unknown

375
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Named woman

376
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
Yep some spoiled pension fund government-funded

377
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,047
College scholarship

378
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
First class tickets

379
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
First class tickets

380
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Remove

381
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
One year

382
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Libya

383
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
Are the Siri I'm sorry those are Total War zones Thanksgiving people

384
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,423
Come on without the Pay-Per-View

385
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
Muslim

386
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
Muslims

387
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
Globalist minions

388
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,511
Daughters

389
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Anna Sun

390
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,423
North Korea

391
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Invaders

392
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,511
Play the end

393
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Horrible end

394
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
To that

395
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
That piece

396
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Chunk

397
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Vets

398
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
To be heard.

399
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
That was the most

400
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
The cost of living in Saudi Arabia

401
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
A decent to a one-bedroom apartment but $700 a month

402
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
So I mean

403
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
Copper bowl food

404
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Little donut

405
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
11:00 or something like that

406
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,976
Hell it's going to take him up on the driver

407
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,072
I feel like it's actually safer there right

408
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
I would

409
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Probably go

410
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah I'd like to travel but also I don't

411
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
Because I have my job and all

412
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Would be difficult but presuming I was

413
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
You know fancy-free and careless

414
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,016
Don't do that

415
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
Phuc yea

416
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,904
I like my job

417
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
That's weird

418
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
That's pretty weird

419
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
Yeah Walton why did he

420
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Why did he put it in lb

421
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
I think

422
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Paul Joseph Watson

423
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
So Alex is not going to

424
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Target at a Quran

425
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
You should stop offer

426
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,016
Clearly clearly he doesn't have $30,000

427
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Throw around

428
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
But

429
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
You made a very astute

430
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Observation

431
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Took his brain Force

432
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
I am

433
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
I think he definitely did

434
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
And this clip

435
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,544
I'm in my Infowars uniform today

436
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Sports

437
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
Because I need to be

438
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,296
I got my balls on the table

439
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
She'll get ready

440
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
He just called himself tuck buckford

441
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
Oh yeah he called himself these bacon character

442
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Because he really

443
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Reclaim it

444
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
That's a smart move

445
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
I think

446
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,544
Recently Alex put out a video

447
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
It was convoluted

448
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
When did receive

449
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,712
Played a character named tuck buckford

450
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Now I'm again

451
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
He had a wig on

452
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
He was a liberal guy

453
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,184
Who Alex Jones ripped off

454
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,304
Alex Jones ripped off the original tuck box for a character

455
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Personality or whatever

456
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
I meant Stephen Colbert

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Is ripping off Alex

458
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:12,288
But there's a Realtek buckford who is a super liberal and very angry

459
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
Hey it so he brings out a pinata of trump

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
And starts attacking

461
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
It's creeping

462
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:18,944
It

463
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,552
Convoluted

464
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,904
Wait so I really encourage people to watch everything he's done

465
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,488
But because it's such a mystery I do support people watch

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Okay so

467
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
Stephen Colbert

468
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
FaceTime Alex

469
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Yes

470
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Alex Jones

471
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
A liberal

472
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
Trying to murder the

473
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
Pinata

474
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Yeah

475
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,392
Yeah I see no problems with understanding that at all how could you have a

476
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
And its construction I think

477
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
I think he

478
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,032
Now I don't want to disparage his writers

479
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
But I think it's possible that not a lot of them are good at,

480
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
Possible

481
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
RAB do

482
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,016
Write me a sketch

483
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,344
Libertarian

484
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,696
Paul Joseph Watson tries to be

485
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
B status

486
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Take a note

487
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
But it's the same time

488
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,656
Him just calling himself tuck buckford on the show right there

489
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
Is a little f***** up but you're right that is kind of reclaiming like

490
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Do you think you can make fun of me I have

491
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Absorb your insult

492
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,920
Can only become stronger because of

493
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
If you hadn't made that video 100% agree about it

494
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,136
That one doesn't support that

495
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Not much

496
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Every gets back

497
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Screaming about how

498
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
The next few

499
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,448
Things that we have to get through our like straight-up ramp

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,776
Was it these on he's in Rambo today

501
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
Really going after the

502
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:27,456
Pinata or was he just kind of like a

503
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
And then he starts

504
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
Hearing Trump's face off

505
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Like in a way that

506
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,856
Hi interpreted as

507
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
He's mad at Trump

508
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
He's actually very mad at Trump for having to do the things that he's doing there is a level of like type

509
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
Something getting out yeah

510
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
It feels very cathartic

511
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,960
There's a textual analysis we could do of like

512
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,544
That's real you really mad at that pinata

513
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
It's also really dumb

514
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Either that or either

515
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,504
Has anybody considered putting them in

516
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Hollywood Feed

517
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
I think one guy

518
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
And that's about it

519
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,976
This next clip he misleads more about those special election

520
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,792
Mni's really tries to wind up as audio

521
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,056
I don't put a good face on things

522
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
That's reasonably true

523
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,200
- say something

524
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Unnecessarily

525
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Now things are kind of roses

526
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,672
Yeah I can't remember the last time where is like everybody

527
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Don't worry about a thing today we're all good he does a bit withdrawn

528
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Numbers are in Snowflake

529
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Results

530
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
We've defaults to the negative

531
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
Globalist

532
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
Benewah Vista

533
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
But

534
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Right now

535
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
Wishing for special elections

536
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,464
Will the Democrats spending more money than other elections

537
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
And they lost

538
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:26,496
People voting with

539
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Illegally

540
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
Call David confirmed on coming out the last election but still they lost

541
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
Debate questions

542
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,808
Weeks before to Hillary

543
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,024
Trump called it out but still on

544
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:59,520
Forget to the Superbowl for NBA basketball this is the real game of life

545
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
For the future of America and the world

546
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
How about hot versus slavery

547
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,712
This is such an amazing powerful

548
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,528
Transmission today he really thinks it will be

549
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Mostly just talked about Johnny Depp

550
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
But

551
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,392
Did the stuff in there that

552
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Looks like

553
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
You got to really take away is

554
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
His examples of trump being like

555
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
A man that we must

556
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Emulate

557
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Brave

558
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
Someone gave Hillary Clinton questions ahead of time

559
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Announcers were mean to him

560
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,592
That's not

561
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
That's not really that great

562
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
I'm a big fan of how

563
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Borradaile of winning that election

564
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,808
Also that

565
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Oh no that's terrible

566
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,048
Really hard very hard he was completely and utterly

567
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,168
An oblivious of what the responsibilities

568
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
Illegals voting

569
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,800
If you really number comes from

570
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Actually really fast

571
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,920
Million illegals voting

572
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
A dumb tweet

573
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:17,856
Was insane which still hasn't that guy on Twitter still hasn't to back that up

574
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
How did the number get higher

575
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
It was done by Old Dominion

576
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,792
Sound like 36

577
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
6000

578
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Respondent

579
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
2

580
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,752
39 of them responded that they were illegal immigrants

581
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Who

582
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
To have photos

583
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
So

584
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
There's a couple pieces of the

585
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
That are problematic

586
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
Interviews

587
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
Showed a bunch of people I think there were 20 in

588
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Instances

589
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
How people do in the initial

590
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
Survey said that they were citizens

591
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm going to follow up interview said that they weren't

592
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,864
Which is statistically impossible

593
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
There's no way

594
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
That the respondents

595
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
20 people would lose their citizenship

596
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,544
So it indicates a lack of

597
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Care in the people who

598
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
We're filling out the survey

599
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
It was like a hundred plus question

600
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
On the survey

601
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
People speculate

602
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
That the methodology of it was

603
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Was flawed

604
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,600
And people weren't giving correct dance

605
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
So forgiving

606
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
100 correct

607
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
Never

608
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
I've never paid attention

609
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
To 100 question

610
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
7 million is a high-end estimate 100000 to 5

611
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
7 million

612
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,520
That people have speculated

613
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
Based on this 39 respondents

614
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
30000

615
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
So they just multiply

616
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
The population at Large

617
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Statistics

618
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
They're I don't know what the

619
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,672
How they got these responding

620
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,000
But I do know that a lot of people who do surveys

621
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
End up doing them

622
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Through these services

623
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
That are available

624
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
Through Amazon

625
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
They have a system called

626
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Twerking

627
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
Where you can sign up

628
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
A user

629
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
MMA pay you like

630
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
$0.30

631
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
To do a survey

632
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Tractor like bounce your ass up

633
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Sundown

634
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
No

635
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
No that's something else that's something else that's twerking

636
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
Oceans is closed but

637
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:31,488
Universities a lot of research centers

638
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Have

639
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Conn's

640
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Responses that they need

641
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
And they pay people like a nickel or a dime to fill out surveys to psychological

642
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
And prescription work

643
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
Work on this Amazon portal

644
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
But they have

645
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
I don't know for sure

646
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
If this is what they use

647
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
But if it is

648
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
I've seen studies like it

649
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
On on these

650
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,272
Hummus perking site

651
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
And I also know

652
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,184
Because they're getting paid

653
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,208
Like $0.10

654
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
For survey so they speed through them

655
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
They just

656
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Fill out bubble

657
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
So they can try and make a living wage

658
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
On it or at least make a decent amount of money

659
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,312
Possible based on the anomalies that are found with the

660
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
People reporting

661
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
That they didn't

662
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,944
They lost their citizenship and stuff like that

663
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,808
It's entirely possible that a large section of the people responding to the survey work

664
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,208
So that's entirely possible but be that as it may even if it is all sincere respondents

665
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,024
39 people out of 30000

666
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Is not a large enough

667
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,608
Sample size to be demographic

668
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
We interesting

669
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
And many many professors

670
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Have written

671
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
About how this study is not something

672
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
To be cited

673
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
It's not it doesn't pass muster

674
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Statistical ethics

675
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
There's

676
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
How could that many

677
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
Illegal

678
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Citizens

679
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Possibly vote

680
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
2%

681
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Of the total

682
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
For what

683
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,072
It's two and a half 3% of

684
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
The total population

685
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
7 million out of

686
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
200

687
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
It's more like 200

688
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Right

689
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
So that means that you

690
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Gaunt

691
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
To the voting booth

692
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
With an illegal

693
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Many of them probably

694
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
At your polling station

695
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
You Are by like

696
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,160
Raise your hand if you're an illegal citizen

697
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Citizen

698
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,888
That's why your migration

699
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,520
Chicago is like

700
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
2 million people

701
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,616
Two and a half million people so that's like

702
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,688
25 of the entire population of Chicago

703
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Across the country vote

704
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
It seems

705
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
It seems ridiculous

706
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
It's absolutely

707
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
People

708
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,304
Like if you're using this this

709
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Debunked

710
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,376
Statistic about the last general election

711
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
Curry point

712
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
With the special elections in

713
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Vicarious

714
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Aurum in Atlanta

715
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
But be that as it may

716
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Like it doesn't

717
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
You have no statistic

718
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Nickelback this up

719
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
You're just too

720
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,088
Really work is audience

721
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Send you a fever

722
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,904
This is freedom vs. slavery

723
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,464
This is the most important Battle of all of our lives

724
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
I'm at something important

725
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
Because that sort of ethos

726
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
Fatheads

727
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
Is where he lives

728
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Right now

729
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
Today

730
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
The current date

731
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Jedi vs Sith

732
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,056
The current day of the show is not fun

733
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,080
Because

734
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,872
He's legit at War

735
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
Like anybody anybody listening

736
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Who's crazy

737
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
I think they would

738
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,880
They could really could really hurt somebody

739
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,696
It's not like he's saying anything illegal

740
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
Football

741
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
And we're going to get to some of it it's just

742
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
Hey listening to this bum me out especially after listening to 20

743
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
15

744
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
At least in 2015 he's

745
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
Not trying to get people

746
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,384
Interesting idiots

747
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
He is oh no.

748
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,248
So let's get let's go

749
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
He wants to talk about some headlines

750
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,880
WWE style promo

751
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
About the global

752
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,824
Property

753
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,456
So real quick the lady who said that Trump is like a suicide bomber

754
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
Was saying that you shouldn't cuddle up to him

755
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Because he's going

756
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
To destroy

757
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,880
Sort of a warning to.

758
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
This is a dangerous thing

759
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,768
Dante is literally, everybody is aware of

760
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816
Nobody in the GOP is paying

761
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,888
Much of these bombers

762
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
We were following them

763
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
Be that as it may

764
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
The other thing you talkin about is

765
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,128
MSNBC analyst said we should blow up Trump Tower

766
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
Again that was

767
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
That was that same one forwards like

768
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,064
If I were nominated

769
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
The first most likely can

770
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:50,208
Malcolm Nance was just on Realty

771
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
With Bill Maher

772
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
Breitbart editor was on with him

773
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,840
They were disgusting

774
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Effective fake news

775
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Stuff like that

776
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
Story that Alex

777
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
Talking about

778
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Malcolm was like

779
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
You know

780
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
Something you posted on your site

781
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Head Called Death Row

782
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
I have gotten

783
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
And my family have gotten death

784
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
Because of something that you lied about on your side

785
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
And the guy was like

786
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:23,488
Well I'm going to have to look at that I don't know how early bulshit

787
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,560
Tootsie bear look into that

788
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,400
I don't know every story that goes up on the site that sort of Dodge

789
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
Actually don't know what his position was or anything

790
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Was Bannon

791
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,336
Be there

792
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,920
Yeah but be that as it may Alex is like on that same tip

793
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
He's on the same story

794
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,344
And for all we know he might be the one who's responsible for Malcolm Nance

795
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
I mean it's not

796
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
True the story

797
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,000
Dickies telling is not true and there's real-world harm that comes from pitching those parody

798
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Play how do we know

799
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
That it's not

800
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
That's a really good point

801
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,496
Considered that Malcolm Nance

802
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Is

803
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
Sending his family.

804
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
False flag

805
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:13,920
Could be that

806
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,992
It's possible from all angles

807
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,624
If everything's works whenever you feel like your wife

808
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,464
I could die at any moment.

809
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:33,120
Monica stories

810
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,168
Is saying are not really true

811
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,496
How many the Mika Brzezinski did say that Trump has established

812
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:44,128
Take a lot of people feel that way

813
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
He mischaracterizing

814
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
The bombers sort the suicide bomber story

815
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
Mischaracterized

816
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,136
But even then is mischaracterization of the suicide

817
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
How many years like a suicide

818
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,232
Like I would say even

819
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Out of contacts if somebody was just like

820
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,632
Trump is like a suicide bomber I be like yeah he's trying to destroy the entire country

821
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:11,264
Or blackmail whatever

822
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Situation

823
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
70 f****** years old

824
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,896
Done everything it needs to do anyways

825
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,944
Play sing about Trump Jr

826
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
Professor

827
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,888
MB

828
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
Professor from Trinity University wrote a blog post called let them f****** die

829
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
The blog post if you read it is about

830
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
There are a lot of

831
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,136
But it's but it's basic

832
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:01,696
There are people

833
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
Well I got Trinity behind me now little more eloquent on the Fly it's like

834
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
How to write something down I'm sure it would be every

835
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,240
Actually would probably just be

836
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
The bug

837
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
Assets

838
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:23,712
Is about how there were a lot of people who are up

839
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,320
Can people by Race by gender

840
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:33,696
He's laying out is really an argument he wants to make

841
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,280
And that is that you will not get any brownie points from big

842
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
It's for saving their lives

843
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Call f******

844
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
No you will not you are being

845
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
If you

846
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Let's say run into a burning building

847
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
To save a bigots life

848
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,312
If you were a doctor and you save a bigots life

849
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
We live in this fantasy in our head

850
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,735
That like I was saved by a black person

851
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
You know

852
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
Hallmark movie

853
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
It doesn't

854
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
Work like that generally in the real world

855
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,743
We're coming to a crisis

856
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
This point and you if you are in a disc

857
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
Franchise class

858
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
Should never put yourself at risk

859
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
To help someone

860
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Who hates you

861
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
You there are black.

862
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
In hospitals

863
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Specifically pointed out by people

864
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
I don't want that doctor to hell

865
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
Turn higher

866
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
There

867
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
You should give out a questionnaire like do you want to Black.

868
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
Emergency rooms

869
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
With black doctors in the

870
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Just let white people

871
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,167
I'm totally fine

872
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
People

873
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
I don't know the argument that he's making tell from the from the stomach

874
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,127
The argument is laid out in that blog is not like

875
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,199
Actively go murder people

876
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Don't

877
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,039
Don't exert any effort to save people's lives

878
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
As I said

879
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Don't give a s***

880
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Again

881
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,975
You're not happy that he got shot

882
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Cineworld

883
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
Could not have been shot

884
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
Yeah I wish that were I wish I were pause

885
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Yeah

886
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
He has held architect of world

887
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
That has led to him getting shot

888
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
The world is a better place without him

889
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
Yeah

890
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
Because of mass

891
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Mental illness

892
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
Re-education camps

893
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,695
Third culture bombs

894
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
Implosion right now

895
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695
Bumpers

896
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,767
Who released the bio-weapon

897
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
Set

898
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Insanity

899
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
That's that's

900
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:30,079
He's already said that we're against the globalist

901
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
Bye-bye new Alex Jones Brandon Walker

902
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Only with

903
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
Deep Earth

904
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:44,159
Steel

905
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,999
What's the stopping power of a 9 mm

906
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,583
Never really experienced for college

907
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
So I

908
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
Discount is a penny

909
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
Quite a bit

910
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,703
This situation with this

911
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,287
Professor at Trinity

912
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
And people are pretty mad about it

913
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
And I wonder I wonder what

914
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:09,247
The situation at Evergreen happened a little bit ago

915
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Like within the last month

916
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
That's a day of absence

917
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,463
Situation I think that's a little bit more nuanced than the people are really giving up Reddit

918
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,279
I think there's arguments on both sides

919
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
The professor did not

920
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,119
I have the obligation to leave

921
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,423
But I think

922
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
He's being a f****** a****** for not

923
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
Has wavered and then changed to

924
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Come on

925
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:40,991
Yeah they also I mean sure the administration at schools acting a little bit weird

926
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
But also

927
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:46,879
I don't I don't really care I think you could have left campus

928
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,719
F****** come on you don't have the right to not

929
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
I have actions that are dickish that you do not make you a shitheel

930
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
Like you are kind of an a****** you should be treated like it

931
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
Even if you make a principled stance

932
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Again

933
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Something that is

934
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
The reality is

935
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
Come on man

936
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
The reality to is

937
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,759
That those schools that had to be closed

938
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Because of bomb threat

939
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
I am murder

940
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,135
Devastated

941
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,975
Quite literally are devastated

942
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
I will give them

943
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Call

944
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
Is a culture bomb only in the Sun

945
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,119
But when you go to it you're exposed

946
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,167
Things you would not be exposed to otherwise

947
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Challenges

948
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Your growth

949
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
Those are the things

950
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
That happened on most college camp

951
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Not liberal indoctrination

952
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
Or anything like that that's a load of horseshit

953
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
I think the best liberal inductive

954
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Of course meeting

955
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,575
People

956
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:51,903
In a homogeneous

957
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
If you meet people on a global scale

958
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
You start to have a global world

959
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Yeah absolutely

960
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
The reality of all this is

961
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
You know more nuanced

962
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Maybe slightly controversial things

963
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
People are saying

964
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,567
That

965
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,103
Strictly speaking racist

966
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,455
Or I would never call the guy the professor at Evergreen races

967
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
For his actions

968
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Like I said it's kind of an a******

969
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
A butt

970
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,927
The reaction is decidedly right

971
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,535
All the threats that have made these schools closed down

972
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Are not because

973
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,167
Liberals

974
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,567
Yeah it is liberal kids finally waking up to the

975
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,383
Patriots and so they're finally getting out of it

976
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
And the way that they express their

977
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
Threatening to murder lots of

978
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,927
What you do you know what I was going to think about you I've come to realize that on a certain level every generation

979
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
It's kind of like a new operating

980
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
System we have to reboot a little bit

981
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
It's so

982
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
Maybe it's not strictly speaking every generation

983
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
But every now and again

984
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
Fairies like a cultural

985
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Upgrade

986
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
To our system that happen

987
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,639
Racial understanding

988
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Another one was

989
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Homosexual

990
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Lifestyle understanding

991
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Another one

992
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Trans understanding

993
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,367
And it's not always as cut-and-dry as those thing

994
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
But I think that we reboot a little bit

995
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,767
And we we have to integrate our worldviews

996
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,631
Is a process that a lot of people are resistant to

997
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
Cuz they're like no I love

998
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
Nintendo

999
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
The original

1000
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
No I don't want

1001
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
Super Nintendo

1002
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,359
But there are everybody

1003
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
Super Nintendo

1004
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:52,223
Sundials are arguably very reliable

1005
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,295
There's there are people who hold on

1006
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,927
To like no I don't want to be taken away from the old operating system but I'm very comfortable

1007
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
I have to learn

1008
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,255
To be accepting it

1009
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,047
Understand

1010
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
View of humanity

1011
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
Avocation

1012
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Easily had that response

1013
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
X

1014
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Stop and

1015
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Think through it

1016
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,151
Before I special

1017
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
It's part of the system upgrade is

1018
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:30,623
Resistance to grow through that

1019
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,327
I was fine and it was the first time that somebody is like we don't say that

1020
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,191
Has like that come on and write about it

1021
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
That's a part of the upgrade

1022
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,479
It's better it doesn't hurt

1023
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,647
But some people are like 5 upgrades

1024
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Like

1025
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
The thing is

1026
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
College students

1027
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
Are kind of like

1028
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
They have a beta version of the Opera

1029
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
I don't need beta-like

1030
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
Beta Alpha I mean like it's

1031
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,495
It's not it's a little glitchy

1032
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,567
They run the program put their Hardware is

1033
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:27,199
And so often they end up being really bad and bassadors of a good thing

1034
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,527
Yeah I'm so you have these college students come out

1035
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,343
And they end up getting on TV

1036
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Let me say crazy

1037
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
Where what they mean is

1038
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
But what they're saying is

1039
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,255
Really unpolished

1040
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
And bad for television

1041
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
So

1042
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,887
People like Alex who's resistant to cultural upgrades to a

1043
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
Instagram

1044
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,727
See these college kids saying dumbass

1045
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
I defend the spirit of but not belittle letter I was right

1046
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
White people

1047
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,991
He's just making fun of the

1048
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
Like it's like someone playing an early release of the video game

1049
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Everything like

1050
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,671
Not realizing that the polished version of it isn't it

1051
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Credible game

1052
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,535
I am not entirely certain whether or not

1053
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
Amazing metaphor or a

1054
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:20,191
Tortured metaphor that you really ran through the ringer I don't know either

1055
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
Either that is a

1056
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:27,103
It's like either you hit the nail on the head with that metaphor

1057
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
Through the whole thing you got from starts

1058
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,735
Finish on it

1059
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
Situation

1060
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,647
Endless all got it

1061
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:46,047
We all got an instant we all figured it out immediately

1062
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,935
I bet I can move this run other Ted Bundy really wanted to get to was the idea of the college

1063
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
Being a glitchy version of a good

1064
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,311
It's really easy to make fun of kids

1065
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
4

1066
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
Not being adults

1067
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,199
Due to certain degree

1068
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,343
Will find out

1069
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
If I'm an idiot

1070
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
So someone who isn't

1071
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Alex

1072
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,327
Most of this episode deals with Johnny Depp

1073
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
I am

1074
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
How can

1075
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Mediocre at best joke

1076
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:30,591
Well your gums are at

1077
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,503
Drug addict meth head looks like

1078
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Trying to act cool

1079
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,487
Stevie Ray Vaughan to play the guitar

1080
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
Is a joke stumbling around

1081
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,823
Liberal

1082
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:07,711
Listen to put up with

1083
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,367
Drugged out so brainwashed

1084
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,871
A bunch of

1085
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
Moronic

1086
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:43,295
My numbed zombie looking twit fan when he says

1087
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,111
Just hold on God

1088
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:50,719
I just said something

1089
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,559
Jumped on the whole bandwagon of other

1090
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
America

1091
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
Muslim

1092
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,551
Western Civilization

1093
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,887
They want they want

1094
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:36,031
It's such a pathetic

1095
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Just adjusting

1096
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,639
Drugged out with Meth mouth

1097
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,623
Politically

1098
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:18,527
Dogcraft

1099
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:34,399

Play johnnyswim ball death

1101
00:55:55,135 --> 00:56:01,279
I think he needs help

1102

Royal Rumble.

1103
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
Start places you could go

1104
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:12,287
Doc Martens

1105
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:18,687
Just a question I'm not insinuating anything by the way this is going to be

1106
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:22,527
I like the last time

1107
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,927
Mattress fascinated with president

1108
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,791
Seriously

1109
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:46,847
Elijah living

1110
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,687
How does

1111
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
Alex

1112
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,999
Spiritually ripping off Hunter S Thompson 2

1113
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
Except I'm not

1114
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,471
So why we need another one

1115
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,287
I was trying to keep up with

1116
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
All of the insult

1117
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
I don't

1118
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
You look

1119
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,503
He might have at some point

1120
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
I'm sure he does a lot of Coke

1121
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Who does it matter

1122
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,135
Is too cheap.

1123
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Also

1124
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
I mean if you're going by that

1125
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
Speed of speech

1126
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:42,143
Definitely not doing meth

1127
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Caden

1128
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,727
City Futsal

1129
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Dr. Gonzo Style

1130
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
Yeah it's

1131
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,943
If it's a version of cool to have

1132
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,759
Just wanted to say you're putting on an SX station

1133
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,295
You are not

1134
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,831
You're not this cool

1135
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
But you can

1136
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,719
You can't get the child molester after

1137
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,071
That's kind of an object

1138
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:16,191
Do you like you look like a child molester Stevie Ray Vaughan to pull that off in Haiti

1139
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,983
I don't know

1140
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:27,967
He would not feel sorry for her not hateful political you do not

1141
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,807
A little bit

1142
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
Goodwill

1143
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
Be the first to be like I love

1144
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
I love Johnny Depp in

1145
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
Elm Street

1146
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:46,399
Breakout rue21

1147
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
Let's face it

1148
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,703
The first Pirates movie

1149
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
Wasn't that bad

1150
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
He did a great job

1151
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
Epic I loved it bright

1152
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,407
Sure he said some things that I don't agree with but

1153
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
He's dead

1154
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
We got a receipt

1155
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,271
Fine the other thing

1156
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
That I'm most

1157
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
Defended by in there is Alex

1158
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
He uses Dutch safe

1159
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Speech but he's threatening

1160
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Johnny Depp's wife

1161
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
There's nobody else to hear that

1162
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,119
Other than

1163
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,775
I want someone to kill Johnny killed for running his mouth

1164
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,311
He's implying that he hopes

1165
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,383
Sooner also the

1166
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,711
Someone can find out where you are and pump a bunch of bullets in you

1167
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
I don't want that

1168
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Yeah

1169
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
Alex

1170
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
Is irresponsible cuz

1171
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
He does not

1172
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Recognize how crazy

1173
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
His fans are

1174
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Like

1175
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
He knows

1176
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,583
He doesn't apply the requisite caution

1177
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
If we had

1178
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
Caution

1179
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Have the fan

1180
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,239
Right but that's irresponsible to humanity

1181
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
Will ya

1182
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:00,127
Okay well

1183
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,967
Alex Jones is bad for human

1184
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,527
And this next one

1185
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,551
I wish

1186
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
I wish

1187
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
If there's

1188
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
One thing that I

1189
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Think should be restricted

1190
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
In his free speech

1191
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
Is he's not allowed to say the word

1192
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,095
No situation

1193
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,119
He has said multi

1194
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,823
They they screw up and they take advantage of America's open this

1195
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359

1196
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,919

1198
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,855
We're talkin about something and the thing that he's attacking

1199
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:46,719
Is the cousin the only way you should be able to say the word kind

1200
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
The first said

1201
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,791
But people who are kind

1202
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,375
We must abolish.

1203
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,679

Except as a relates to God

1207
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
And

1208
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
And of course

1209
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,087
He wants true diversity

1210
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,111
Just means what

1211
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,743
If you if you want to put the word truevine diversity that

1212
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,815
Do you know what you could say I want Diversey

1213
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,863
Which means I want all kinds

1214
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
The people here

01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423

01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,351
Wild anti-semitic conspiracy theorist David Duke

Raps

1229
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
Violent rhetoric a little more

1230
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:09,919
Look at

1231
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,015
Kill his family

1232
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,623
The Property Brothers

1233

Add

1234
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,631
14 killing people

1235
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,647
You live in the lap of luxury acted tough and cool all day

1236
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
I want to say like I don't know what like

1237
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:00,351
I don't know what calling for someone's recovery is going to do I don't know how much it's going to help this isn't like a

1238
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Tinkerbell situation

1239
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,191
Although I don't know how how negative

1240
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Calls for someone's recovery is

1241
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:11,103
Also I mean if you're booing somebody's calls for

1242
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,407
Recovery it's like

1243
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:17,247
Well neither of us

1244
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,575
Call Jill

1245
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,623
You know what you know what I

1246
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,415
Here's the thing

1247
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,439
Just now

1248
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
Realize that

1249
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,767
That phrase

1250
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
Running your mouth

1251
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
Always

1252
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Suggest violence

1253
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,911
Solutions

1254
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
He's running

1255
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
Like that's what

1256
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,335
He's running his mouth kind of suggest

1257
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,871
So punch him

1258
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
Close his mouth

1259
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,991
That you know if your if you say something like always

1260
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:53,343
Talking out of school

1261
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
Good-natured ribbing

1262
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
Running your mouth

1263
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
Is always

1264
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,279
I don't know but at the same time running your mouth

1265
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
Connotation

1266
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
I feel like it's I think it's

1267
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
I think it's in the realm of

1268
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,959
This might just be you

1269
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
It could just be

1270
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,055
And it's because I

1271
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
Starting to run your mouth

1272
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,455
No idea

1273
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
No idea

1274
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
I go for David Brock in older people

1275
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,927
About operation

1276
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,255
We're aware of all the different

1277
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,167
Scientists engineers the surgeons

1278
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,983
And their sutures

1279
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:47,103
And their instruments

1280
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,639
Cast to get cut out

1281
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:55,039
Enter the patient

1282
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:00,415
Surgery

1283
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
Pleasure

1284
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,095
I think it's clearly fused into one

1285
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:15,007
That's a lot of wars Civil War start is you never really have a demarcation line whenever shot heard around the world

1286
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:21,407
7075 twin

1287
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,295
The world

1288
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
And

1289
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,159
You can hardly walk

1290
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:37,791
I saw a clip of a wall

1291
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:53,407
How all of this works

1292
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
And so

1293
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:00,831
You're not calling you Civil War you're saying you wanted Insurrection Trump supporters

1294
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,863
Publications by Obama's

1295
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
We're going back to the rant in a second

1296
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
Understand that one

1297
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,287
New elections run by Obama

1298
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
This is one of the

1299
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,919
Fears that Alex Jones has that

1300
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,247
Obama's National Security

1301
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,319
It's only based on the fact that

1302
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,391
Obama Russian meddling in

1303
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,535
In the election in the lead up to it

1304
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
Smeg

1305
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Our election

1306
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
A piece

1307
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,911
Of federal

1308
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Protected it's

1309
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,495
Right

1310
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
To push through

1311
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
And Alex Jones

1312
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
Interpreted that as

1313
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Bedroom lamp

1314
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,271
Yeah I would say automatic voter

1315
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,063
History and federal election

1316
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
It's probably the best

1317
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
Get rid of the Electoral

1318
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Pro-collagen

1319
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:15,583
That's probably not a terrible idea

1320
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
Alright alright

1321
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:25,055
Guns

1322
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,015
You take us from

1323
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,087
Powerful to incredibly powerful

1324
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,159
Listen to Martyrs you take us to the next level

1325
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,487
Episode 4 Star Wars

1326
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,815
We become more powerful

1327
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,143
History

1328
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,479
As long as we're focused as long as we have courage and as long as we don't you're going to lose

1329
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
Korea

1330
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,087
We have set up a dictatorship

1331
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,951
Images of China

1332
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
Under vassal control

1333
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:23,423
Orthodox Christian

1334
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,311
Get that music

1335
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,343
Antichrist

1336
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,975
That's a real f*****-up way. Wait wait

1337
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
Alright well

1338
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
1

1339
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,351
I can't even deal with Hollywood everything

1340
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Is movie reference

1341
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:59,519
Everything everything is movie or music video in this page

1342
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,543
Reference 22

1343
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,591
You know predictive programming

1344
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
Really surprised

1345
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,199
To me about the Run

1346
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Spreading

1347
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Like I

1348
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
Occasionally talked about how

1349
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
You know friends

1350
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
Talk about how that

1351
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
But

1352
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
I don't understand why

1353
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,679
He's saying that it's happening worldwide now other than if

1354
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
Sing about he's talking about like brexit

1355
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,919
Kelley's bringing up Korea is bringing up African-American or little

1356
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
No goodnight in that

1357
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,735
Since he's talking about how you

1358
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:46,623
You can't take away freedom in America because we have your trying to oppress up as opposed to

1359
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
Never had it

1360
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
Much easier

1361
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
To keep them in the

1362
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Depressive state

1363
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
In North Korea

1364
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
He was not

1365
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
What the

1366
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,375
Is going worldwide is

1367
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
References

1368
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:58,911
Is 2

1369
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
Lappin brexit

1370
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,263
You wouldn't say Russia but he does

1371
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,103
They call that kicked out the oligarchs they're just trying to take out the global

1372
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,759
Yeah that's why everyone hates Global influence

1373
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Imagine and inter

1374
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
Another world

1375
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
That

1376
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Believe

1377
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
Russia

1378
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
X Out etiology

1379
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,767
Maybe they kicked out the old

1380
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,559
And replace them with the new ones

1381
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,423
That's Russia Alex's version of the New Renaissance

1382
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
So these countries

1383
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,007
Cdm's out as having kicked out

1384
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
Or kicked out the globalist

1385
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,591
Does it work

1386
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,663
Fought back again

1387
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Like why would

1388
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
But then we have to

1389
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
Really get into Howie's

1390
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Globalist

1391
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
Works we can't do that

1392
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Because

1393
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
How can you

1394
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
Be like

1395
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,951
Look at these other countries they're doing things

1396
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
Write any of the same time say

1397
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:01,375
We don't need to worry about any other countries it's all about America

1398
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
So if you're spreading

1399
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
If you're spreading this like

1400
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,263
Renaissance narrative going worldwide

1401
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,567
Talking about is just the growing Mash

1402
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
Analyst

1403
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
Which is

1404
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:17,503
B I don't understand why you think that's a good idea

1405
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,575
It's like every country to be

1406
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,135
Like their own version of America

1407
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
The first

1408
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,231
Country to be partially nationalistic in

1409
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,279
Xenophobic and close their borders

1410
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,119
Not realizing that the end result of that is

1411
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Everyone

1412
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,031
Yeah it it will turn things back to like city-state

1413
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
What parts of countries will secede

1414
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,383
You will just have

1415
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Sweet destruction

1416
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,247
Any kind of international cooperation which is

1417
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,039
I mean I would be a positive goal

1418
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
But

1419
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,879
He conveniently leaves off the part where everyone

1420
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,439
Interest will butt into each other in ways

1421
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
That we do not

1422
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Have

1423
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
At that point

1424
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:05,119
Anyway to negotiate International bodies like the UN

1425
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
Or the EU

1426
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,447
They can negotiate and resolve issue

1427
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,751
Issue before they turn into

1428
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,799
You know all our war

1429
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,151
Remember how Europe was always at War for forever

1430
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,783
Is the inevitable result of his everyone should be harshly Nash

1431
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Holistic

1432
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,135
Think he's right when he says Civil War

1433
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
End result of that

1434
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,815
At least what is the United States most Libertarian

1435
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Is kind of stupid

1436
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,119
In terms of like

1437
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,423
The outcome that you want isn't

1438
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
The outcome that's going

1439
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
To come

1440
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
You know what

1441
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,031
It just indicates of like a deregulation

1442
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,359
That the conservatives and Libertarians want so

1443
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
They think it is

1444
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,967
Like a boost to the economy

1445
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:55,551
But all you're going to end up doing is empowering people who already have

1446
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,647
All of the businesses will be able to run roughshod over our enter

1447
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,207
And we'll never get to this happy face

1448
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
Eland

1449
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:06,047
It's on the other end any historical

1450
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Where in

1451
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
Regulation

1452
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Was Adam

1453
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:15,775
It was

1454
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
The 20s

1455
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,383
Not a lot of Regulation back then

1456
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,455
You know what I want to bring back those Coal Mine children

1457
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:30,367
And you know what kellyanne Conway said about

1458
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:36,767
Healthcare Bill 30 million kids are going to get kicked off Medicaid what are we going to do with them put them

1459
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:44,191
Schools are Jeffrey education can wear

1460
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,215
Work camps

1461
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,543
That's not a terrible things moving

1462
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,943
And then we take all these old people who are just f****** sucking off the government at nursing home

1463
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,271
Why don't you work at the nursing home

1464
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,159
Terrible idea

1465
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:08,767
Alex I believe is that

1466
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,095
I don't know it what I don't know what causes

1467
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,911
I don't know what to underline

1468
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,679
I don't

1469
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,263
I think you thought through the reality of the things that he's exposing

1470
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,311
Like the idea of

1471
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Free-market sounds

1472
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
Good cuz it's free

1473
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:32,063
You take to get there in the steps that he seems to encourage are all things that will have disastrous consequences

1474
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
The problem

1475
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:34,879
Withstand

1476
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,903
Fremont

1477
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
Does the same thing

1478
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Free market

1479
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Is that

1480
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
You don't realize

1481
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
How much

1482
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
How much work goes into

1483
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
Keeping it

1484
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,679
Natural state

1485
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
No

1486
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
The natural

1487
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,335
It's abusive

1488
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,455
It's very powerful people crushing people who have no power

1489
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,479
Kind of a thing that you

1490
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
You get into with with

1491
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
Just understanding language

1492
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,599
Is that to me the idea of a

1493
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Free market is everyone

1494
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,159
Having

1495
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,719
An opportunity to kind of compete

1496
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,023
Yeah you know like I think that's a good idea

1497
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,303
Equal access

1498
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Free market more than that new trial

1499
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,287
Everyone is capable of

1500
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
Equal rate at an equal level

1501
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,919
Whatever you deregulate

1502
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
And

1503
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:33,247
You can charge for Fast Lane

1504
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
You do not have a free market

1505
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
You have a closed-off guy

1506
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,903
Are already

1507
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
Participated

1508
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,231
Can do so at this level and it makes

1509
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
Damn near impossible

1510
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,095
Lower-tier

1511
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,423
And those are

1512
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
Concrete

1513
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,519
Short-term examples

1514
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
The

1515
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
Hellscape

1516
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,151
That exists on the way to a hypothetical Nirvana

1517
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Alex

1518
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
In the same way

1519
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,807
That every country even know if there is

1520
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,855
Like a fantasy land at the end of

1521
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,159
But in the interim it's just War

1522
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
I think there is

1523
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Feudalism

1524
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:23,423
Humans being eradicated from the earth entirely and it's allowed to grow which is what Alex

1525
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,007
Forms are allowed to evolve

1526
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,567
I'm starting to be for it

1527
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
Well your globalist

1528
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
Anyway

1529
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,199
So I prefer the globe

1530
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,479
2 what's on it

1531
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,247
I like Globes

1532
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:42,367
Civil War

1533
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,695
But there's no shot that was heard around the world there's no demarcation line

1534
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Different

1535
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
Demarcation line

1536
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,679
Powerful

1537
01:16:55,935 --> 01:17:01,823
Pizza deals with other trying to start a Civil War and now we're already

1538
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:08,735
With Congressman scalise get shot

1539
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,559
Congress

1540
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,375
Women

1541
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:34,591
Republicans

1542
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:40,735
3 years ago 2 years ago

1543
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:47,135
But now it's official.

1544
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:53,535
Demilitarized

1545
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
Play

1546
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,215
We can just hold

1547
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:09,407
Respond

1548
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,927
Sublease was shot June 14th

1549
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,743
I'd say that's a shot heard round the world

1550
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:30,143
You can argue already in Civil War before that and they're calling for violence and killing the president is family in every major publication

1551
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:35,775
Overthrowing the government

1552
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,591
Action Agency

1553
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,455
June 14th

1554
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,271
That's when the Civil War started

1555
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,599
So In that clip Alex's literally say

1556
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,439
Hot Civil War has started

1557
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,975
Was Augustus

1558
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
And then he's further saying

1559
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,071
We could wait

1560
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
And let them shoot us

1561
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
He doesn't say or

1562
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,191
He's very clearly

1563
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,727
Define why it is

1564
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
We don't want assault weapon

1565
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:11,359
I think I think it's a great one

1566
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,431
They used to say fire until you see the whites of their eyes

1567
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,271
Suggesting you should know who it is that you are attacking

1568
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Stead

1569
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:25,439
We're just going to hold down the trigger inmobi pulled out and I'm sorry for those of you who get killed

1570
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,095
He in that was saying

1571
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
We could

1572
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Patriots

1573
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
His side

1574
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
We could wait

1575
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
Until they kill us

1576
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,823
And I'm sorry about those of you who will end up getting killed

1577
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,871
What would he conveniently dozen

1578
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,199
Do is give the other side of that disjunct

1579
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
The other side of that

1580
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
He doesn't get to that

1581
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
Any other side of that

1582
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:56,159
Implicitly

1583
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,463
Yep and if you were someone

1584
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Prone

1585
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
Coming to Hammond

1586
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
Like a white man

1587
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,399
You have no other way to hear that then that implied other side

1588
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:14,592
We can wait until they come and kill us and I'm sorry about those of you were going to die that's a really negative

1589
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,640
The implied other side

1590
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,944
Maybe

1591
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,272
I mean this is really f******

1592
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,624
So close to

1593
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,672
Openly advocating people start

1594
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
It's close enough to warrant

1595
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
Like at the very least invested

1596
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
I would say it's

1597
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,608
Close enough for jazz

1598
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
Is there a b a

1599
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,496
I don't think Alex would like that expression I think he would think you were run

1600
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
Open your mouth I'm probably

1601
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,824
Run your mouth feel your hand

1602
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:55,040
Better than him I don't know

1603
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:03,232
And then just the entire what

1604
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
Run your mouth feel your hands

1605
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,560
On the front

1606
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,376
The transcription of the Jihad about Adam Schiff

1607
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
African grey

1608
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:18,336
Alex

1609
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,736
Reading

1610
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:32,416
That's how you learn

1611
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Alex

1612
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
Explains that a

1613
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,608
His understanding

1614
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,680
Does not understand

1615
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:57,760
Twilight zone is authoritarianism altered so many of worship throughout history always

1616
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,024
Liberalism

1617
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
What is a weapon system

1618
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,936
Johnny Depp from Kentucky

1619
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,520
Posing

1620
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:23,872
Frozen

1621
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,664
Hoping he dies

1622
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:30,272
Benedict Cumberbatch and if somebody kills you

1623
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,856
Which I hope doesn't happen one of these other Hollywood

1624
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Turds

1625
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:57,920
Wolf Blitzer is the most useless man in the history of the world

1626
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:03,040
Johnny Depp

1627
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,392
Ultraviolet

1628
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,440
I don't know

1629
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:15,072
A violet what if I kill Nicole Brown

1630
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:21,472
Why do I hope nobody kills her

1631
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,496
Sweater

1632
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:28,640
The other thing is you talk about Wolf Blitzer interviewing the guy who knew the guy who shot Steve

1633
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:34,016
The guy said that he was just fed up with politics news a good guy

1634
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
He mad about that all he wants but

1635
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,440
That's really basically what happens with any interview with someone who knew a serial killer

1636
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,768
If you watch any documentary about serial killers generally they're like

1637
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,328
I never would have predicted this from him

1638
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Quiet guy

1639
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
Self

1640
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
He was always

1641
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
Talk

1642
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,288
How's the weather

1643
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
Good

1644
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,360
Be the end of our interaction

1645
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,408
Serial killer

1646
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:05,504
Alex wants to like complain about like their friends better

1647
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
But if you want

1648
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,648
You know you're lying

1649
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,328
I don't think he's broadcasting propaganda by interviewing the guy but his

1650
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,656
Potentially limited perspective on the shooter

1651
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,448
That's nonsense

1652
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,008
Weird weird

1653
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Just heard wolves

1654
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:35,200
Now you knew it was a murderer didn't you tell me

1655
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:49,024
Someone get a funding so the other thing

1656
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,144
Two though is you talkin about like you know if someone goes ahead and murders Johnny Depp

1657
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,936
Or these other Hollywood people

1658
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
Deterred

1659
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,240
Hollywood or wolf

1660
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,568
He's throwing Wolf Blitzer even and with that like

1661
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
People who should be murdered

1662
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,176
Yeah it's very dangerous

1663
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,736
The type of stuff you saying is incredibly

1664
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,272
Aubrey's not.

1665
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,928
The Washington Post the New York Times

1666
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
There

1667
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,840
So uncoordinated

1668
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:34,336
No shoot two cops almost killed him and almost killed a congressman almost kill another person

1669
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Johnny Depp

1670
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,712
What a drugged-out

1671
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Debatable

1672
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,928
From that club one more time

1673
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:55,328
Somebody that wants to run his mouth and just because

1674
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:05,056
You're going to be held responsible

1675
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:09,152
And your publicist

1676
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,064
Organized crime

1677
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,648
Projection

1678
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,696
How will you be held accountable

1679
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,488
Well that's projection of guilt

1680
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,328
He's using your massive platform to call for violence

1681
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:31,680
You will be held responsible

1682
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,472
I'm probably going to go down

1683
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
For some of this

1684
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
Like

1685
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
We've seen it in the past

1686
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
We've seen

1687
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,432
Repeated instances of his listeners doing the things he says he'd they should do

1688
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,272
The guy who broke into Bohemian Grove heavily-armed to kill people

1689
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
Alex Jones

1690
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,648
That lady last month or two months ago

1691
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
Sending death threats

1692
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952
Do the Sandy Hook parents

1693
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,256
Was motivated by Alex Jones

1694
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Literally

1695
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Reset it

1696
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,608
The guy who showed up at Comet Ping Pong with a gun

1697
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Motivated by Alex Jones

1698
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
That's not a hundred percent his

1699
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Fault

1700
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:11,360
And besides that I don't think he necessarily should be arrested for those things but the fact that he's so flippant

1701
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
And disregard

1702
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,456
The effect that he has on mentally ill people

1703
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
Means like

1704
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,440
Scenario where that guy who had the gun

1705
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,744
Easily could have accidentally

1706
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,304
Showed up there to kill people

1707
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
Accidentally killed

1708
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,632
In that case

1709
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
How does the conversation go differ

1710
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:39,520
Is something that happened with that lady and the Sandy Hook families

1711
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,568
If she gets shown up at one of their houses

1712
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,616
Like that how is the story

1713
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,968
It's only different based on how far you crazy person took

1714
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
They took it way too far just not

1715
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,344
To the extent where now there's death

1716
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
Steve

1717
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,416
I would say if

1718
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,208
If we start going around

1719
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
Recent hate crimes

1720
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,560
I'm just started asking around like

1721
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
Listen to Alex Jones

1722
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
Bro

1723
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,448
I wouldn't be surprised if

1724
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:13,824
I don't know I don't know how solid the reporting on this but from what I've been able to find

1725
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
Timberland

1726
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,664
Tsarnaev one of the Boston bombers was a big in

1727
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,688
Infowars

1728
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,016
I know Alex is arguing

1729
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
That he would make

1730
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
Any of the

1731
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,392
Is all this is how the media portrays me as

1732
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
Crazy person

1733
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,208
These false

1734
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,280
And then they associate their Patsy with Infowars

1735
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,328
In order to turn the public against me

1736
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,120
Free meditatively

1737
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Okay great

1738
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Good

1739
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
Catalog

1740
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,032
You inspire crazy people to do Very Bad Things

1741
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
That's a good argument

1742
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,128
Yeah because you pay all of your enemies

1743
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:52,480
As pedophile you paint them as murderers who want to kill everybody

1744
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:58,368
Use a book you don't understand affordable

1745
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
So f******

1746
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Sane

1747
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,440
Every

1748
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Everybody is

1749
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,744
Is the most evil

1750
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
It's amazing

1751
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
To me that you can't

1752
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
Just criticized

1753
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,376
Johnny Depp without bringing it in

1754
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
He's a child below

1755
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,056
You don't like what he said

1756
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
You don't think he's a very good actor

1757
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,480
We can debate that right I saw the revamped Willy Wonka

1758
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,528
Yeah

1759
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,832
Like you don't need to call him a child

1760
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,392
Well and if someone were to like just

1761
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,672
Strictly attack Alex

1762
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,976
This physique or whatever

1763
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,280
Why you got to send

1764
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,816
F****** b*******

1765
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,352
He would whine

1766
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,400
So hard if somebody

1767
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,680
If somebody was like

1768
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,264
Look at this m************ brainforest mouth motherfuker

1769
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,736
Has more to do with Johnny Depp

1770
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,320
The news says Howard Jones

1771
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,648
Kiki made a guy that has luster

1772
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
Alex

1773
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,888
He's talking about the song

1774
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:17,984
That argument is

1775
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
2Wire

1776
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
Not his fault or why he has

1777
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
Is no real

1778
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:25,920
The gate

1779
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:31,040
Recommend ever want to go find that clip that people should go check it out

1780
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,832
Posted

1781
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
Erroneous false

1782
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,648
Information on his website

1783
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,720
About the car

1784
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:44,096
And he's just absolutely lying but even then if you just say go check it out

1785
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,376
Us

1786
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,912
Establish that it is a

1787
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
Den of

1788
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,472
Pedophiles

1789
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,008
Traffickers

1790
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
Murderers the worst

1791
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:53,568
Human being

1792
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,640
Available so if you're saying go check it out

1793
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,176
What's implied there is

1794
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
If you check it out on arm

1795
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:03,552
You might get your probably going to die video

1796
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,576
The Soviet poster

1797
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,856
Of himself going

1798
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,136
To Comet Ping Pong

1799
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,928
Now you probably kind of drunk

1800
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,464
Or hi and that video

1801
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,304
Then his friend were even talking about being kind of scared

1802
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,888
Going to a family Eatery

1803
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:23,520
It's not that we are totally right. The implied thing there is you might die

1804
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,544
So be careful

1805
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,896
Alaskan hard-hitting Quest

1806
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,712
Seems like it would be a better use

1807
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,088
I've seen videos of people who went with cameras

1808
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,648
James alefantis

1809
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Himself

1810
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,440
Went outside

1811
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
And talk to them

1812
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,744
Answer questions

1813
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,816
He took one of them inside and showed him all around

1814
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,120
Music

1815
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:51,424
Just took him around like

1816
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,984
Nonsense

1817
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,288
You guys need to be out there protesting

1818
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
You want a coffee

1819
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:01,152
Super nice to them

1820
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:04,224
I don't normally do this you guys want

1821
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
Selma by the slice here but listen

1822
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,552
You guys seem nice

1823
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,344
Night Kitchen

1824
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,720
It's all nonsense

1825
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
That would be the best

1826
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,536
Like just

1827
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,560
Okay go ahead

1828
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:25,984
It's all true

1829
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,520
You guys want some coffee

1830
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:41,856
Witnesses that were there

1831
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:48,512
Trump supporters

1832
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
Who was an actor

1833
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,216
On a already felony plea deal

1834
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,496
In another state

1835
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:03,360
Comes in

1836
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:10,016
How does a month after I said drop the story it's a decoy before the Press ever targeted me

1837
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:15,648
So no one ever said he was necessarily the author of A330 pushed it

1838
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,440
He was guilty

1839
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:19,232
Of the guy show

1840
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,792
Talked about how he was influenced by Alex

1841
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:26,912
Rat in Spanish

1842
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
Who had other conviction

1843
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:35,104
And the cops came to go do that

1844
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,712
Required for that to be true are insane

1845
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,504
The moving parts required for

1846
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,320
The real version of a story that a crazy person game

1847
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,624
Look around with a gun

1848
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Because you listen to Alex

1849
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,672
Be very

1850
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,792
On the air about the atomic bomb

1851
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,584
Crazy guy

1852
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
Just to be sure

1853
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Just to be

1854
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Be clear

1855
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,704
We're

1856
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,728
We talked about it

1857
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,496
Mastiff

1858
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,520
Conspiracy theorist

1859
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
Triumph

1860
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,592
The phrase Occam's razor

1861
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,896
Out of it

1862
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:14,528
Point Break with Occam's razor

1863
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,344
That doesn't make sense there's people

1864
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,648
Too much s*** going on how about it's just one dude

1865
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,440
Yeah

1866
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,000
I am really frustrated by

1867
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
Characterization

1868
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,840
Because it's always

1869
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,376
100% support the

1870
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:32,448
The police

1871
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
That is

1872
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,752
DC police

1873
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,544
Making everything up

1874
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,312
Sweeterman

1875
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,872
And then you've got the

1876
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
Police

1877
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,504
Consumption

1878
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
And there's always

1879
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,880
You need to know that there are good cops

1880
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,904
And bad cops

1881
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:55,488
But you don't know who they are and the good cop

1882
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,768
Splendidly

1883
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
Black people

1884
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,328
Yeah

1885
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,352
It's it

1886
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
Very much

1887
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
Something where

1888
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,704
You with you would think

1889
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,264
Try to have some kind of through-line

1890
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,056
Some kind of Baseline

1891
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
For how you should treat

1892
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,688
No jumping in the DC police

1893
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,712
With the peace

1894
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
Gay people

1895
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,296
He doesn't have like a through-line of

1896
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,624
What makes one good what makes one bad

1897
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,648
Ketchup ketchup

1898
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,464
Whatever the circumstances are

1899
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
Through-line whatever

1900
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,560
You does it serve my narrative

1901
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,584
Exactly

1902
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:57,184
We're not the ones running around saying kill everybody we're not the one saying bomb Trump Tower

1903
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:09,472
Kill kill kill kill this person kill that person what's Johnny Depp

1904
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,064
They're going to turn it into a horrible lightning

1905
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,256
Supporters

1906
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
You're wearing Trump hat

1907
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:42,752
It's political

1908
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,288
Clip but

1909
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,360
Did you just

1910
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,504
Before we introduce the next cut

1911
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,784
Life clip

1912
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,600
The previous flight

1913
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,392
What are they going to do

1914
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,184
So

1915
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,768
The thing there is we get a real glimpse into Alex Jones thinks the world Opera

1916
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
Deal with first

1917
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
Johnny Depp

1918
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,472
Cuz he's someone who's not an act

1919
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,240
Who doesn't

1920
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Just talk

1921
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,824
These are positive

1922
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,384
Right but those are positive attributes

1923
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
And these heard of world of

1924
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,712
Macho Alex Jones

1925
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,320
Implicitly what are you saying

1926
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,112
Some real man comes on

1927
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,136
You got a kill you

1928
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,464
That's not good that's very irresponsible again

1929
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,232
People are going

1930
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,512
To hear that coded language

1931
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,352
He seems to think

1932
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,656
The globalist

1933
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,936
Water Civil War

1934
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:48,544
I'm so they're putting out these messages but no one else is really picking up Onix

1935
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
Except for him

1936
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
And that is the jump off

1937
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,128
Let's jump off

1938
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Let's do this

1939
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,712
Let's provoke the Patriots into attack

1940
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:59,296
You're not the only person

1941
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,088
I really think that is

1942
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
Experiencing those things

1943
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,160
Probably because of

1944
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,720
Very it's very dangerous

1945
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
I'm having trouble with his

1946
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
Is language

1947
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Because

1948
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
II

1949
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:12,864
And I

1950
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,888
Feel like it

1951
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912
Part of doing

1952
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
Is podcast

1953
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
It's hard knock

1954
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Talk in the

1955
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,616
Okay

1956
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,152
To do it there in like

1957
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,968
Minions kill Trump and all of these things

1958
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,992
Daenerys every

1959
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
Thing is Viola

1960
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,040
Every metaphors

1961
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
Violin every

1962
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,624
Everything that he's talking about is always

1963
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,672
The threat of violence for the

1964
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
Reply

1965
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
Totally

1966
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
All I can think of when he says like

1967
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,608
They're starting a Civil War and all the s*** is that

1968
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
Kind of

1969
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,936
Blizzard reaction

1970
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:53,824
Girl we are starting that's not good

1971
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,200
It's getting into my f******

1972
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,504
Consider that

1973
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,112
Unintentional

1974
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,416
But I don't think you will

1975
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:18,144
My reaction doing all this like they're trying to start a civil war they're promoting violence

1976
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
And all I hear is

1977
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,448
You are trying

1978
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,240
Not you Alex

1979
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Projection

1980
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,080
I get I get

1981
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,128
Cuz I look into the stories

1982
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,432
Video sites I look into sources

1983
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,504
And all of them don't accurately depict his rep

1984
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,272
Presentation

1985
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,552
So I know that either

1986
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:38,112
He's unaware of the nuanced reality

1987
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,136
Stop

1988
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,416
He's intentionally twisting it

1989
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Service

1990
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
And either way what you doing is

1991
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
Speeding in

1992
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:47,840
Separation

1993
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
He's feeding into radicalization

1994
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,960
Vulcanization the thing he's super afraid of

1995
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,264
He's making his followers

1996
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,056
So much further from the rest

1997
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
The general population

1998
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,408
Results of that much like

1999
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,944
Extreme nationalism

2000
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,968
Is just War

2001
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,016
It's just going to be

2002
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,088
Just rhetoric can't get ramp down

2003
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,624
This sort of thing isn't

2004
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,184
Something he can be escalate on his own real

2005
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,232
There has to be something

2006
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
What is a payoff

2007
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:20,608
All of the economic collapse

2008
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,168
Talk the payoff the blow off of the

2009
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,960
The feud

2010
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,240
Is

2011
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
Person telling people go

2012
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,056
That's to prep you for that

2013
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,592
Now hopefully

2014
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
All of the

2015
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,640
This rhetoric is

2016
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,664
Just leaving to a selfie

2017
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:39,296
Hopefully down the line cuz the only other logical blow-off is

2018
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Actual

2019
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,392
News hoping that something happens if you just waiting

2020
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,976
And then he can

2021
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
Spin his

2022
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,608
Well if it's a minority I can say that they're attacking

2023
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,960
He's just waiting

2024
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,728
For something to happen

2025
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,008
Validate his rattle

2026
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Yeah

2027
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
Really f******

2028
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,848
Bummer

2029
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,128
He's talking to a

2030
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,920
In the same way that he

2031
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Deescalate

2032
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
DF

2033
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
If he

2034
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,320
Escalated even the Slate

2035
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,624
He's out now

2036
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,464
He's reached essentially his feeling

2037
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
Obliquely

2038
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,192
Threatening people like specifically

2039
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
And not

2040
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,264
Not far away

2041
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
That do threading

2042
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,104
The kill me

2043
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,944
We're in a hospital started on June 14th

2044
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,736
They're coming

2045
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,808
Some of us are going to die if we don't get offenses

2046
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,368
All of this stuff taken as a whole is

2047
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,136
Bike

2048
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:49,184
We not we know what you're saying

2049
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,208
Yeah

2050
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:50,976
Bad

2051
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,840
So

2052
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,888
Pei

2053
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
Is really

2054
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,008
Yeah

2055
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,032
Find this

2056
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,104
I almost don't want to play the rest

2057
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,176
There's not really anything else

2058
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:14,784
Other than theme but he complains about Joe Scarborough a little bit

2059
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:19,392
Take me a job

2060
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,672
All right I don't like

2061
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,144
Forgotten

2062
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,504
Mars Attacks aliens

2063
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,904
Alien from Mars

2064
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,304
Martian head

2065
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,864
Famous Mass murderers daughter

2066
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:12,384
Dictatorship

2067
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:20,320
Removing so you with all your billions of dollars.

2068
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:32,864
Marble policeman

2069
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:47,968
Call Church

2070
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,272
All right so just to take a quick break there

2071
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:54,368
I like the Scarborough

2072
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,304
Ghetto lol

2073
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
When he was a senator

2074
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:10,752
Who's the representative

2075
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
He was in con

2076
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,848
I don't remember

2077
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,128
Cuz I don't like Joe Scarborough

2078
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:22,528
He's probably butt on July 20th 2000 11 Scarborough's a died after hitting her head on it

2079
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,088
Scarborough

2080
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,368
Florida author

2081
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,720
According to Scarborough allegation

2082
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,768
Spread all over the Internet that you've been involved

2083
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,816
There was an investigation no evidence

2084
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
Foul Play

2085
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
And what date

2086
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,704
2001 is ripe for 911

2087
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,032
Situation

2088
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
Before 911

2089
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,848
Yeah I think that obvious

2090
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:47,872
Scarborough hell

2091
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,712
Pepper Potts

2092
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,016
Okay

2093
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
What is

2094
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,576
Evil face

2095
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,392
Stole those

2096
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
But Scarborough found

2097
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
El kabong

2098
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
Boom

2099
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,328
Done it up the desk

2100
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,168
There's no evidence of Foul Play like I said although

2101
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,472
DC cops

2102
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:19,104
Logical point

2103
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,736
The life of that rumor on the Internet is far greater than

2104
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
And the fact

2105
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,272
Merit

2106
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,576
What is the same thing with I mean

2107
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,136
Gary Condit probably did Kill Chandra Levy

2108
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
Right now we didn't

2109
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,512
Someone confess

2110
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
I don't remember

2111
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:45,472
Didn't write for 9/11

2112
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
Eminem

2113
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
911

2114
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
We're done with that

2115
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,056
Yeah I mean the only good thing

2116
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,336
To come out of 9/11 with

2117
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,616
The blueprint

2118
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Is this

2119
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,224
Fever to tell

2120
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
The great albums

2121
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,064
Okay

2122
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Gary Condit

2123
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Iraq

2124
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
Solid

2125
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,792
He's going to get to

2126
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,328
He's going to get to economics

2127
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,096
A little bit

2128
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:16,704
Just like Starbucks

2129
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,200
Precipitously

2130
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,504
Purchases dropping

2131
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,880
25%

2132
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,416
And none of its right Michelle

2133
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,144
Everyone just said you know what

2134
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,752
Hotel

2135
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,312
Coffee is Starbucks

2136
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:03,040
Everett

2137
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:05,600
Starbucks

2138
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
You know I'm not booking with your hotel and you know that

2139
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:19,680
George Ward. Not the other way around

2140
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
Starbucks hates your fam

2141
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,776
Is this is a freedom fries

2142
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,336
Situation

2143
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:28,896
And it's all just because

2144
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,920
Stripes bar

2145
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,456
Dan

2146
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
How about those

2147
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:35,040
It's all just because Starbucks said they were going to hire Refuge

2148
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,832
Well they said they were

2149
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,112
Did you not read

2150
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
Presser

2151
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,416
Starbucks

2152
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
We will give jobs

2153
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,792
Invader

2154
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,352
You know this is lava

2155
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,168
Everyone's like to play video games

2156
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,800
The Vets I like

2157
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
Flashback

2158
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:00,384
8 months earlier

2159
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,176
Hiring vets

2160
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
Suck it

2161
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,504
Totally right

2162
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:08,064
Completely lying about calling hotels

2163
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,880
What why would you even pretend

2164
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:17,792
I've ever heard your dumbass

2165
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:25,216
Even if you are against Starbucks and if you're an Alex Jones listener in there like

2166
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,520
Starbucks is hiring Muslim

2167
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,312
At best you're going to be like

2168
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
Donuts

2169
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,176
Starbucks

2170
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:34,944
Is your only option

2171
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,224
You got to get the

2172
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,000
Make breakfast

2173
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,536
Flat cakes

2174
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,120
I'm done

2175
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,448
But I don't even want to play it

2176
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,264
It's just a dumb sales pitch

2177
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:04,640
I'm just I don't hear his voice anymore

2178
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,176
That's actually

2179
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,760
2017 Alex Jones

2180
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,784
Is just

2181
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,576
He's not what I want

2182
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,856
He's not good

2183
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,904
It's really scary

2184
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,744
Monitoring him and what have you

2185
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,768
But

2186
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:25,632
Boy 2015 is such a better time

2187
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,936
Wendy said I retreated into 20

2188
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
15

2189
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,264
You are waylaid

2190
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:33,824
Good long while now

2191
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Like

2192
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,200
This is

2193
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,272
Yeah

2194
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,320
Like this is no fun

2195
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,344
To listen to

2196
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
And it's just

2197
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
Very much

2198
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,672
Elizabeth speaks

2199
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:51,232
Killed

2200
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:55,072
That's all

2201
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,400
You know never sighting anything just saying that everyone's trying to

2202
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,168
To kill the president

2203
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,984
That's not accurate at all

2204
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,264
If you're going to pull

2205
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,056
Bulshit like that

2206
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,080
Just look at the facts

2207
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,872
Networks

2208
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,664
Turn the TV's off

2209
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,248
There's no law that can

2210
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,784
No

2211
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:21,184
Specific examples about people who are calling for

2212
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,464
Bizarrely celebrities

2213
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
3 celebrities

2214
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
Cuz it follows up on the

2215
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,448
Hollywood Elite

2216
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,496
Right right there is that

2217
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,288
But it all just feels like

2218
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:38,848
Employees

2219
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,688
Top-heavy

2220
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,760
But like working actors

2221
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
General ER

2222
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,088
Commercial

2223
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,112
But like

2224
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:54,464
This gear is

2225
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:57,536
If I had to put a bow a bow on

2226
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,864
Got the feeling that I get is that we're watching

2227
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,656
The beginning of

2228
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,192
Something that is about to get out of

2229
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,472
Like

2230
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:08,800
I don't think necessarily that

2231
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,824
Civil War is

2232
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
Insurrection

2233
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,176
But I do think

2234
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,480
Activate the rhetoric that Alex is throwing around

2235
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
It's probably going to

2236
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,040
To get to a point where he can't

2237
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
Control it anymore

2238
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,112
He's going to radicalize his audience

2239
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Take on a life

2240
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,208
Beyond him

2241
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,768
Oh and he's already experienced that new

2242
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,536
His career

2243
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,840
Like he's responsible for a lot of people

2244
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,864
Going down the

2245
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,888
Conspiracy palette

2246
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,912
Realizing

2247
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,472
Realizing in like a quote on quote

2248
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,752
Israel is

2249
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:39,520
The problem

2250
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,056
And then turning on Alex

2251
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,848
It's because they think he's a Zionist chill

2252
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:46,432
Rat he already have radicalized tons of people to out-and-out lights

2253
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,968
Soupremacy because of that

2254
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,016
Like because of because of

2255
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,040
His actions

2256
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:54,112
And because of the rhetoric that he uses on his show

2257
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,696
He has had people like go to the go beyond

2258
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,256
I know if people are listening to this

2259
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,792
And they've had the lead up

2260
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
Of the last

2261
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
6 month

2262
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,168
They're going to kill the president they're trying to kill him

2263
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:11,008
We're on under attack from all sides

2264
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
There always are

2265
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,312
Beyond hello

2266
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,384
Alert

2267
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,200
The only outcome that can really come from it

2268
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
Him losing

2269
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,760
Control of his audience

2270
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
Again

2271
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,576
And in a much worse way

2272
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:26,624
Yeah they just people going to storm front

2273
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,416
Hangouts

2274
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,184
The only thing

2275
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:30,720
Genuinely

2276
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:34,816
As far as

2277
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
Like another

2278
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,168
Another like Malay

2279
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,472
What were the fox

2280
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,752
Occupied

2281
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:44,032
Snow park for some dumb reason

2282
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,592
Cliven Bundy

2283
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,920
Ammon Bundy

2284
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,200
Really doing

2285
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,040
What does the does the guys that I see is a

2286
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,064
As a real three

2287
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,112
Keepers are pretty big group

2288
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,416
There a lot of folks

2289
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,184
Like that

2290
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,512
I mean you see it every time that there is a

2291
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,792
One of these marches

2292
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
There's always

2293
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,584
Counter protest

2294
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,864
The everything and

2295
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,400
I mean it

2296
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:16,032
Society does have a lot of problems that we need to address

2297
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,616
Liberal problem some of them were conservative problem

2298
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,200
And level-headed people could take a look at all of them

2299
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:25,248
I hopefully come to a conclusion

2300
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,040
They works for everybody

2301
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,600
I buy professorship flying around

2302
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:30,880
Impossible

2303
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:35,488
But I see things getting worse

2304
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,048
Preparing for it

2305
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:38,816
Nope

2306
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Because I refuse

2307
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:40,864
Is to buy a gun

2308
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,888
Alex Jones

2309
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:45,728
Which I mean again

2310
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:48,544
That's the other angle that we're being remiss

2311
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
In a little bit

2312
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,616
What if he is difficult

2313
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:54,176
He doesn't have an agenda

2314
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,712
Really this is

2315
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Is just about Sal

2316
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,528
You call first

2317
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
It's like icing

2318
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Cialix

2319
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,184
That we saw

2320
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,464
Was

2321
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:09,792
Yeah it's supposed to be a lot more like that then

2322
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:10,816
Straight up

2323
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,096
He's bought his own bulshit

2324
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:15,168
Well I think in 2015 he was huckster with a philosopher

2325
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:19,008
Like the globalists are still there but it mostly in service is selling

2326
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:21,824
It is

2327
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,104
It is

2328
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:24,896
Like he's barely even

2329
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,664
Veiling

2330
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
Globalist

2331
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Like

2332
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,576
Easier

2333
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,904
This episode that we've gone over possibly

2334
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,440
No he's still talking about the Volvo

2335
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
What's all the time

2336
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,024
If somebody wasn't

2337
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
Puyallup

2338
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:45,376
I just feel like so far that the app

2339
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,912
Target

2340
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,704
The more specific ones

2341
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,240
RN

2342
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,264
Anything liberal

2343
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Yeah but is that

2344
01:54:55,616 --> 01:55:00,224
It's like I don't think it liberalism is authoritarianism in disguise

2345
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,296
Liberalism is just b*******

2346
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:05,088
The tries to get us to socialism

2347
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,648
Which will lead to Communism which will lead to Authority

2348
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,952
That is his world

2349
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,000
Every liberal value

2350
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
Is 1

2351
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,536
Creeping step

2352
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Closer

2353
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,328
To this

2354
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,608
Communist night

2355
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,888
That he thinks

2356
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
We will head to her

2357
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,960
So yeah it is

2358
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:25,056
Still got everything liberal

2359
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:31,200
Protocols of the elders

2360
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,224
Zion

2361
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,528
ISO

2362
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,600
This has been a bummer but

2363
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,904
If you want two more bikes

2364
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,440
Yeah please

Look it up on iTunes download that

2373
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
Send it around

2374
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
Libreview

2375
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:09,088
There's a button on the website appreciate it

2376
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
Stop right there

2377
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,648
If you want to

2378
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
You can do it

2379
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,744
You figure it the f*** out how but you

2380
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,560
Good luck

2381
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:26,752
Ufirst exactly

2382
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,032
Soaps for

2383
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,080
Reconciliation in Dayton

2384
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:33,152
Our kind of dying all around us I feel like

2385
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
It seems like that is

2386
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,992
Cooperation is

2387
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,272
It's on its last leg

2388
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,320
But is there any silver lining

2389
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:44,672
I can think of only one thing that will brighten our day when everything is looking

2390
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,440
Dark

2391
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,720
Rapoport

2392
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:56,704
