1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex

5
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,680
Indeed we are. I have a quick question for you sir

6
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Today is Tuesday

7
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,920
Got my booster I got boosted

8
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
Real side effects to speak a little bit of a sore shoulder

9
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
Situation going on but

10
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
I was worried that there would be severe side effects not because I'm black

11
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Vaccine skeptical

12
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,120
But because I went to a Walgreens to get the booster

13
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
And I texted you about it. Good something was wrong there was a bad vibe

14
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
In this Walgreens

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
I went did

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,432
There were too few people where was it

17
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,040
Which which one it was in uptown is a little ways away

18
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,928
Walgreens hasn't been there for 10 years old yeah I couldn't get that one in a close

19
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
To me it's a little bit of a trip but like

20
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Yeah right there was like

21
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,656
There were there weren't enough people in there I don't know what that means but I could definitely felt it

22
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,704
Shoppers staff

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,056
Everybody there's just not enough not enough the lighting was wrong

24
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
The area where they had people go to

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:36,160
To get the shot the little back office room look like a holding cell

26
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Drip

27
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Coming from the ceiling one lights cutting in and out all the time like other Walgreens that I've been

28
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Been to in my life I've been to pharmacies

29
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
You know I've seen the area where they have like consultations

30
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,128
MinuteClinic kind of Heaven aesthetic

31
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Beatles

32
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,248
Comfort Inn at least office play

33
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,880
Looked like a biohazard container

34
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Then I didn't everything was fine with the right back seat immune to malaria

35
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
That's for damn sure

36
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,704
Yeah so is

37
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
The teachers have gone to remote learning my partner of course has a teacher in the

38
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
CPS

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
And what's right about that spot is that when they went to take a vote

40
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,016
On whether or not to

41
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
2

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,904
Say f*** you to the administration we're going to go remote and let the chips fall where they may

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
88% voted yes

44
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Banana

45
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
Stronger than the teachers union in Chicago

46
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
88% to agree on something means

47
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
God damn everybody was like this

48
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,568
Is f***** up so I'm very very proud of all of them for doing that and nobody break

49
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
In the goddamn

50
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Hell yeah

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Hell yeah

52
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Congratulations

53
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
So Jordan hey guess what it's our anniversary

54
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
It is our anniversary five years

55
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Yeah that's right

56
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
January 7th

57
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,143
Was the first episode of the show back in 2017

58
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Anniversary

59
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:29,055
Combining that with the fact that we recording this on the anniversary of January 6th

60
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,455
You don't we was our first episode recorded on January 6th

61
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Might have been the 5th but it could have been yeah yeah I'm not sure

62
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,439
I was very much even from the beginning like we have

63
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Quick turnaround

64
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
I've always operated

65
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
I think that means that the two most important things I mean there's the one

66
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
That's an interesting take on

67
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
That's cuz it's better probably to get him to take her to either we closet

68
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
Connection between the two of them perhaps

69
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
So I kind of combined

70
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
A bit of this

71
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Hit my head and in my emotion

72
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
And I combine this with the fact that

73
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
You know our last episode

74
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Alex was trying to

75
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
I quit real real bad time

76
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
And I turned on the 5th

77
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
Shows up 14 minutes late and I almost immediately have Mike issues until I got to go off air

78
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,151
F****** tired of that perfect distillation of the show

79
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
So tired of this dude

80
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:45,087
Until I decided we're going to go back to the past so today worry 2003

81
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
We're going over the episode that

82
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Played

83
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
July 11th two

84
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Okay right

85
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Sure

86
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
But when was it recorded

87
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
July

88
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
2000

89
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,471
2003 3 days different so I told you

90
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
That we had skipped

91
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
The 8th and the 9th

92
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
In 2003 because the audio was unlistenable

93
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
The 11th is a rebroadcast

94
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,319
Get out of here

95
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
But this is the episode where Paul Joseph Watson

96
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
Sometimes on a very young Paul Joseph Watson

97
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
And he's promoting his book

98
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
Until I decided I was give this a whirl

99
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
It's our anniversary this is for me I don't give a s*** I'm not covering the present today

100
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
I'm going back to the past

101
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
I figure that like

102
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,311
There's going to be something

103
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
For the SEC

104
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
You know like

105
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Something there's going to be

106
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Trump has his

107
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
Rally's Superior happening today sure there's going to be something

108
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
That is going to be wild and we'll cover that on Monday

109
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
No I I hope not

110
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
What are

111
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Okay

112
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
You know what let's just do today alright

113
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
So first

114
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Lydia and all her gay frogs thank you so much you're now policy want

115
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,175
Next time Alex has swollen neck

116
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
I'm a policy wonk

117
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,039
Thank you very much next to this person's been but the way they

118
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
Praise that in the message was possible

119
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
That's impossible

120
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:31,839
Possible

121
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
I'm a policy wonk

122
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,239
Sable the chalk forever and I will walk thank you so much

123
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:43,871
Disable dr. Little Goat

124
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
I'm a policy wonk

125
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Dr. Little Goat

126
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
1 degree

127
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
The Goat restaurant in Chicago there's like a girl in a goat

128
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Is it

129
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Good that is a bunch of restaurants of goat

130
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Amazing

131
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Amazed

132
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
So before we get down to business on today's episode I wanted to quickly touch on piece of news that was breaking

133
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Since we recorded our last episode

134
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,991
On December 30th a man named Thomas Apollo showed up at a clinic

135
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
In Tustin California

136
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,111
People who are working there giving a vaccination

137
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
Accusing the people of being murderers and they were making people sick

138
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
According to an article in the washer

139
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
YouTube post quote

140
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
Families together said that the members sustained serious injuries and was sent to the hospital in an ambulance

141
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
But they both workers are expected to make a full recovery Within

142
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
In a few days

143
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
Obviously given the publicly available information I can't sit here and tell you that this guy was a fan of Alex

144
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Or that was part of it

145
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
And isn't Brasher but honestly I don't even think that's an important aspect of the story

146
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
For our purpose

147
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,159
An attack like this was inevitable given the extreme quality of the rhetoric that's flying around

148
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Conspiracy and misinformation circles

149
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
You can't prank convince a large group of people that vaccinations are intentional plot

150
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,167
To kill their children and not think that some of them are going to take the next logical step

151
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
And try to attack people providing vaccinations

152
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,871
Even Alex knew that which is why he was building up this narrative in advance as we saw last week

153
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
And they're going to Stage Terror attacks and they're going to everything else in Guaymas

154
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,831
Do you understand that will say on the news that my followers blow up the Pfizer building or something like that

155
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
I know I know

156
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,607
We've talked about this a hundred times in the course of doing the show it's clear why a person like Alex would behave this way

157
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,727
His entire career has been made off of profiting from tragedy so I don't believe for a second

158
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
But he's not rooting for tragedies

159
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Strike

160
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
At the same time when tragedy does strike

161
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
It's good for business

162
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,247
Business to make sure that the audience doesn't start to question whether or not the media they're digesting is part of Woods Drive in Vista

163
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
Having a prebuilt story in place of the audience blame someone else is critical

164
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
That's why I was doing this kind of thing

165
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
I just want to take a little moment at the beginning here to to point out this

166
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
Very clear dynamic

167
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
This the cycle that's in play

168
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,423
I'm going to Alex's talking about like the bombing of a Pfizer building or something

169
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Extreme example but

170
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,799
I don't believe for a second Alex wouldn't say that this attack of

171
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
This assault of people at a vaccine clinic wasn't a false flag

172
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
Exactly what he's priming is audience to deny is real

173
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
I'm not so coarse why you use the example of

174
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Blowing up

175
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
The Pfizer building because that's that sort of like

176
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
Hyperbolic strawman that is well safe you think that they would go blow up the Pfizer building not just go

177
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
F*** around with this place over here which

178
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
More likely to be what they do you go

179
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
Near home and I like the blowing of the Pfizer building cuz that's like your prediction inside like a

180
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Looks like these are the terrorist attacks

181
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,175
I have like everything less than that covered exact

182
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,807
You don't act like a dick

183
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
So yeah I find I find this

184
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
I don't know

185
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Shity

186
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,839
It's just the inevitable consequence of allowing this type of s*** to

187
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
That's just what it is

188
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
So it in the same way that we've just decided that this is how it is for so many

189
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
I guess this is just how it's going to be one of the reasons why

190
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Did it really talk about like

191
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Why alot of his rhetoric

192
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
These kinds of

193
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Propaganda

194
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Disseminating

195
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Structures are dangerous

196
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
These are the things that, from it

197
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,303
Right and thankfully I mean I hate to say this

198
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
But made it sound

199
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
Minimizing I don't mean it too but thankfully

200
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
No one died

201
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
It was an assault

202
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,823
Not like a shooting or

203
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
F

204
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
So let's go back 2000

205
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
A pleasant sort of

206
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
It's not all that Pleasant

207
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
I was going to have Paul Wall

208
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Bring it

209
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Cowboys

210
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Order out

211
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Hearing that clipping

212
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Books being released I realized that I'd never

213
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Actually read that book

214
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
I knew that he had it I was worried existed but I never really felt any real interest

215
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
How to get down to it

216
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,527
I got the sense of what it was about the title order out of chaos like I was just going to be about that

217
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
The conspiracy idea of the hegelian dialectic

218
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
Fight beside in preparation near to give it a read

219
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
Bring up anything that Alex hasn't talked about on the show already

220
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
Everything is a false flag with its done by the Elites in order to

221
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
Increase their power you know the drill

222
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,727
I thought that maybe you would be good idea to discuss the specifics of the book but I realize that but

223
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,823
10 pages into it I had six pages of notes explaining the things that he got wrong

224
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Search felt like this too big of an undertaking for just a normal Xbox out

225
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,343
Maybe another day I'll record a 13-hour breakdown review of Paul's book but that day is not today

226
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Interesting fun fact though

227
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
This is the only book that appears

228
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
Ever been published by a EJ production

229
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Switch of course transfer Alex Emerick Jones

230
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:00,703
AutoZone book 911 descent into tyranny was published by a different company called the progressive

231
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Suppress

232
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,519
Who's the publisher that put out a bunch

233
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Books written by Alex's buddy Webster

234
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
But also books written

235
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
By Henry Makow

236
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
A dude who is a stop

237
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
Really just doesn't like the Jews at all

238
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
He recently wrote an article titled quote the riddle of anti-semitism

239
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
The 87th is amazing quotes

240
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Yeah yeah I would have

241
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
I would have expected scare quotes around that one

242
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
It's not great

243
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
You're correct

244
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Here's how it starts

245
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
Quote is growing is the covid

246
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
Scam is correctly identified with organize jewelry Freemasonry and communism

247
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
No one can justify genocide but the stigma attached to Disturbia Define control

248
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
There's no but his legitimate resistance to the pernicious agenda of organized jewelry in Fremont

249
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
Masonry IE the New World Order

250
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Bananas a little later he drops this gem

251
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,631
Most Jews and non-jews are unaware that since Antiquity Jews

252
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Consistently been revealed

253
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
For a good reason

254
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
Jews are in a state of willful denial

255
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,103
They don't realize that Judaism is governed by Kabbalah which is satanism

256
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,711
The existence of Judaism is to take God's Place destroy Christianity and disp

257
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Possess non-jew

258
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,551
Seriously ideas that he has Express

259
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,391
On a recent basis of trust me if you cruise around this website you'll see that

260
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
He's had this position his whole career

261
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
He's also been friends with Leo zagami for a bit so that's

262
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:37,471
You know is it's not something that we talked about you often but there is that element of

263
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Genocide already

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
That always includes the like

265
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
Lest you worry that you can

266
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
Talk to them or even communicate with them

267
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
They don't even know

268
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,063
They can't even understand that they're working with the Devil

269
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
So don't worry about it

270
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
Don't worry about communicating with them and asking them any question

271
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Cuz I can't

272
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
That you're not you're not going to be able to get to the bottom of this by investigating it or experiences

273
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
No point in doing anything yep just

274
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
Play back to Poulsbo

275
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
If you read the dedications he includes this

276
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,311
Alex Jones for awakening me to the New World Order in Publisher

277
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Sing this book

278
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
Bulkhead even write the dedication to his book without lion

279
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
2013 interview with Luke rudowski

280
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
From we are change Paul said quote

281
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
Don't tell Alex it was actually David Icke that woke me up

282
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Liar

283
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Wow

284
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,559
Have an identity of his own back in 2003 so it's good practice to flatter the person who's willing to advance his career cuz it's certainly

285
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Wasn't David Icke at that point

286
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,983
2013 Paul's in a much more secure position they can give to his real intellectual father figure

287
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
The turd in the punch bowl himself David

288
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
That's something that I'm Amazed

289
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Did someone would admit open

290
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Honestly

291
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
I would prefer to have been woken up by Alex as opposed to David Icke the third figure

292
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
Play as we get through

293
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Okay

294
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
Paul's going to be coming up on the show but there's another guess

295
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
All your clothes

296
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Call Greg

297
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Accurate

298
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Manipulate

299
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Neutralized

300
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
I'm really curious about how this this isn't packing

301
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
No it sounds right

302
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
I don't I don't I have no idea

303
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Well in 2003 that's hacking

304
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,863
I'm really confused on the specifics of this

305
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Crunch when you use the slide whistle into the Payphone alright you can mimic the sounds and then you make calls for free

306
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Osher

307
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Bright

308
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Right all right

309
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:28,991
Phone free so first of all the notion of putting RFID chips and all your clothes to Tracy who is a fear

310
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Probably shouldn't be taken seriously

311
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
Is it conceivably possible with the technology

312
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
I'm probably but what's more important is if it's a practice

313
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
Plan that any evil entity would go for

314
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
The hurdles to this kind of scheme would be gigantic

315
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
And some of them are pretty much insurmountable

316
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,007
Even if they knew what shirt you bought to trace you through how are these folks know if you gave that shirt to someone else as a gift

317
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,895
What is there trying to trace you but unfortunately put a chip in the pair of pants that you don't like that much or maybe you grew out of

318
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,015
These are just behavioral concerns completely leaving aside the Absurd technological problems

319
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,087
Of isolating individual signals that would be coming in

320
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,695
If all people's clothes are tagged you also tagged the gift receipt

321
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,023
So that way if they return them or give them away you have

322
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,607
But then somebody's got to

323
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Figure out how to transfer the tag

324
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,495
From the gift receipt before the person throws a ride

325
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
That's why you need a hand

326
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,127
2003 iPhone hasn't come out yet

327
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
I would imagine that this sort of like they're going to track you through your clothes narrative drop by the wayside 1C iPhone showed up and

328
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,111
David Federer

329
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Could be like good guys a few years later

330
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
You would

331
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Bankofam to track you

332
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
You will

333
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,375
Wait in line overnight for them to know exactly where you are at all times

334
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,983
A couple years later they probably felt so relieved

335
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Didn't have to do this

336
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Nonsensical they're going to track your shirts thing

337
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,503
This is so much easier

338
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
Catherine Albrecht is a radio host in a demagogue who's Big claim to fame is like being on that RFID train

339
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Real early

340
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
And apparently she coined the term spy chips

341
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
Because that is a popular term

342
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Nope

343
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
So she began his organization Caspian which sounds a lot better than what it stands for which is consumers against Supermarket private

344
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
The Invasion and numbering

345
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,943
This is a group that Advocates that stores shouldn't have frequent Shopper cards are loyalty programs

346
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:40,319
Had a kind of moonlight the B by fighting off the RFID chip as the mark of the beast

347
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Love this group

348
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Listen I want more innocuous lunatics none of this anti-vax loyalty program

349
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
I f****** join that group

350
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,911
I'm sure there's a way you could go bad

351
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
I just thought maybe we haven't

352
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Explored it too much

353
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,639
Enough to figure out the exact way it's whenever they want me to go

354
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Send off

355
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,527

Discreet pass

421
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
3bros can just get

422
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120

423
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,472

00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
Also this is such a fun topic for them to be talking about because Alex is entire show is about like police of Prayer

426
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,832
Fashion and all this police state nonsense and it illegal to have

427
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
In Austin 1101

428
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:36,512
One cares no one cares or works or cannons

429
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
You just begging for them to impress me more it but

430
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
People turned a blind eye cuz it's under

431
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,960
Stood.

432
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:50,848
Loser hand almost his entire

433

Assertive

434
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Ideology

435
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
At least a large portion of

436
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,064
Unspoken agreement between power and not so

437
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
Analysis world because they're looking for every opportunity to jam you up

438
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:13,376
Your political ideology that is in need of being a jammed up and if your political ideology involves

439
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Combustible

440
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:22,080
Whether it's a gun or a firework obsessed with taking away your guns

441
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
You think cannons would be a little bit

442
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Stop up there

443
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
You think so

444
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Turns out

445
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Okay

446
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,016
Anyway

447
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Ino

448
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Alex

449
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
I can relate to what he's about to get into here

450
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
Sometimes loses the fire

451
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
For his job

452
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Dinner

453
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Sometimes

454
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Loses the fire

455
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Camp

456
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Getting Susie Astic

457
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,192
Think about what he's doing sometimes I run into that

458
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Chirality

459
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:55,616
Quitting his show and having outbursts of a little talk about it it's the same number again

460
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
But Alex has a private

461
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
True method

462
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
Forgetting that fire back

463
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
And I I kind of admire this

464
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Perfume

465
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Will

466
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
On the radio

467
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
How to do interviews

468
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Lucifer

469
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Where am I

470
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Radio

471
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Aw

472
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
And I

473
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
Rove

474
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
New World Order

475
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
With me

476
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
4 Yuan

477
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
So Alex whatever loses a fire

478
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
He listens to other stations to get pissed off and then he calls in using a dumb voice

479
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,008
Just anger that's so sad well I think it's probably

480
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
Pretty obvious by this point not really a revelation

481
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,688
Just anger

482
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
Nothing else

483
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
He needs to be poked

484
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Buy something is poking Emmett's

485
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Call in doing this down voice

486
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
But sometimes it doesn't work

487
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,936
Because I can't believe it

488
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,496
Just like call screeners don't want to put them on the air

489
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:35,360
Horseman at this I think is a problem for the Constitution

490
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Cobalt

491
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
Bring up the heat

492
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,424
Alex

493
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
Prodigy

494
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Why not

495
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
The president

496
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Neocon

497
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Is owned by Bush

498
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
Right but it's not cuz I got sold to a conglomerate

499
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,320
Yeah

500
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,160
Talkin about this dude on the are either

501
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
I appreciate

502
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
Many parts of this call screener

503
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,096
I appreciate

504
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
Howard somehow a slimy ghost

505
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Call screeners call screeners not Power Trip

506
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,176
Schedule screen calls

507
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Sure I'll let you on the air but you must

508
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
Solve a riddle

509
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Clearly the patience with which

510
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
That call screener listen to Alex

511
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,952
Both in and out of his accent because I

512
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,512
Very strongly doubt he could keep it up for that

513
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Sure could visit like the 10 a.m.

514
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:07,424
That calls printer definitely heard Alex drop it and then repeat it in the in the voice

515
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
I see how still managed to get through the whole

516
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
Even asked a follow-up question

517
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,384
What else dum-dum I have a spoiler for what's that

518
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Greener interact

519
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
Didn't happen

520
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
Didn't happen like that I am I will guarantee that if I were if

521
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
If I were call screener and I were trying to run a professional program

522
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
I would not

523
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,584
Somebody on the air who's just going to clearly try and derail things

524
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,888
With nonsense conspiracies that

525
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,728
That we don't need that we've got over a hundred times

526
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,080
And that does sound like something you would say because you hate the concert

527
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
The tution and the founding fathers

528
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,528
Who died for your right to go on any radio show whenever you want to say whatever you

529
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:59,136
First amendment that number one amend

530
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
I think it's really revealing

531
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,512
That this is his understanding of the Constitution

532
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
And what free speech mean

533
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,656
Radio stations in Boston

534
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
Benjamin

535
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
Franklin got

536
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
Posts dumb s*** in the newspaper under a fake ass name I get to call into WM

537
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,664
NPP and say bulshit

538
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
But what if like they can only take six calls and your caller 8

539
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Or whatever

540
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
Right

541
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
So dumb

542
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
The second amendment was about abolishing time limit

543
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
So dumb

544
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,072
McKee really means this

545
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
But one

546
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:07,744
Couple things I'm going to guess that most of those four people didn't actually call them sold out

547
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,144
Throw that one in the

548
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,496
Alex took 15 calls and one of them was

549
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Like

550
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Someone was supposed to vaccines

551
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,128
So that kind of hurts his argument that they weren't letting anybody on

552
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Wow

553
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,712
Maybe they just had like I'm not going to let someone on who's

554
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,856
Spouting. What they're talking about I want somebody who's going to make those

555
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Peoplelooker

556
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Stupid

557
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Free pizza

558
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
Cool

559
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
Very interesting

560
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
I would save it for somebody who loves

561
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
The Constitution

562
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
Is a

563
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
4

564
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,544
Is a First Amendment absolute

565
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:59,200
He doesn't know I mean just because he believes that that station because it disagrees with

566
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Temp should be taken off the air forever

567
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,344
By the federal government doesn't mean he doesn't believe in the First Amendment dance

568
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
It's just outrageous

569
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,840
Even going back to 2003 I was at a very strange

570
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,960
Position cuz he he really desperately doesn't want to be seen as anti-vax

571
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
As a whole

572
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
Because that's

573
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Admittedly very dumb

574
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
Yeah trying to say that

575
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
Like inoculation to things

576
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Doesn't work

577
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
Is it really tough

578
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Climb

579
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,088
Denying the actual science of vaccination is

580
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
That's a game that Alex doesn't want to play

581
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
I mean when your conversation goes like this

582
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Vaccines don't work

583
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Do you have polio

584
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
All right so they work sometimes

585
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
Then you can't be all the antibiotics will get all of the numbers of diseases that have essentially been eradicated

586
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,288
Let's go down the list

587
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,872
But whatever I guess that's one angle you could take

588
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
It'd be tough to figure out what exactly is different to play is like I would love it if x

589
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
We're cool

590
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,064
I would love it

591
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Totally butt

592
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:14,208
Evil people make them

593
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
Ygorganization

594
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
We didn't have all the ra

595
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Femur

596
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Mycoplasma

597
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Mother

598
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
No

599
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
Health boo

600
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,808
I'm not talkin about these specific things that he's bringing up and rattling because they're all things

601
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
We've discussed

602
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
In past and it's all nonsense

603
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
I think the

604
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Crowning nonsense is this idea that there would ever be

605
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,400
Some kind of an organization that is trustworthy enough for a Lakota

606
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,728
You know like a look

607
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
All of these other companies right

608
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Scientist

609
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
And

610
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Public Health

611
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,408
Non-governmental organization

612
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
They're all f******

613
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
But this one

614
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
There's a good guy

615
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
No it's what we need is a

616
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:53,024
Patriot Maxine maker because here's the here's how exhausted you get with them

617
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
And that's why they win

618
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
That's why they've won for the past 30 years

619
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
They're 40th

620
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Is

621
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,496
They will say anything and then you go

622
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Okay fine

623
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
What does it take

624
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
For you to just shut up

625
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
Okay you want to do if your your organization fight

626
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
You give us rules

627
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
Well I need my dad to run Pfizer

628
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,768
You're just never going to shut up are you I've already agreed to do whatever it was to tell you to shut up and now you won't shut up look f******

629
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:29,376
My dad needs to be in charge of Pfizer

630
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,520
That means he can run out of action,

631
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
All right to work and put him in charge Mike Adams health

632
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,552
Gives a lot of great advice third of course

633
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:53,952
Get a weirdo let's get a real weirdo

634
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
Everybody votes on the weirdest weirdo we can find that's number three who's nuts

635
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,192
Every four years

636
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
I don't know Lord monckton

637
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Shut up

638
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,992
So the problem that Alex has really is that the global

639
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,808
Was there trying to make more and more vaccines man

640
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
There was a Alzheimer's vaccine candidate that wasn't trials in 2003

641
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
And the trials were abandoned

642
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:56,416
I say unfortunately because follow-up studies of people in those trials found that he quote halted and even reverse the brain disease

643
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
He's in some who got the shot

644
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
Obviously there are severe side effects

645
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
That's the case like it was in

646
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,656
In this case with 18 out of 300 patients getting brain inflammation

647
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,752
It may not be something that you can justify going any further with but

648
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
The idea that

649
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
There was some promise for a cure there was really exciting

650
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,248
Anybody's ever loved ones Alzheimer could tell you that it's pretty hellish Prospect or a canopy and a vaccine would be huge

651
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
The lessons learned from these trials in for further research and it's still ongoing

652
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
With a new trial beginning in late 2021

653
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,952
For a nasally administered vaccine

654
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,256
That looks to slow the progression

655
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:36,096
Yeah there's Prospectors things are happening this year

656
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
There have been

657
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Nicotine vaccines that have been developed

658
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,520
But a 2008 article in the journal expert opinion on biological therapy

659
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,592
It discusses the state of these vaccines are the found the quote

660
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:51,712
Although these therapies have had some success relapse within a year is still high

661
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
So it's not really

662
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
The strategy the people think is like this is where we're going to go

663
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,696
I think one of the big problems that we have with vaccinations is that like

664
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
Easy

665
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,048
Slip into like all these are mandatory vaccinations

666
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
The way we should

667
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
Should sell it to people is with like

668
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Hey guess what

669
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,288
We're going to eradicated disease this year to go down this path of conversation because

670
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,688
They're like first about there's not anybody who's a serious voice on 2003 advocating to either of these vaccines be mandatory for

671
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
People to take that's just not a position that have

672
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
That's a fake Point Alex

673
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
Degrading to argue against

674
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,416
Because the specifics album bolster this idea that every year doesn't more vaccines

675
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
Become mandatory

676
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Which is nonsense

677
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
Mandatory I think we should all come together and eradicate the disease together

678
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
I think it's at framing is what you want to use that great but also you need to know that the federal government doesn't require

679
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Any vaccine

680
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,592
That's a state-level issue

681
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:55,199
Which is why the ability for people to get various exceptions for things like school-related vaccine

682
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
It varies wildly

683
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
From state-to-state

684
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
Federal government and all the entities like the CDC recommendations on what people should be getting

685
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,719
How many states want to require you to get them

686
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
Musical shops be allowed to go to school

687
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
That's up to the state

688
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Zolo debosier

689
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,399
Throwing out

690
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Position

691
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Melody ideas

692
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:22,335
Doing with the vaccine

693
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,895
In the current day but I don't

694
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
You can make

695
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
An analogy between

696
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,735
Some of these things

697
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Like

698
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Measles

699
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,599
Rrr Sandra Bella

700
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,159
Yeah shots did some states require

701
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
For people to go to school

702
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Mandan Act

703
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Pandemic

704
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,535
There are relevant difference

705
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,863
Is there a 2000

706
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
This this notion that the government

707
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Just trying to make

708
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Vaccines mandatory

709
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
State-level

710
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,871
And based on Alex's politics you should have no problem with that even if he's opposed

711
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
Yeah cuz he's the states

712
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,991
You get to choose these things

713
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,831
You know if you don't like it you can move to another state

714
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Good answer to things

715
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,439
Politics in his positions on other things

716
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
That's

717
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,863
But you should believe me it's almost like this whole separation between federal and state government is kind of arbitrary bass tab

718
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,703
Find whatever it is he feels like his position should be at any given point in time

719
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
You bet

720
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,799
Also like he's trained his has to pretend

721
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
That it's not a state thing

722
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
But you have to pretend that it

723
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,967
The demand of the federal government is trying to

724
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Force you to get these shots because otherwise is Ark

725
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Falls apart

726
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
That's unfair you should have to get you

727
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
Look if a if a Band-Aid happens you get

728
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
To play that card

729
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
You can't just play a Joker

730
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,047
That's not fair

731
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
There's got to be rules to the game

732
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,143
Makeup it's a federal thing

733
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
That's unfair

734
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,495
I don't like it well that's what happens when you deal with Liars

735
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
So appalled

736
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
Joseph Watson

737
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,359
Pjw

738
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,151
Apostle Paul

739
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:07,551
Shows up no he's not

740
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
He's not figured out his thing

741
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
But

742
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,671
Alex Alex gives him quite a long

743
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
Introduction that I think is

744
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Really dumb

745
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Started

746
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Because

747
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,551
Alright go f*** yourself

748
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:43,903
I don't work with many people cuz they're

749
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
Also

750
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,327
Don't work with people cuz they're not constitutionalist but you work at both British

751
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,887
That's cuz he loves the Constitution so much

752
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,471
I was already revealed the first talking about it

753
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,567
The constitutionalist who lives in England

754
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
Still with the British issue was Paul

755
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,175
Come on they don't even have a car

756
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,271
Alright whatever

757
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
Most Americans

758
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Call Juan

759
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Cruise

760
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Football mouthpiece

761
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
Amanda

762
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,727
Today on the show he's got British Galileo

763
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
I like that one

764
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,799
Give me compliments

765
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:09,407
For complimenting you

766
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
So I was out today

767
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
Introduce

768
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,343
The earlier when you're discussing the dedications of Poulsbo

769
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,391
We mentioned that

770
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
He's given two different stories about who woke him up

771
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
The different points

772
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
His career

773
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
In this interview

774
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
He might have another third

775
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
IDs

776
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Okay

777
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Third individual

778
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
Jesus Christ

779
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
The New World Order

780
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Yeah coming out

781
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
11 but

782
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
To be clear

783
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
First state or not get into death camps in England.

784
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
They do not come back to that at all I was very curious if this is that doesn't happen

785
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
The idea of paradigm

786
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
To the new world order by realize

787
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
Both ways

788
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
The right one

789
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
First place

790
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
3D

791
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,263
Liberal Channel

792
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Controlled

793
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Between Malaysia

794
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
This is a cold war

795
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
I'll be sleeping in the world

796
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
Joe

797
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Now deceased

798
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Banana explosion

799
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
Call Mina

800
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:12,031
So part of the thing that woke up Paul was the realization that the left and the right of funded by the same folks

801
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Can I come from

802
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
Him reading the work of Anthony Sutton

803
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
I use work generously

804
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
Something is most known for writing 3

805
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
Books known as The Wall Street

806
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Trilogy

807
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Wall Street in the bolster

808
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,599
Revolution is about Wall Street funding communism

809
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,231
Wall Street and FDR is by finding fpr and Wall Street and the rise of Hitler is about funding of the Nazi party

810
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:37,631
So exciting and full of insinuation and rumor these books have been absolutely Trashed by historians

811
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Who reviewed them

812
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
With one summing up the Bolshevik book this way

813
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Quote

814
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:46,335
He tells us nothing new he does repeat unsubstantiated allegations

815
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,407
Cite the relevant facts make Auto warranted conclusions

816
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
A cortisol

817
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,991
Falling Leaf pedestrian Style

818
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Ouch

819
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:59,135
Ouch little little slip-ups

820
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,975
None of the three sources Apollo cited as being the source of his Awakening are in

821
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
Anyway respect

822
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,863
We would like is a lunatic Alex is a narcissistic liar and Anthony Sutton to work

823
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
Critically flawed

824
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
Boils down to unconfirmed

825
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Conspiracy.

826
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
So I

827
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
This is bad

828
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
I mean

829
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,919
It doesn't get more Father Son and Holy Ghost though that's right there

830
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
So that would make this is bad though

831
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:30,111
Who's the who's the Father the Son is Alex and then the Holy Ghost

832
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
The Sutton cuz I assume he's dead

833
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:36,511
Yes I'm okay

834
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
Yeah Allison probably block

835
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,703
At the idea of being the Sun

836
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,055
Father in the Punchbowl

837
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
But it also

838
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
It's it's interesting to me I don't

839
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,431
I wonder if in 2003

840
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,759
If Alex had that same negative opinion of David Icke

841
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:03,135
Cuz I know that by you no periods around like 2009-2010

842
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,951
He was having David icon

843
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
Yeah Ben and bacon sort of had

844
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
Right I think I think that's tough because

845
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,935
Is Bipolar person I like to keep a mood tracker

846
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,495
Do you know if I'm going out of out of whack you know

847
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,359
And Alex has that relationship with David Icke I feel like on a day-to-day basis it's like

848
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
Like him don't like him he's at 8 today and he's a to you know what I'm saying how far is things going to feel

849
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:33,599
Depends on what your opinion of David ideas

850
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
So a little bit of a primary source to bring up about this idea that all

851
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
Old people

852
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,583
Are controlled by the same party

Chris just right

867

The Cold War

868
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
Meeting with New York

869
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,423
It is true that Kozlov was a Bohemian Grove in 1959 but

870
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,983
The question we really need to be asking ourselves

871
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,823
If newspapers were reporting on the fact that our Russian guy was a

872
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,615
Suggested Bohemian Grove in 19

873
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
1059

874
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,687
How secret was this whole thing really

875
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,063
Did Alex really do anything to expose The Grove to the world or was it something people reported on freely like

876
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
20 years before he was even born

877
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:16,511
You can find an article from 1959 even in the New York Times about cause loves visit to The Grove

878
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,351
Which according to Alex's mythology should absolutely have never happened

879
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,751
They were trying to keep this s*** under wraps

880
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,335
Never happen

881
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,919
So little known fact the folks to listen to Alex Jones

882
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,479
Actually DeLand Bohemian Grove sits on

883
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
Was originally part of our Russian calling

884
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,343
Neither dated back to 1812

885
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,927
Fisherman attempted to you form a foothold in America there the Russian

886
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
Florida College

887
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,095
It was a huge boss though as competition from other colonists elected the decimation of sea otter population

888
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
And the Russians ended up withdrawing

889
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,167
1841

890
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,727
Selling off the land to Johann Augustus Sutter

891
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,311
Sutter would go on to find gold on the land and strike it rich

892
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
God does dumb Russian

893
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,943
The Grove is on part of this land which is

894
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,759
Hip Hop's

895
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,807
That there is actually called the Russian River

896
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:17,951
Science article about this even includes the lyrics of a song that they sing at the Grove called Lament

897
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
I hear some of the lyrics

898
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,071
Why did the Russians leave it and go back to the snow

899
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
Why did they leave this Bit of Heaven will never never know

900
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,447
This New York Times article has the lyrics

901
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,519
Do things that they sing at the Grove

902
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,615
Inside

903
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,919
Put like the access

904
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
It's clear like

905
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,759
This is written by somebody

906
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
We're telling me seeing shanties from the Bohemian Grove yes I get it fixed

907
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,279
The 1959 there

908
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,815
Pretty in-depth

909
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,399
Discussion of Stanford gone on there

910
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,567
Sweetly runs counter to Alex's idea that he would have to look in with binoculars in order to see

911
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,455
Druids years before Nixon would show up and get a handy so you know it's still not secret yet

912
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
Something

913
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
Oh wait look

914
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:17,343
The conflict between the US and the Soviet Union particularly in times or a 1959

915
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
Was one that said we needed diplomacy

916
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Handle

917
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:25,535
They were our enemies on some level but there was also there what there was an estate of outright hostility

918
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:31,167
The politician like oslove would be on a diplomatic visit to the United States which he was

919
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,471
And while he was here he be invited to The Grove

920
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
It seems weird at all

921
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:39,103
I guess for Paul though it serves as proof that the u.s. in the Soviet Union

922
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
Just making the Cold War

923
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
Wait I don't understand what's diplomas

924
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
You get like

925
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:50,111
The person that you're in competition with or even at war with and you like talk to them

926
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,207
I thought war was about totally eliminating the existence of your enemy

927
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
It's mostly about screaming

928
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
Okay well that's good

929
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,447
That's one of the things we've learned for Alex over the years

930
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,751
In the

931
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
Department of State

932
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
Their Foreign Relations Journal

933
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
You can find

934
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,151
Like a long transcription

935
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,711
A conversation that cause laws

936
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,247
And Eisenhower had

937
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
That's just

938
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
I mean

939
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
How you guys been

940
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
Field Guide

941
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,183
You go fishing a lot we got this song

942
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,839
12 people saying it's depressing we miss you

943
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,007
In that New York Times article there's also like a conversation about how

944
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,335
I was very impressed by The Vineyards

945
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,151
In California but also thought that the Russians

946
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:51,551
Could teach them how to be more productive which is ironic because he ended up being thrown out of office for being

947
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,599
Later on and then

948
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:59,743
Brezhnev took over and Be Your Own Boss

949
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
You can't have the

950
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,351
Putin getting thrown out for being too drunk

951
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
No sir

952
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:10,239
So Alex gets into some conversation about this

953
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
Latest left and right saying

954
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
I honestly think that this is

955
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,431
A short clip but it's one of the most revealing things

956
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
In order

957
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
To understand Alex's Paula

958
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
When actually do

959
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
Who's this

960
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
Let me know plenty of people on the left or

961
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Proposed to Wars

962
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
Under

963
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Bush

964
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,311
As they were under Clinton

965
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,615
Name one American warrior that

966
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,711
The American left has stood up against to end like

967
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
Name one like what

968
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,015
Vietnam

969
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,879
No one will get into Maria definitely not into some ideas about

970
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,975
The opposition to the Vietnam War a little later

971
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:08,607
I think I think Alex is trying to play games here with the appearance that like under Clinton the left didn't

972
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Opposed

973
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:14,751
And maybe some people in office didn't maybe some of them fell in line

974
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,567
But in terms of anti-war activists

975
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
People who

976
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
You know that's

977
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:26,271
That they have the same position on the picket line trying to stop Wars

978
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:31,135
Also in the clip I think you see one of the most universal Hallmarks of Alex's politics

979
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:37,279
You sincerely believe that everyone makes decisions on what does support or oppose based on what the people they are against

980
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Bank

981
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,863
If my villains are in favor of something it must be bad

982
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
So I'm against

983
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
If my villains oppose something I must

984
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
Be good so I am all about it

985
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:48,543
Alex believes that other people think this way because that's how he's been

986
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:52,639
The difference for him is that the enemy he has is completely imagine

987
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:56,223
Canary and their preferences are just things that he's decided he's Dakota

988
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
From Reading headlight

989
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:03,647
Through using a psychic intuition Alex's figured out what the globalist are in favor of and this is what he opposes

990
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,975
Everything is for him is based on this kind of thinking

991
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:12,351
The globalist want people to be vaccinated therefore there must be a conspiracy involved in vaccinations are evil

992
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:16,191
The globalist are interested in conservation efforts and worried about climate change

993
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,471
Therefore that must be

994
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Conspiracy day

995
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Further some other nefarious aim

996
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,359
I was thinking about it and even in support of gun rights

997
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
It's could be seen through this prison

998
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,479
There isn't anything intrinsically bout owning a gun that Alex supports

999
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,367
His staunch gun-rights position is rooted in the belief that disarming the population is part of the plan of globalist have

1000
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,439
To take over and it's absolute martial law all over the world

1001
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,463
A One World Government

1002
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,559
The only way to 100% real

1003
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
Is for everyone in the world to be armed

1004
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
But let's imagine the inverse

1005
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,007
What is the prevailing attitude among politicians that Alex didn't like was that everyone should have

1006
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
Pretty easy to see how Alex

1007
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,383
Form of support of gun rights

1008
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,735
Conspiracy get everyone armed to the population killed each other off or triggers Mass python

1009
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
If the global supported gun rights

1010
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Then the only way to try and

1011
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Birthday Richie

1012
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,415
To be in favor of the cronian gun restrictions

1013
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,975
So you don't make their evil plans come

1014
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,303
Well I mean you don't want Auntie's are getting guns

1015
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,887
The 100% real group that is going to attack

1016
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,447
Can kill all Republicans if they have done so

1017
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,263
You have to be for some measure of gun-control there right

1018
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,311
But I think so yeah

1019
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,127
You picked it if you really wanted to get down to it

1020
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,735
Almost every bit of Alex's beliefs system runs

1021
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,783
At least through this felt

1022
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,063
It's very f*****

1023
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,647
When you are basic principles on doing the opposite of what

1024
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,927
You think your enemy is doing

1025
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,231
Nothing you believe in really means anything

1026
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,791
And I might my point is that nothing Alex

1027
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Believe me.

1028
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,679
Even his religious convictions could be seen as him trying to do the opposite of what he imagines

1029
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Does enemies want bike

1030
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
He pretends that he's fighting literal demons wanted to

1031
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,567
Destroy Christianity

1032
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
That was basically just

1033
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
Being a cartoonish version of a religious person that he presents himself to be on air

1034
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
Like almost everything could just be

1035
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:12,159
Yeah it could just be he has a massive dose of oppositional Defiance disorder that is

1036
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
Combined with is nice

1037
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,255
Statistic of tendency

1038
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Cease to create a

1039
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Human devoid of originality

1040
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
It's the oppositional defiance

1041
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
It's targeted specifically at imaginary position that he's ascribed to his imaginary

1042
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
It's B

1043
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,711
Kind of interesting

1044
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:42,111
It's a little bit like he's created a black hole of Personality that just absorbs whatever comes near him

1045
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:46,207
It also seems like a really efficient way to torture yourself

1046
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
Yeah

1047
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:52,607
Go to some calls calls with Paul

1048
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Paul calls

1049
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
Hi Alex

1050
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,031
Thank you

1051
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,567
In Lima

1052
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
We're talkin about

1053
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Italian dialect

1054
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,247
It's interesting it says that I

1055
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,551
Wisconsin from the steam

1056
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Karl Marx

1057
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
Caught the Revolutionary fever

1058
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
Drew heavily

1059
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Materialism

1060
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Depict

1061
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,023
Where the other

1062
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
Scorpio

1063
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Only inter

1064
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
The world

1065
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,519
The point however is

1066
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
2

1067
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
Change the world

1068
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Andymark

1069
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
Interpretation of reality

1070
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Universe

1071
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
You left by

1072
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,111
Religion and materialism

1073
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
The banker

1074
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:04,031
Okay caller is reading from a blog post from 2000 by a person identifying themselves as they say

1075
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
Diego police detective name

1076
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Philip award

1077
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:13,247
It is possible this is a real tribution cuz I can find multiple news articles about cases involving a detective in San Diego by

1078
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
That name

1079
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,343
That's the case this isn't an article that you should be citing

1080
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Make any actual points

1081
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:22,207
I found the blog post and it's actually a screed against

1082
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Community policing

1083
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
And how that's just a Marxist conspiracy

1084
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:32,191
If you read through it it seems like a really significant problem that this police detective has is the people are raising questions

1085
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,495
About whether or not the motive policing that's

1086
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,031
Become the norm in America

1087
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,823
What's a sufficiently sensitive

1088
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
Concerns of diverse communities

1089
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
But they're supposed to be police

1090
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
Accident by the way not bad

1091
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:55,231
Is really pissed off at the concerns of white Christian man aren't the only factor that matters

1092
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,583
And that means that we must have uncovered a communist plot

1093
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
I mean if

1094
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
If a detective walking a San Diego beach

1095
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
Doesn't Discover a communist

1096
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
But I'm shocked cuz that is

1097
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,127
Communism City over there I've been to San Diego

1098
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
I've walked

1099
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Communism everywhere

1100
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
San Diego Chargers

1101
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,247
Chargers

1102
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Charging

1103
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Credit card credit cards

1104
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:25,695
Centralization of bunnies trying to get rid of musical dollar play Electronic

1105
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,999
Were there

1106
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
So

1107
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:33,631
Apparently I don't know if there's a lot of things that you could probably say our

1108
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,423
Are communists in nature

1109
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,983
This is a little bit of a swing

1110
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
I mean even talk him out

1111
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
Which is again

1112
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Call me

1113
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,183
Do you have fireworks bands are coming

1114
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Communist

1115
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,767
I would like a f****** list

1116
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,631
For them everything everything except to sit down and give me what isn't communist

1117
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,703
Is communist

1118
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
According to a diamond I can't tell you what

1119
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,615
Honestly I'm struggling but according to this interview one of the things that is

1120
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,455
Is acceptance of homosexuality

1121
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,271
Decline of society

1122
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,343
Can go to the

1123
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
I'm fine

1124
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
Incident

1125
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
National Record

1126
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
Spider-Man

1127
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
Number 20

1128
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
The degenerate

1129
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
Norma

1130
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
Natural

1131
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
Permanent

1132
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:57,855
So this is being presented as if it's something that has any credibility but in reality if you do find out where this list of 45

1133
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,415
Indominus goals was right into the Congressional Record

1134
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,719
You'll find that it was representative of Herlong for

1135
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,255
From Florida and the comments

1136
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
Introduced this way

1137
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
Mr. speaker mrs. Patricia Nordman of DeLand Florida is an inarticulate

1138
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:16,031
Communism and until recently published the deal and Courier

1139
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,383
Which she dedicated to the purpose of alerting the public of the dangers of Communism in America

1140
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
Miss nordmann's request

1141
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,015
I include into the record under unanimous consent the following

1142
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
Current Communist goals

1143
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
Which she identified as an excerpt from the naked communist

1144
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,647
By Cleon skousen

1145
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
It's 1863

1146
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
Florida Center representative

1147
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
Thousands bulshit

1148
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Any Reddit

1149
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,607
The Congressional Record tonight were expected to take it seriously

1150
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,399
Gotta I'm not going to play that game

1151
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,239
So along with the the rent homophobia Paul is

1152
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,519
Is expressing in this list

1153
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,567
There are some weird things

1154
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,127
Vetta existence curious

1155
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Number 18 is

1156
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,479
Control of all student newspaper

1157
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Which seems like a dog

1158
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
No you got

1159
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:04,671
Is my campus paper in college and I do take that publication seriously and didn't get the time

1160
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Game

1161
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:11,839
We must occupy the student newspapers of all the colleges across this line

1162
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:18,239
It seems like a waste of company this time discredit and eventually

1163
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
Dismantle the FBI witch

1164
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
Seems like something Alex is very interested in

1165
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:27,711
It's pretty cool you know finding a place where Alex in the commies can find common cause

1166
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Discredit

1167
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,063
It seems like you've already got your work done for you so just

1168
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,087
Take them down

1169
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,903
Number 42 is particularly relevant to today

1170
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,535
Quotes create the impression that violence and Insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition

1171
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:47,423
Alex loves talked about watering the tree of Liberty with the blood of tyrants and he's been pretty clear that

1172
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,263
Yeah even though January 6th was a false flag even if it wasn't it would be

1173
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,311
Find because the people were there and they there right

1174
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,871
To do an Insurrection of the election result

1175
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,199
How to sounding more and more like a comet

1176
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:05,343
Call me I'm telling you anyway this is a faecalis written by an 80, Dash it had those red to the Congressional Record

1177
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,695
Meaningless accepted it allows Paul and Alex to lend credibility to their home phobic

1178
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
The conspiracy nonsense

1179
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Yeah

1180
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,791
Yeah that list is real bad

1181
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:16,863
It has the same problem of those those those

1182
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,679
Books that are like 101 ways to

1183
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,239
Surprise your partner with but you know

1184
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,519
Everyday dude

1185
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,103
And then they run out of ideas where they like take a bath and you like

1186
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Anybody

1187
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,407
Takes a bath man

1188
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
The idea that there is

1189
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,551
Try and convince Americans that Insurrection did violence at 5

1190
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,087
Ifucking birthday

1191
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,647
Every July 4th we're like

1192
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Hey

1193
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:45,023
It's illegal to have fireworks but guess what the Austin Police do give a f*** I've got a cannon

1194
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,559
That's the game

1195
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
No we got this

1196
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
Paul believes that acceptance of homosexuality is a communist conspiracy

1197
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,311
How is we're up to so much more that can

1198
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,103
Conveniently

1199
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
15 with

1200
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:05,503
But making Paul's bigotry not looks

1201
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
It was the

1202
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
Financial backer behind

1203
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,383
So the CIA did have involvement with Steinem but Alex Apollo really over-reaching here

1204
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
Gloria Steinem was involved in the CIA as part of her efforts to recruit left-leaning youths to go to a Vienna conference being held by cam

1205
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
Communist

1206
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,087
Effectively debate

1207
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,879
The Communists about the virtues of America

1208
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:49,023
She did this as the head of the independent research service and CIA funded outfit at Harvard

1209
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,071
Steinem wrote about this

1210
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,119
Experience in her book my life on the road

1211
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:59,775
Alex honestly should totally support her work with the CIA since the goal of it was to disrupt events like this Vienna conference

1212
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,335
There were seen as being communist propaganda

1213
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:07,711
Yeah it was supposed to discredit and then eventually dismantle the Vienna conference

1214
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:13,087
This magazine wasn't founded until 1972 which was a bit later than this and the magazine self was

1215
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Funded by the CIA

1216
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,231
This magazine is not the initiator nor the most important aspect of Fem

1217
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:23,071
But it was political magazine that was directed towards

1218
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,399
Women and interest

1219
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Important

1220
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:34,079
History as we all know feminism began somewhere in the 772

1221
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:40,479
View the Paul and Alex are assessed facts and report information accurately

1222
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
They're invested in attacking and discrediting Simoniz

1223
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,575
So every supposed fact

1224
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,391
Needs to work in service of that predetermined endpoint

1225
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
That they're engaged

1226
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
That that's the Elder doing

1227
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
It's really stupid

1228
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
The most

1229
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Kind of like

1230
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
Soft

1231
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:59,167
Misogyny there is just that idea always

1232
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Well there's no way they could

1233
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,263
Could come to the independent conclusion that they're being so

1234
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:08,383
F***** over by a financier who's tricking them

1235
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,015
Essentially what we have here when you're blaming the CIA and Tommy's

1236
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,551
4

1237
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:20,415
Essentially the acceptance of homosexuality and feminism existing

1238
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
What are you doing is saying that without these nefarious actors

1239
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:30,399
Straight white man would rule everything and everyone would have

1240
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:36,799
Accepted as an obvious evidence that straight white men should rule the world

1241
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,615
Commies and commies work in the CIA

1242
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,175
Scott it sucks ridiculous

1243
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:48,319
You get down to it everyday I wake up and I look at the stars and I'm like obviously white male

1244
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
I don't want to be

1245
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,415
Women

1246
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,439
Can work

1247
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:56,767
If they want to welcome crazy

1248
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:00,607
This is the 42nd clip-in Alex is a little unclear actually

1249
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
What

1250
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,951
But the CIA

1251
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,871
Working is also a plot of the

1252
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,175
The CIA

1253
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
Should they so choose

1254
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
They wouldn't

1255
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,391
If it weren't for the Communist like

1256
01:11:55,647 --> 01:12:00,767
Women's Natural Instincts would override the the government's desire to make them work

1257
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,703
For the commies in the CIA

1258
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,239
You know

1259
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
It seemed so and episodes

1260
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,871
I'm going to I'm going to just throw this out there at

1261
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
It seems like

1262
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
Tumi

1263
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
That the commies

1264
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,855
That are most often reference by the anti-communist

1265
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,183
Have nothing to do with straight white men

1266
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,559
Despite the fact that at the time of Russia when they anti-communist were supposed to be fighting

1267
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
Austria Whiteman

1268
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
In Russia ultra-wide

1269
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,239
So their enemy was all straight white men

1270
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,799
But the Communists the enemy

1271
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
Wright was the one who's trying to

1272
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,663
Real white male hegemony

1273
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Right I think

1274
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,759
That Alex could actually thread that meat

1275
01:12:54,015 --> 01:13:00,159
I don't think you have a problem with your rebuttal I really don't because

1276
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,719
Based on his chauvinistic worldview

1277
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,791
Right he would say that yes there is a straight

1278
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,071
White male hegemony

1279
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
In Russia

1280
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,655
They're trying to undermine that heater

1281
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,727
Because they know that will weaken America

1282
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:17,823
Straight white male hegemony is inevitable it's just a matter of

1283
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:23,455
Whether the commies or the capitalists are running the straight white male Hood pajamas because it's

1284
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
It's being undermined as Anna

1285
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Attack right

1286
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,927
And then the Russian straight white male hegemony will take over here

1287
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
So almost

1288
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Ironically

1289
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:41,119
They are admitting that all of the minorities of America are the

1290
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,959
The deciding factor in whether or not coming is America capitalism will win

1291
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:50,847
That is interesting I haven't unpacked that but yet Perhaps

1292
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:54,943
Alex talked about this whole Defiance politics

1293
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:59,551
I told you to get back to it as a related to the Vietnam War at this is so stupid

1294
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
In awhile here doing

1295
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,311
No Stan

1296
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
Conservative talk show hosts

1297
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
Oh

1298
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,087
I forgot you guys still hated Michael Savage at this point Luther King Junior

1299
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,183
If the CIA in the Communist had not hired a bunch of black people

1300
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,999
To go wreck everything in white neighborhood

1301
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:44,607
It would totally would have happened conservatives what a f****** loved Martin Luther King jr.

1302
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:48,191
If it weren't for the pocket, I just think that

1303
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,239
What Alex is describing is

1304
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,895
Conservice being really dumb and I honestly don't think they were even as dumb as Alex's presenting them to be

1305
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
Notion that like your support or opposition of a

1306
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
F******

1307
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Would be dependent

1308
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
The behavior of beatniks beatniks were more polite I would have been against the Vietnam War you would have to be

1309
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,767
So

1310
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,791
Detached

1311
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:17,375
From the actual issue that you're supporting or opposing

1312
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,191
But you would have to have no feeling about the war

1313
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Itself right you have to have no principal show conviction

1314
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:31,455
People who oppose it

1315
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,807
Horrible if a beatnik comes to your like bar

1316
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:42,207
Okay and then you've got a little bowl of nuts in your drinking your beer in the beatnik knocks the nuts

1317
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
Do you think to yourself what obviously

1318
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,607
We should burn down villages in Vietnam

1319
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Conclusion to come to

1320
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,751
But it's

1321
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
One of the few things that I think

1322
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:58,591
I agree on it that's the

1323
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,127
Cops and civilized

1324
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Right

1325
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,175
I hate Alex

1326
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
I think you sucks

1327
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
I think it's one of the worst

1328
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
But

1329
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:09,599
I see him opposing civil asset forfeiture and my instinct isn't to be like

1330
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:13,439
I must be for you've got to be for the cops stealing things

1331
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:19,071
But that's how Alex's brain work it is so dumb if he finds out that you're against cops

1332
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:25,471
Stealing things I think he might be I actually haven't heard him talk about it in a while you might have gotten there on his own

1333
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:29,823
For that matter

1334
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,871
Do they mention Michael Savage

1335
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
Beatnik past there

1336
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
An hour

1337
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
I didn't realize this but

1338
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,623
Michael Savage's show on NBC or MSNBC actually got cancelled in 2003

1339
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,159
The Alex discusses that

1340
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Pier

1341
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
No Stan

1342
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
Conservative talk show hosts

1343
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,071
Michael Savage

1344
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,263
Coronavirus

1345
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:15,647
So I just real quick want to play for you what Michael Savage got fired for

1346
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:19,999
Definition by Blackstar it is not

1347
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,351
This is Michael Savage let's go to story

1348
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,887
Give me a ring right here on the Sabbath

1349
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Oxidation go ahead please

1350
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Did you have a worst

1351
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
The next one

1352
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
Hey Michael Savage

1353
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,311
I was flying to Laguardia

1354
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,335
Yeah

1355
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
There's two Undercover

1356
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:36,895
Security guards

1357
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Yeah

1358
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
Somebody was smoking in about

1359
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,991
Someone was smoking in the bathroom

1360
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
What happened

1361
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Affirmative flight

1362
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
I need to suggest

1363
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Dynamite Takis

1364
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,487
Alright alright

1365
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,839
Yes I am I only get AIDS and die

1366
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
How's that

1367
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
Want to see if you can still meet you

1368
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
You got nothing better

1369
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,495
Put me down your piece of garbage

1370
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,311
You got nothing to do today go eat a sausage and choke on it

1371
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Trichinosis

1372
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,383
Okay let me know the night

1373
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:12,223
Call Gyros busy because you have a nice night in the bathhouses angry at me today

1374
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,039
Get me another one put it on the side of my tan

1375
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,879
No more calls I don't care let's go to the next scene I don't care about the

1376
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
Nothing

1377
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
So he got kicked out for what

1378
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:30,911
Yeah that was a particularly distasteful presentation that's a game

1379
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,471
I don't know if Alex understand the First Amendment

1380
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,031
Government had done something and respond

1381
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Monster him

1382
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:41,151
Being horribly homophobic abusive to this person on air

1383
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,711
Then I think you might have some kind of the first

1384
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,479
Discussion plate

1385
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,271
He did something

1386
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,575
I don't know live show that was

1387
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
Credibly

1388
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
Awful

1389
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
And again

1390
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:56,511
The standards of the station that they fired him for about a First Amendment issue

1391
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,071
Alex just

1392
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,607
Do you want I guess

1393
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,679
I mean I got fired for asking for a raise

1394
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:10,079
So that's different that's different

1395
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:16,479
Not sure how but it's different

1396
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,807
I find it really fascinating to go back

1397
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
These points

1398
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,111
Deep in the past

1399
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
And receive this

1400
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
Completely

1401
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,231
Infantile

1402
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
Understanding

1403
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,071
Someone is supposed to be a Bedrock issue

1404
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
Super m

1405
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
Yeah it's

1406
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,911
Not surprising

1407
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
I mean

1408
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Kind of a bummer

1409
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,007
If it is

1410
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,567
If it was that all something that you value

1411
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,615
It would be different

1412
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
I think

1413
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,663
What he

1414
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
Values

1415
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
News about it

1416
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:52,319
Is actually that it's been applied in such a way to his life

1417
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,135
That he can get away with saying anything

1418
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,719
Evaluate

1419
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,279
That you're getting to something but it's the value isn't

1420
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,327
The actual first

1421
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,143
That would be a principal that he wants to

1422
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
The credibility of reporting

1423
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,055
The principle that he actually has his I don't want consequences for saying horrible

1424
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,384
I don't want people to actually accurately judge

1425
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,712
What I put out into the world to answer for it

1426
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,784
Michael Savage shouldn't have to answer for

1427
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,832
Horrible things you shouldn't have

1428
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
Somebody fire him

1429
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Forward this

1430
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:31,232
Think they obviously wouldn't want to be associated with First Amendment

1431
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:36,096
Boils really hard down to just like I don't want to feel bad for the things that I say

1432
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:42,752
And I should be allowed access to every platform or I'll drive My First Amendment right

1433
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,288
That's nonsense

1434
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,592
That's not good so it's a little plug

1435
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616
One of his films

1436
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:52,992
I thought this was just actually really funny Alex has a master of raising the stakes

1437
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,744
Hours and 41 minutes

1438
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,632
I love that it's 2 hours and 40 minutes

1439
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:13,216
Frankly it's 2 hours and 41

1440
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,008
It's 241

1441
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:20,128
I'm a truth that tip of the f****** spear here man I'm not going to lie to my audience

1442
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
And say it's 2:40

1443
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,224
What is actually 241

1444
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,600
Actually I'm going to call it 181 point three minutes that's what we need to call

1445
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,392
So Alex takes more calls

1446
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,672
Smart Paul calls

1447
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,256
Just got worried

1448
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,608
North Carolina

1449
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
Chihuahua friends

1450
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
Australia no

1451
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,776
Do you know all the rest of the country

1452
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,128
All I can say is

1453
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,664
Do people

1454
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,712
Trying to tell people

1455
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
No

1456
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
What is going on

1457
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,832
What is going on

1458
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,136
Colon complete

1459
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Play the music

1460
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
Pinole

1461
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
SanMar

1462
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Germany

1463
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Maryland

1464
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
England

1465
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,496
Wales

1466
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,336
You know what's going on

1467
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Really

1468
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:36,160
You might be onto something here

1469
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,488
You're naming a lot of countries with something in common

1470
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,048
I don't know where you're going with this

1471
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,352
I think

1472
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
I've listened to a lot of

1473
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
Alex Jones

1474
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,984
I've missed you a lot of calls

1475
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,032
And I am

1476
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,312
Flabbergasted

1477
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,664
You did not interrupt him what that guy is

1478
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,968
Verbal pattern is very slow

1479
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
Bien during interrupt

1480
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:07,136
Yeah out of Ireland that seems like a choice

1481
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,184
Nissan Alex's Bart not to interrupt him

1482
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,768
Yeah the only thing that I can see in there that'll be like

1483
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
Why why wouldn't you interrupt

1484
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,376
Which was

1485
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Not a

1486
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Thing

1487
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Add 2000

1488
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,472
Not anymore

1489
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,288
Yeah they renamed it wyaconda

1490
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,312
It's a signal

1491
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:29,152
2 white supremacist American nationalist

1492
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:33,248
Do you not interrupting him when he's not saying anything and rambling

1493
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
Is it bad

1494
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,368
Hey he said Rhodesia so he's probably got something I want to listen

1495
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,416
He doesn't actually end up

1496
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,304
Saying really anything yeah that's not surprising you just wanted to say how great white people are

1497
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,656
I'm sorry I get another caller and unfortunately this doesn't lead to a crack

1498
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,680
Movie review

1499
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:04,480
Illuminati New World Order

1500
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
Is it

1501
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,840
Also there are

1502
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,192
Tearing something right now

1503
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,216
Special effects

1504
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
You still frame it

1505
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
Frame by frame

1506
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,552
I'm a knight

1507
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
Don't

1508
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
First of all

1509
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
What

1510
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,928
Yes the world does

1511
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
Band together to fight off the air

1512
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,256
Illuminati Style

1513
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:52,864
I don't know cuz under the United States

1514
01:24:54,656 --> 01:25:00,032
Our weigh-in is still everybody who contributes to actually defeating the alien right

1515
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,568
Are American

1516
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
Jeff Goldblum

1517
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,944
Will Smith but here's the

1518
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:14,880
What you're not understanding here though is that this guy has been proven right

1519
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
Okay

1520
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
How

1521
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,720
Is it possible

1522
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,280
For neither Will Smith

1523
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,352
Nor Jeff Goldblum to become any less attractive

1524
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
This many years later

1525
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:30,752
In fact I might argue that Goldblum has only become more attractive and it's silver foxeer

1526
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288
You know who's real sexy though

1527
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
Hirsch

1528
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,200
I don't know I think

1529
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,736
I think

1530
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,064
I mean what you got Robert Lozier in your movie it's clearly Illuminati

1531
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
What

1532
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:50,976
This is a dumb question I lose track of culture really quick leadership

1533
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,280
They make a sequel to Independence

1534
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:57,632
30 years later

1535
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
Couldn't tell if I had

1536
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,728
Imagine that Will Smith wasn't in it

1537
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,288
I think that's why you don't think it's a sequel to Independence Day

1538
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:08,640
Hearing about it and then not seeing it and then I don't know

1539
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,432
How do I get to conversation about

1540
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:17,600
To them talking about how the globalists are going to fake an alien invasion Shoreline order to bring us all together and create a world cover

1541
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,648
But here is a Paul with a

1542
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
The hot prediction

1543
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Down the line

1544
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,336
Well obviously

1545
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:42,176
Predictions that enforces got incorrect

1546
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,480
I always write alien invasion

1547
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:50,880
Fifteen52 2018 totally

1548
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,952
Interview with Katherine Albright

1549
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
It's

1550
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
I don't care

1551
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,560
They don't talk about any of this

1552
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,888
Specifics of the documents that she supposedly hacked

1553
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
Somehow

1554
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
Or not I don't know what you just described it as like to use the Google search like a Boolean search bar on the website

1555
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,360
Titan that you found some documents on the site

1556
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,664
Autocorrecting is love

1557
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
Describe

1558
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
For Alex

1559
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,040
He says that she was using like

1560
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:24,416
Login information like brute-force hacking earlier and then she's like

1561
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,184
Ida search

1562
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
But thanks I don't know

1563
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Are they don't

1564
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,352
Direct you to any actual primary sources I don't care

1565
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,656
If I use DuckDuckGo

1566
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,704
Dove

1567
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
Grocery store card

1568
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,288
So I am

1569
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
They're scared

1570
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
It's a snooze

1571
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,920
Alex introduces her this way and I just thought this was

1572
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Outrageous

1573
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
Communicate

1574
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,872
Lottery

1575
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,480
Microscopic

1576
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:29,440
Cell phone since then but consistently on iPhone

1577
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,232
It's this is Soca nonsense

1578
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:35,328
Yeah like you're trying to make everyone afraid of these RFID things

1579
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,680
Presumably for the multiple reasons of tracking and

1580
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:45,312
Whatever pulse could be given off by it and you're admitting here that phones are more dangerous

1581
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,336
And you have phones

1582
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,872
It was a stupid

1583
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
You know

1584
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,456
Like listening back to these

1585
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,296
Free SmartPhone era there is like that

1586
01:28:55,552 --> 01:29:01,696
That same thing you see in movies where they have to contrive a reason why you can't find your smartphone in a horror movie cuz otherwise the

1587
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:06,304
Story would be like lot is over

1588
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,864
What is so many conspiracy theories

1589
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
Is even now have to like

1590
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:17,056
Find a way to avoid talking about the fact that your phone does 99% of everything they've ever been afraid of

1591
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,872
Since the dawn of conspiracy theories

1592
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
How how is it

1593
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,736
My phone tells me how many f****** steps

1594
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,552
I've taken surely the government doesn't know where I'm

1595
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,648
They literally do anything with your phone

1596
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:34,720
Yeah yeah man it's it is true that like

1597
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,000
Essentially

1598
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:41,632
Give him all of the conspiracy threads that existed prior to smartphones

1599
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:48,032
All of them should have just woven together into a grande contemporary that is this

1600
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:53,152
Society collapses we fought a war over the fact that a smartphone

1601
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:57,248
And then they should have had parties where they'd smash

1602
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:02,112
Cell phone become some kind of

1603
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,136
Like

1604
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,952
People live in the woods

1605
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,536
And I remember vaguely the movie Enemy of the State

1606
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,096
And I'm like as I remember it I'm like

1607
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
It was such a

1608
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,192
Huge Revelation in those moments for them to be like

1609
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:19,776
The government's doing this and now my god dude I can do that

1610
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,824
I can watch my pet from

1611
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
F****** space

1612
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Yeah it's fine

1613
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,456
The fight it's probably Superbad

1614
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:32,576
Whatever watch your pets from space you can't get to space

1615
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,856
Estate sales

1616
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,648
So quiet now

1617
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,184
Yeah what are we going to do

1618
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,048
2003's

1619
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,864
Lower Stakes time

1620
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,192
But I think you still get

1621
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:48,960
What's up

1622
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,520
It was stration

1623
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,080
Of these things are actually still very relevant

1624
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:00,992
This politics with based and essentially imagining what your enemy believes and then doing the opposite

1625
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
It's soaking

1626
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,296
Consistent throughout Alex's life

1627
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
And

1628
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,344
The use of

1629
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,136
These imaginary enemies

1630
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,952
In order to reinforce the bigotries that you want

1631
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,720
2

1632
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,256
Carryout

1633
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:17,888
You know CIA and the commies want you to accept homosexuality and they're behind

1634
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,424
It's all just

1635
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,520
In service of intellectualizing your own bigotries

1636
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,592
In order to make it not seem so bad that your plan

1637
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,408
Yeah that's all they're doing I mean the thing that I

1638
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,456
Immediately like

1639
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
Reevaluate

1640
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:37,088
Is those those that first week of covid-19 in about how

1641
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,136
If we know it's over for Humanity

1642
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:43,744
You got these numbers out of China I probably 100 times as many dead and then

1643
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,840
Quick turn to like this all fake this is nothing and it's like

1644
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,448
UCSF my immediate Instinct at the time was all he's got the March

1645
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:58,848
King orders he's got the the line from all these people and now the more I think about it the more it's like maybe he just saw that people on the left

1646
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,616
We're taking it

1647
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Seriously

1648
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,224
You know and he's like well if they're taking it seriously it's got to be a conspiracy

1649
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
Yeah you know like that's

1650
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,296
Sad

1651
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,064
It's sad

1652
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:14,464
Imagine that

1653
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,096
Analyzing Public Health

1654
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,704
And then he realized what they were like actually this could be bad

1655
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,032
I think I think there's a lot to that

1656
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,336
Stream miss that he's gone down the road

1657
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,872
I know that road

1658
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,920
In particular does track with people

1659
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,760
Continuing to take some more we take it seriously the more nuts he goes

1660
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:42,624
Yeah I just wanted to cover this episode 4 was the

1661
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,952
Bizarre conversation about free speech

1662
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,256
Involved with him going

1663
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,816
Call indoor radio show

1664
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,864
Yeah I thought that was that

1665
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:58,496
Was really fun just to imagine Alex sitting there trying to do a fake voice calling into a show

1666
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:03,104
I'm not letting about the show and then him immediately calling everyone he knows how

1667
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,920
You got a call into the show they won't let me on any baby

1668
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
So far

1669
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,736
Terrible Texan accent he lives

1670
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
So we'll be back

1671
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:16,672
Probably with a present episode going on

1672
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,208
Alex is quit again

1673
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:24,352
I don't know maybe he's going back to the capital today and

1674
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,632
Taken care of

1675
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,448
I would love it if we check back in on the present

1676
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,544
When do radio shows

1677
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,944
I hope you the best so good

1678
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:45,344
Jordans

1679
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
The sex robot

1680
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:02,496
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
