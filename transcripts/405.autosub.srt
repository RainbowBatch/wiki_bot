1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need need money

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody sit around

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
Joan

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan

8
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
Quick question what up

9
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Have you ever been

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
To an art

11
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Yeah

12
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Uber to sue most people have been to art galleries

13
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
I mean like which one with you your girlfriend's an artist

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
But I'm trying to think of like a museum of art gallery

15
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
Family in California

16
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
Specifically I wouldn't be surprised at all if I've been to be literal Getty

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Open to the

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,336
Aquarium that sort of the museum the fish

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
No I don't like art at all

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
Dominus Rembrandt b******* I respect

21
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,112
I appreciate those who appreciate it but I also don't

22
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,952
You don't understand no visual art.

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
I can I can look at it they got school

24
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Woodside is about the death of my understanding of it

25
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Like I'm intrigued me like to look at

26
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,496
But I don't understand why

27
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,872
I've tried to have people explain things to me about Aesthetics

28
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Wheatley

29
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
For intimate like

30
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Speaking another language

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
I have no idea my brother has a lot of that he's very into art

32
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
And very

33
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
Very talented with

34
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
Creating the Heartland drawing in InDesign

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
And and also really

36
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Enjoys

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Itself and I just have none of it

38
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
That's fascinating why do you think I don't know

39
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
Okay

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't know

41
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,336
I don't I honestly I thought about it over the course of my life and like

42
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
I never was

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
2 in

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Into art

45
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Younger person

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
I tried to like take

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Little courses on it here and there

48
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
What's going on

49
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Nothing

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Right over the head

51
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Crazy why

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Why do you remind me somebody told me that I don't really like music

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:21,472
Just boggles my mind whenever like there's so many cool s***

54
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,336
Just let him be I don't understand world I don't understand

55
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Go back and forth on it

56
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
Music

57
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,112
I enjoy it in in periods of my life but I also really like the spoken word like audiobooks

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
You know it's it's there's some people who just

59
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,328
Need music all the time and it's in their bones and stuff everywhere

60
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
At it like you why so you know for me I'm sort of in the middle and I assume there's some people even

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:59,104
Further to like I don't even I don't I don't know it's just a bunch of beeps and boops

62
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,432
As always have on the extreme

63
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Just about every

64
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
I don't know too much about art but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

65
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
4:15

66
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,303

88
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
But you are now a technocrat

89
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Business

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Heroin

91
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
So good

92
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
Freakishly large

93
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
Lakers about to Nathan m

94
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583

Hydro this yard likes these dance do you do that back onto our website knowledge buy.com clicking the button

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Sure we would appreciate

98
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
So Jordan here's the situation that I find myself

99
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:20,927
So for our second episode this week I felt the desire to get back in and discuss Alex has returned to the studio after his trip

100
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Courtesy pack

101
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
I knew you had some hot takes about the coronavirus apparently he's trying to lure Sebastian Gorka into a sad puppy

102
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Felicity stunt fight

103
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
And he's getting more and more comfortable these days bragging about literally murdering people reported around

104
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,103
That again cool.

105
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,943
I wish it was headlines would say again

106
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
You know everyone learns a new at the endpoint and that's great

107
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
As long as everybody getting there

108
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,927
If you get there you get there I was trying to brag a lot about murder

109
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,559
Monday's show was 4 hours long and full of emotional trouble it also just awful right-wing content

110
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
The prospect of this Friday episode being another long Dent Affair just didn't seem like it would be right in terms of being a steward

111
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Of our audiences well-being

112
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
I did not feel comfortable with that

113
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,199
I'm so what I've decided to do is cover this past week's content of Alex's show honor episode from Monday

114
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
So on Monday

115
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
We going over this past week

116
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
And the chaos that ensued on Alex's show

117
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,183
We can spend a little time doing something little more fun and fancy free

118
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,303
The tensions are high in the world with the growing Public Health situation the Democratic primary

119
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
And countless other real-world stressors

120
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,495
The team clear to me that if we're going to survive we need something is removed from real-world stressors as possible

121
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
And just our luck

122
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
At the end of last week

123
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
Kerry Cassidy over Project Camelot release date

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,575
With murderers flash spacegirl Mark Richards

125
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
But even if we weren't in this position where the tensions are really high we would still need to drop everything and cover this interface

126
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
Give everyone up to speed who haven't heard all of our old episodes about this

127
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,447
Margaret has been in prison since the 80s haven't been convicted of orchestrating the murder of an associate of his

128
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,311
It's very complicated to get into briefly but we've been over to Bundchen Mark totally did that s***

129
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Mark was also a little bit of a cult leader

130
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Antietam list

131
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,783
Young man in his work crew to be nights of his new Camelot which would come into its ultimate form when they use the laser

132
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
The isolate Marin County from the rest of the United

133
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Estates at which point it would be gone marks Kingdom

134
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
They were

135
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
Surprisingly close to making that area I don't know if they work

136
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,327
Since going to prison Marquez married a woman named Joanne who runs

137
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
When's the Earth Defense headquarters

138
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,983
I'm unclear on exactly what they do other than sell marks writing and books

139
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
That the entente book Joann

140
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Speakers face weirdo confer

141
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Through Jo-Ann Marcus created an overly elaborate backstory aimed at building an absurdly heroic meet those for

142
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,367
Grubsouth as well as proving that he's innocent of the crime he's in jail for definitely committed

143
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,719
As it turns out you couldn't have been involved in the murder because he was off-planet doing space

144
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Space mission at the time case closed due to the

145
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
It does sound like he he couldn't have done

146
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,655
At some point Joanne met Kerry Cassidy

147
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
Who runs a YouTube channel where people lie to her about Space Adventures

148
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
Kerry interview Joanne about Mark's heroics and through this Carrie ended up being welcome to interview Mark in prison

149
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
Vacaville in person

150
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
From there the rest

151
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Is history

152
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,135
Gary's interviewed Mark 12 times now in the stories he tells her range from standard conspiracy should to most

153
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
The most outrageously fun nonsense

154
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
I've ever heard

155
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
His sentient spacecraft Minerva has a delightful personality of it but will not fly with anyone but Mark because

156
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
Loyalty

157
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,543
Speaking of loyalties the noble Raptor aliens are viciously loyal to Mark personally to the point where he once had an affair

158
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
They're with their princess the Raptor princess

159
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,967
The new JFK as a child you've met aliens ranging from the Mercantile dogs

160
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,039
Do the spider leadership to the archaeologists caps

161
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,183
Churchill too or no

162
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Sad story

163
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
I can't even remember half the dumb s*** you said they recovered on the show but most of it's really funny like how Raptor aliens were feet

164
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,823
Featured in Jurassic Park and The Walking with Dinosaurs show and that Raptors like to come to Earth to go antiquing

165
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
It's amazing.

166
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,943
Also there's a 50-50 chance he's aware of us

167
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Listeners have pointed out that in an early Mark Richards episode we joked about how if he's listening the way to subtly

168
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,207
Signal to us what to tell Carrie about squid or octopus alien

169
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
Which he did do in the 11th in a few

170
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,911
One of the more recent ones you did bring up octopus

171
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Conclusive to me though

172
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
There's a real good chance that octopus aliens were bound to show up

173
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
But some point but

174
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
It could also be a wink

175
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Not clear

176
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
So officially if you're listening mark

177
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Next time

178
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Tell Carrie that the octopus aliens are controlled by a benevolent AI

179
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
Expect an octopus to be evil

180
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
That seems random enough for me to be able to make a conclusive judgment that is absolutely

181
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
And

182
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,167
If we get the signal from you we will start feeding you messages

183
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
That we will not.

184
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Through him

185
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
That would ruin the purity of the turf as I've

186
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,247
Discuss them with me not calling Alex yes yes I Can't Get Enough

187
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Zoe

188
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,879
Carrie just went back to see Mark and now it's time to see what there is to learn

189
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Bravo about the real world

190
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
From this professor / murderer

191
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Let's see what

192
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
Here's the introduction that follows very standard course

193
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy

194
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Baby from Project Camelot a scary here today too

195
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Talk about

196
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
My latest interview with Captain Mark Richard

197
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Of the secret space

198
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Program

199
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Call Total Wreck

200
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
Call 12 space command

201
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
So she always called them Total Recall because he has to remember the interview and then repeat

202
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
What he said later cuz they don't let her record it right

203
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
In prison cuz he's a murderer

204
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
But I'd not heard any of these that have a subtitle

205
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Exclusively about space

206
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
That's what you would think

207
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Fair enough it is not fair enough

208
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
You might think

209
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
Like

210
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,127
I've seen shows where people interview

211
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
Murderers in prison

212
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
It does

213
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
It does seem like

214
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
Somebody is screwing with Carrie somewhere along the line I've never heard her explain exactly what the game she's play

215
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
Playing is but in this twelfth interviews explains how

216
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
She is allowed

217
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
To even talk to Monica

218
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
What I always do is go to Solano Prison

219
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
And I've been doing this

220
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Interview now for

221
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Around 5

222
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
And this is

223
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Again the 12

224
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Interview

225
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
I am accompanied by

226
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
His wife Joanne Richards who

227
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Facilitate

228
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
The interview

229
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
And be

230
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Because I am not

231
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Doing this

232
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
As an official journalist

233
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Because journalists are denied for

234
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
From interviewing

235
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
And Oprah tried

236
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Many years ago in

237
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,727
Deny data recording to what I do is go in as a friend

238
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
And I am not allowed to

239
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Recording devices

240
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Any kind

241
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
I end up getting a

242
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
A tiny

243
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Pencil and

244
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
And I'm able

245
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
To use that

246
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
To do the interview

247
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,111
You so other

248
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
I believe other installments

249
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
So what she's doing is she's defrosting the prison

250
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
She is coming in there as a friend

251
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Taking interview notes

252
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
And telling them she's not a journalist

253
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,775
Cuz if she wasn't journalist you would be banned from entering the door not be allowed to speak to Mark probably

254
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
There's some sort of a rule

255
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
I'm not sure what it is I have no idea how I would get to the bottom of this or if I even believe it doesn't really good at all just

256
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,087
Interview Mark I don't believe that for a second

257
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Maybe

258
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,439
I mean she talks to people like dr. Oz

259
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Special Jersey interviewed mark

260
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
That is not going to help you build that lady

261
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,359
That's conceivably possible at some point Oprah might have been wanting to do some kind of a story

262
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
On him being a burger

263
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
I don't know

264
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,063
It seems unlikely that you'd want to interview him the same way They Carried

265
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
That does not seem like

266
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Jack cool I hope that doesn't get back to the guards at Salado

267
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
And her saying that on her show doesn't end up resulting in her being barred from visiting Mark

268
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
Tragic irony

269
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
I don't believe her for a sec

270
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
I don't believe it either

271
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
So there's some stuff going on

272
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Solano Prison in Vacaville

273
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Affected marks mood

274
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
At the time of this interview

275
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
Basically that prison had been on lockdown

276
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
For the two-week

277
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Prior

278
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Because of

279
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
The Killing in the

280
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
And

281
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Mark was quite

282
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Tired

283
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
This time when I interviewed him

284
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Apparently

285
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
All the things going on

286
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Quite

287
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Draining

288
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Over those few weeks

289
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
And

290
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
So that's the kind of thing that does go on

291
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Possible he

292
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
He was also under attack

293
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Did not reveal

294
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Nothing about that

295
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
I'm going to leave that last part alone and just say she's not making that up on January

296
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Nights 2020

297
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Dances 2020

298
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
Two inmates were murdered at Cal State Prison Solano where Marcus

299
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Incarcerated

300
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
The two attacks were separate but all indications are that they were related

301
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
3:20 p.m. to inmates attack alone guy in the general population yard and then less than a minute later on

302
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Another Duo attacked another man

303
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Laying in the yard

304
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,151
At this point I can't find any reporting on an official explanation for the motive but it's pretty messed up turn of events

305
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:22,783
Violence to the prison is not that uncommon but this sort of thing like a pair of coordinated killings

306
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
I don't think that happens everyday

307
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
I could see this making Market B Tire

308
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
Since we probably

309
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
A bit of increased security protocol and whatnot and you know what I don't care for much remark and I like to laugh at his

310
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
Is dumb stories

311
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,727
But you know these this is Brianna examine piece of like what life it

312
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Is like four people going to G rated like

313
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,127
Mark had nothing to do with these killings as far as anybody can tell

314
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
Obviously I don't have any suspicions of that

315
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
Because of them happening they introduced all kinds of Life stressors to do his date

316
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Needed a life that like

317
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
That's awful

318
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
I can't imagine not getting some sort of PA

319
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's f***** up

320
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
I feel bad for him on a human level for that

321
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Joe keery

322
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Has a big

323
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Thing that she's into

324
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,799
On this episode

325
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Know how is that possible

326
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,735
Everything is space command

327
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Carrie is into this

328
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
This story

329
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,183
And I've heard her talk about it in a couple of the interviews that I've listened

330
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
Come to that we haven't covered like when she went talk to those magicians

331
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Airborne

332
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,399
So there is uk-based

333
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,983
UFO event called rendlesham

334
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
And she actually went to the UK and that's went to at least one of them

335
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
And so she's been

336
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Getting into the case

337
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Trying to get to the bottom of this

338
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,671
1980 UK UFO sighting

339
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
And it turns out

340
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
Might have been some trouble

341
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Okay because of that suits you might be able to

342
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Consequences

343
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
I had been in England

344
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
For the holidays

345
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
For returning on

346
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
On January 12th

347
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
That night

348
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Before

349
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
It was around 11:30 at night

350
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Nearly had a head-on with

351
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
A black ass

352
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Range Rover

353
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
That was in a two-lane road and

354
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Come over to our lane

355
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
84s

356
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Raptors

357
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Best to avoid it at

358
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
At the last minute

359
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
The driver did not seem to

360
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
I realize they were on our

361
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Our side of the road at

362
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Time

363
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
And

364
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Actually

365
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Hippy program

366
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,775
We got program to people driving SUVs trying to run Gary off the road

367
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
I just ate it

368
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
It's just like with me

369
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
We're not sure if

370
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Mark was under attack like everything is about you everything is about you

371
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
So many areas of

372
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,767
Even like this the stuff we cover like how many times was Rodger Stone under attack back in the

373
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
Early date before he was arrested or anything

374
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:22,751
Like when he there was the polonium poisoning Affair even like

375
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
If that's

376
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
Do you forget about the like multiple times Alex tried to save someone tried to run Rodger Othello

377
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,271
This is this is something that gets a lot of mileage

378
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
In these worlds

379
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
It's completely on verifiable super scary absolutely but if you believe it it means that you're doing something that's some

380
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Someone is afraid of

381
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,071
So if you can get someone to believe the premise you get them to buy the

382
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,935
Conclusion really easily to kill you you're not working hard enough

383
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Bright lights

384
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,031
The truth you know what you're working hard on something it's very scary

385
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Threatening

386
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Powers-that-be that is

387
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
Rendlesham I believe the

388
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
SUV was headed for us is

389
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Kind of a warning possibly because

390
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
Cuz of my sudden

391
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Interest

392
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
In revisiting the rental

393
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Forest

394
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Siding

395
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Landing

396
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
That went on for several days

397
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
And I did ask

398
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
About it in my interview

399
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Xochitl talked to him a little bit more about this later but the basic story of the rendlesham event

400
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,543
Is it was on December 26th 1980

401
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
And a security patrol saw some lights appear in the fall near rendlesham Forest

402
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
They went towards the lights and claimed that they saw glowing metallic object

403
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,831
An hour later police arrived they couldn't find any evidence of any of the things with

404
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,415
Patrolman claim they've seen nothing in terms of even like

405
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Down

406
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
Freezer

407
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,655
2 Days Later the tenant Colonel Charles Holt came to the site to check things out and he reported seeing flashing lights in the disc

408
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Among the few other anomalies

409
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,055
One thing is very helpful in this case though that's so absent in a lot of other one

410
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Is that holtkamp

411
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
The very detailed notes

412
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
From his visit to the forest and even made a tape of his binder

413
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Okay you can find

414
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
And if you're interested

415
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:15,647
The rendlesham forest UFO sighting is a gigantic Comedy of Errors from 40 years ago that's been exaggerated Annabelle

416
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
What's my paranormal Inc

417
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Conspiracy scammers

418
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:23,072
And the entire story of it is pretty well explained by people back in 1980s mistaking various things

419
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
As proof of alien

420
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,984
Carrie has recently for some reason become interested in reopening the rendlesham files

421
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,032
And good for her I hope she has fun

422
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
But there's no chance of any government agent mind control

423
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
In a black SUV is going to try and run her off the road because she's doing so

424
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,600
I wanted to get into like the whole thing about rendlesham and like really deconstruct it

425
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
But it's really simple

426
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Here's what happened

427
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
There was

428
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
An object in the sky

429
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,888
Like a meteor they came down near rendlesham documented around the same time

430
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
That this

431
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Nothing happens

432
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,008
Troll people on the night of December 26th

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,128
Very clearly saw what looked to be a fireball basically

434
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,456
Broke into the sky atmosphere explodes

435
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
They go they go and try and examine it realize that

436
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
They don't know where it came down they see a flashing light in the

437
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
The distance and they're like oh my God look at that thing flashing

438
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
Do you get all weirded out

439
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,912
The police, don't find any indications of like a UFO landing or anything like that

440
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Cuz of course.

441
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,008
Two days later this Lieutenant Colonel comes

442
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,848
And he starts poking around they find these little bits of

443
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Evidence

444
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
In quotes

445
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
One of them is

446
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,504
Little divots in the ground

447
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
That they think our Landing site of Christ's other pictures of these a very small

448
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
AR animals

449
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,072
Diggs

450
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,888
He also ends up seeing lights in the disc

451
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
I need note

452
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
That they are flashing at a 5-second

453
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Interval

454
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Now

455
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
There happens

456
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
To be a lighthouse

457
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:14,688
Exactly where those

458
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,624
I saw so many aliens whatever I was driving it Illinois one night

459
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
And there was a lookout off the side of the road there's thousands of blinking red lights

460
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
There is a lighthouse

461
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Where are these

462
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
Is blinking light at was

463
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
Colonel halt he

464
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
Was like his base where he was stationed

465
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Is a different place

466
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Geographically then rendlesham for

467
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
It is to the north

468
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
Of it

469
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
So from his perspective where he normally is

470
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,576
That that Lighthouse is to the southeast

471
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
But since he traveled south to go to rendlesham Forest it was straight to the east

472
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
So when he saw this light

473
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,048
Keep discounted the possibility that it was a lighthouse cuz he was accustomed

474
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Seeing it from the south

475
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
So be prepared and that's even present

476
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
The lighthouses to the southeast

477
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,176
But it's not anymore through the instances of things that people

478
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,552
In 1980 were taking as like indications that there's aliens a foot

479
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,672
And all of this it's all very easily explained by little misunderstandings

480
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Is thinking that

481
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Rabbit diggings

482
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
Our Landing

483
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,936
Right it's a comically lame

484
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
But these sorts of events

485
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,360
Because there is a lot of documentation from the first hand stuff

486
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Like you look at is like

487
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
Oh this is

488
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
We got glasses bad

489
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
I like the idea of a guy not understanding that geography

490
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Doesn't move with him

491
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
Lifelike no matter where he goes on the planet he's like

492
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
Obviously the lighthouses to the southeast

493
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
Of course I can I can kind of understand that not like being first in your mind someone brings it up

494
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
You gotta realize like

495
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Oh wait that's falke.

496
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,712
No one's going to kill carry for looking into this dumb

497
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,808
Is the lieutenant colonel still alive I'm not sure

498
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Does he still own

499
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
That black red Range Rover

500
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
He was alive fairly recently I believe I found some if he actually does believe it's a lie

501
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Aliens now

502
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,656
In direct contradiction of the notes

503
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,008
Now you no longer it looks lieutenant-colonel alright

504
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,872
It's a little weird thing there's a lot of dumb theories about it and there's actually a

505
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Han Oak

506
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,272
Rangy conspiracy about right alright

507
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
No I don't I don't even care

508
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
But anyway it was just a lighthouse

509
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
Anyway now.

510
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,584
Story of this show anyways it was a f****** Lighthouse guys gets into talking about

511
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
The old Coronavirus

512
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,424
Virus

513
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,496
I did not even think that we were going to get Mark Richards

514
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
Opinion on the Coronavirus

515
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm not positive we do

516
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,128
Terry hasn't thoughts

517
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
So there's a big push

518
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Not too

519
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
Allow advertisers to have advertisement

520
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
On

521
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Alternative

522
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Call better talking

523
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,464
And therefore you know Wiley sign

524
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
In

525
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Play some

526
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
If that word

527
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
So that we can get this

528
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
Monetize so that I can see

529
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Pay my rent

530
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
And also I still

531
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Discuss the topic

532
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
The kind of

533
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Censorship

534
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Going on

535
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
On YouTube

536
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Nowadays

537
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
And everyone

538
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
It's aware of it

539
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,784
Renown censorship carries holding up a sign that says

540
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Coronavirus

541
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:09,696
Aoi YouTube as a policy in place where they demonetize videos about topics that they determined to be sensitive

542
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,072
Princeton to there was just a mass shooting videos covering that shooting will often be demonetized

543
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
And if you think about it for a second

544
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,472
This policy makes absolute sense and probably one of the only compromises

545
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,008
That the company can make

546
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
To continue to exist

547
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
And be marginally responsive

548
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,944
The goal is obviously to stop people from spreading misinformation

549
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
Whether intentionally or just by way of sloppy work

550
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:40,160
After shooting you could easily pass along a misidentification of a sub a suspect or erroneous early reports

551
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
Multiple shooters that kind of thing

552
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,048
If you have a platform that's big enough that can be a detriment to the public information

553
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Bass

554
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
In the case of the current coronavirus situation

555
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
Really dangerous for people like Carrie to spread their views

556
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,592
Ally bases off of exit about two weeks ago she released an interview about the coronavirus with Jim Humble

557
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,176
Who happens to be the guy who invented the master mineral supplement

558
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
Oh no

559
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,296
He sold MMS as a cure for everything from hiv-2

560
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
The cancer to Acme

561
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
But it was really just bleach

562
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,512
A lot of the qanon johnny-come-lately when you hear them at like advising people to drink bleach for medicinal reasons

563
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
They're relying on the foundation of Jim humbles work

564
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,472
So if Carrie is going to do an interview with Jim Humble about the virus you can imagine it's full of the sort of information.

565
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
I can help anybody ever made hurt people so these people are treating bleach like the generic version of MMS

566
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
Is essentially what we're like

567
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
It's cheaper to buy Bleach

568
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Then it is to

569
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,552
Yeah so

570
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,392
I maybe didn't want Jim to get a cut whatever

571
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:49,792
I like a gift tickets and big Pharma I haven't done enough digging

572
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,608
Into the qanon side of this or even the

573
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
Sort of non qanon butt

574
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Current batch of weirdos sightings

575
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
I don't even know some of them might actually even be promoting

576
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Jim stop themselves

577
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
It may just be like a jim-jim figured it out

578
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,528
It's like you have people at Carrie and that's the kind of person that she's talking to about

579
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
An actual Public Health situation that's bad

580
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
If your YouTube you want to discourage the

581
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,000
But you also probably don't want to just ban all talk about the virus

582
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,352
You probably don't want to even banal irresponsible talk about the virus and

583
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,472
That cannot be effective stifling content creators feelings about being able to make what they want

584
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,056
The perfect balance is really just a demonetize the subject

585
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,664
If you want to cover cover the virus you're free to do so and YouTube won't censor you

586
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
However if you're trying to spread misinformation for clicks

587
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,600
The demonetization serves as a d motivating factor so you have less incentive

588
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Be Sensational about us

589
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Sensitive topic

590
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,560
It's a tough situation and there's almost certainly some good faith actors who've ended up getting their videos demonetized because of this rule

591
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
But where I in their shoes

592
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656
I would kind of understand that

593
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
And that's really the only way to preserve free expression on YouTube while still catering to the advertisers that'll

594
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,616
Wow videos to be monetized in the first place

595
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,016
If constant demands are made for monetization of videos where Carrie interviews guy wants you to drink bleach

596
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,552
And YouTube goes along with

597
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,928
It's only a matter of time before you're going to driveway all the big money advertising companies that make

598
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Profiting off YouTube even

599
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Possible

600
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
It's basically a killing the Golden Goose situation

601
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,656
It's probably a battle people I carry should realize it's not in their interest to fight

602
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,496
You're only going to end up screwing over the ability to make any money

603
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
By insisting on making money on everything

604
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
It's a dime holding up a dollar

605
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Very stupid

606
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,760
Anyway charismatic about

607
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
I am in Urdu

608
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
You shouldn't profit off of

609
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Terrible

610
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Tragedy

611
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
It seems very cyber

612
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Particularly

613
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,744
Immediate aftermath

614
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
The butt

615
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
You know

616
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
I hate I don't know I don't know where my feelings are on

617
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
On the on the hole

618
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,824
I think if I were creating an Ideal World you have some sort of a way that you wouldn't be able to monetize

619
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
Like what's that you're doing Sandy Hook

620
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,200
Conspiracy videos in 2020 right

621
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
Maybe there should be some

622
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,320
Singing place where you can't find Tyson

623
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,136
Roberts I don't know I don't use YouTube

624
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
All that much

625
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
As a Creator wrap

626
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:31,328
Things I of no idea of it is it is frustrating to not be

627
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,168
I feel like you should be able to ban videos

628
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
The tell you to drink

629
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
That just

630
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Feels like it shouldn't be that hard

631
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
And then you go back

632
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Cancel that you're like

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
Okay well now where's the line and you're like well obvious

634
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:48,992
Hey sweetie I don't know where the goddamn line is but I just know you shouldn't be able to drink bleach

635
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,040
Yeah

636
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
So it's it's a difficult

637
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
The

638
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Thing to figure out where exactly the LIE

639
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
So anyway carries talking about the virus

640
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
And she

641
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:07,424
Are predictably has a pretty similar Theory to Alex but is a little bit Wilder

642
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,288
So there is a a rollout of a step-by-step program

643
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Related

644
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Decreasing population

645
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
And

646
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,200
The step one is triggered by 5.

647
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
I'm listening

648
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
That

649
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Roll out

650
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
Now pierced

651
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
Having an added

652
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Sort of

653
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Plexity level

654
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
If that involves

655
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
What's this

656
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Irolo

657
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,048
The two are

658
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Really link

659
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
And I've done another

660
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Video on this

661
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
That

662
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
It's been getting out there

663
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Quite well

664
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
I can say the Chemtrails and Nano or

665
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Are also part of that

666
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Concoction

667
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,176
So you got Chemtrails and 5G being combined virus

668
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
I mean that's very similar to a lot of

669
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Alex

670
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Conspiracies

671
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
The depopulation

672
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,904
Aspect of it is absolutely and play and Alex's fairies

673
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
These

674
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
So all the aliens are basically like witches in Macbeth just throwing all of these different things in a cup

675
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
Cauldron trying to get all of human Humanity to die yeah I think so I will spell it out a little bit more

676
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
Later in the interview about exactly how the aliens play into it but for now it's 5G trigger

677
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
Virus

678
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,784
That are yeah that may be involved in chemtrails

679
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
She doesn't get loopback to explain how Chemtrails are involved but they're always in

680
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
The stage one is this 5G activation of stock market has some news about stage 2

681
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Plan

682
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
There's also a

683
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Benchmark

684
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
The Step2 will be more Earth changes

685
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
Is there man-made

686
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
And a set of

687
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Droughts

688
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,336
That are going

689
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Creating limitations

690
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,664
Resource

691
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Especially water

692
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
And limitation

693
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Time travel

694
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
So these are key items to

695
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
To keep in mind

696
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Going forward

697
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,184
This is just fanfiction about the consequences of climate change

698
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,584
That's reasonable of course there's going to be drowsy

699
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Play Changes.

700
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,960
Yeah totally cheesy aliens

701
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Driving Factor behind it apart she's not saying it's because of like fossil fuel

702
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
She's Angus

703
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,504
Aliens are directing humans to do that

704
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Great you get there you got to go do not in this case not in this case

705
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,768
Escape the conclusion invalidates the the

706
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
The correct

707
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Okay thank the trees asserting

708
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728
Okay so maybe if instead she said we need to switch to all renewable fuels in order to stick it

709
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
It's Abigail

710
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
I mean yeah that might be okay

711
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,152
Okay at least that would be productively dumb

712
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,456
So will you back to rendlesham now

713
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
She's jumping all over

714
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
UA

715
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
Earlier I was kind of expressing a little bit of

716
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,648
Confusion why is she

717
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
Deciding to reopen this cold case

718
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
I mean

719
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Really cold cakes

720
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,584
Do regarding rendlesham we had a fascinating discussion

721
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
And I had received

722
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
The psychic

723
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Psychic message

724
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Telling me

725
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Truth is

726
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Set the case

727
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
It happened in 1980

728
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
A lot of the psychic

729
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
I started to change their

730
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Your stories

731
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
I've been changing their stories

732
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Have been

733
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
In conflict

734
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
With each other

735
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
And are suspicious

736
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Beach other

737
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
And there's a lot of evidence

738
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Of mine can

739
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Between the

740
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Witnesses

741
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
Eminem

742
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
I don't know what the evidence of mind

743
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Control

744
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
That sounds more like evidence with some of them our lives

745
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Yeah

746
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,240
So Jenny Randalls is the person who first primarily cover the rendlesham story in the

747
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,824
The press in the London evening standard and even wrote an early book about

748
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
At the event

749
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,200
Her works are largely credited with building some of the early hype surrounding the alleged sighting

750
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
But in 2011 she said quote

751
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,040
Well some puzzles remain weak

752
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,392
Can probably say that no unearthly craft were seeing in rendlesham forest

753
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,768
Who we can also argue with confidence that the main focus of the events was a series of misperception

754
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,048
Kinds of everyday things

755
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Is encountered in less than everyday circumstance

756
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,680
That's one person who changed their tune but it's not reason

757
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,080
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Holt story is also change but it changed to support the UFO View

758
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,944
He currently believes that UFO did show a back in 1980 which like I mentioned earlier

759
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
Relies on him kind of negating a bunch of documented evidence that some of it

760
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,856
He himself created

761
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
Control he's on mine controller

762
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Another person who change their story is Jim Henson

763
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Peniston

764
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,280
Why choose one of the patrolman from

765
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
The first night's affair

766
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632
You now claims that you touch the UFO at night

767
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:02,080
But we need anybody weirdly that was never mentioned when he was initially interviewed about what happened around the 10 top

768
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
First thing you mentioned

769
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,920
He's changed his story

770
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
Seems to me to be two sorts of people who are changing their stories

771
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
This case people who were supportive of the UFO narrative initially who changed their position based on evidence

772
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,232
That's an explanation of what was being misperceived

773
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:25,888
The other are people who were initially skeptical who change their position to believe in the UFO narrative without any real reason

774
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
Sometimes needing to contradict

775
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Actual evidence

776
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
See mine

777
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,592
If I were someone who's involved in this event I would probably also view everyone else's

778
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,200
There are clearly some scammers in the mix and I don't know

779
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
I don't know that's not good

780
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,088
Touched

781
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,416
So there's a cover-up going on here obviously

782
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Now

783
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
It's obvious this cover-up

784
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
It has to do with

785
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,376
UFO in England

786
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Yes

787
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,192
But did you know that it also has to do

788
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
With our

789
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
Electoral system

790
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
Now regarding rendlesham

791
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
There is a presence

792
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Behind the scene

793
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
Of the user

794
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
Usual Suspects regarding

795
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Mind control

796
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,296
And that is the name

797
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
That I've got

798
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Listed here

799
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
And are they short

800
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Time and time again

801
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
With regard to cover-ups

802
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
And that includes the alien autopsy

803
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
The takedown of

804
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
Nixon our president

805
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,400
Back in those

806
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,424
Stay the course

807
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:38,080
Nixon president in 1980

808
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Rendlesham

809
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
Fair but

810
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,992
Yeah I don't I don't know if the the Nixon impeachment was mine

811
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,320
Control

812
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
This guy Mark Richards

813
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
By virtue of

814
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
There their connection carriers

815
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
Always right about it

816
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
So the cover-up

817
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Is mine

818
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Incontrol based

819
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:06,240
It extends to the alien autopsy and the Nixon impeachment girls are all over there

820
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
Is that are unclear

821
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
But it's alright all basically about magic haha

822
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
And

823
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
These individuals are

824
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Pi lira

825
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
You know our remote viewers involved in remote

826
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
Viewing involved in the

827
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Conation

828
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Putting together

829
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
The protocols with

830
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
The swan

831
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
Of the original

832
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
Remote

833
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Viewing product

834
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
And

835
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
This involved

836
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:30,816
Scientology

837
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Practice

838
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
As well

839
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
So it's it's important to know that all of that

840
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Is

841
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
Just

842
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Information

843
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,824
Where packaging information

844
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
A way of using your psychic abilities

845
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
He's in

846
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Ascertain

847
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Controlled way

848
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
To access

849
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,040
Events

850
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
An end

851
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,648
Future Past and Present events

852
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,696
Things going on

853
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
That are

854
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
What we call signal non-locality

855
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
And

856
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,376
Spooky action-at-a-distance these are all terms

857
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Related to that

858
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
No they're not welcome back to this

859
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,496
Reactions at a distance

860
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,384
A great expression

861
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,504
What they called and what they call it I love it

862
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
There's a lot of

863
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Information and

864
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
An investigation that

865
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
Sit down around this

866
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
It also has been around for

867
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
From time

868
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,464
Immemorial

869
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Not under these

870
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Name

871
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
But certainly practice

872
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Spy Dark Magician

873
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
And like magicians

874
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Everywhere

875
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Witches

876
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
You know warlocks you name it

877
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Around the blue name

878
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Just for

879
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Freon

880
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
So

881
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
It's important to know this

882
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
This is not new

883
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
It is simply been

884
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
Put into a kind of a

885
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Protocol and

886
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,504
Scientology

887
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
She has also been

888
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Instrumental

889
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:02,208
So your theory from Pastor Mike Richards Kerry Cassidy episode

890
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,744
Involvement in Scientology

891
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,584
Might be sounding a little less crazy now

892
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
So apparently Scientology is just a

893
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
The formulation of the

894
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
Making yourself able to use magical powers

895
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,360
That witches and warlocks you name it I've been using forever

896
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,432
That's not good I mean

897
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,504
I do like the idea that

898
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,160
It's okay now to just be like what he does know how to use Magic

899
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Right

900
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,888
Sure he got that Elemental with him and they f****** rolled out you know that's the real issue

901
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
That's totally what you start about she's like we're making people clear but that's not El wrong thing that's actually what f******

902
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,919
John Deere 1600 what if I were to tell you that

903
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:59,039
Instead of allowing you to use magic it's a blackmail racket

904
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
What

905
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
What is blackmail but black magic

906
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Certainly

907
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:09,023
So we carry talking here about rendlesham and I we get some of Mark's

908
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
Perspective on it

909
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
And I don't

910
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
He's correct

911
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Mark said

912
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
That

913
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
The reason they're such a cover-up

914
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Of the rentals

915
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,567
Is that there were over two hundred people

916
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
Affected in the radius of the inside

917
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
The aliens

918
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,479
We're attempting to land this is had been there

919
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
Second or third

920
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Make contact with humans

921
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
What happened

922
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
In this Landing

923
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Attempt

924
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
They used

925
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Telepathy

926
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
To communicate with

927
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Around

928
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
He said there were both civilians

929
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
And Military

930
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Attendance

931
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
And

932
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
That lends itself to the idea that the landing

933
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Was

934
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Free

935
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Arranged

936
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
And

937
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
This also went over

938
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
On over

939
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
Appeared of eight days as

940
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Supposed to

941
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Three that are you

942
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
They talked about

943
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
This is all made up

944
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:09,951
No no come on it's alien Hanukkah damn what's so fun when there's a cover-up you could

945
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,719
You say anything

946
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,327
Doesn't need to match anything cuz there's a cover-up or any can see this in the like

947
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
None of this next clip means

948
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
A f****** thing

949
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,471
When the aliens

950
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,543
Projected the images into the humans

951
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Mine

952
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,103
A lot of the humans

953
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Couldn't handle it

954
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,943
What they were projecting where images not only

955
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,759
Have themselves but also of other races David

956
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Encountered

957
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
Right so other

958
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,647
Planets

959
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
This sort of

960
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Package of

961
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Telepathic

962
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Formation

963
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Freak

964
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
The Americans

965
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
And the British

966
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
All those in

967
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
In attendance

968
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,655
Out I think

969
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,959
I think Mark's been reading Lovecraft

970
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,287
I really just think is really like

971
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:59,615
This is just like Shadow out of time or

972
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Ready

973
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:09,599
Pretty similar to a couple of Minecraft stories

974
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Make things a lot more complicated like

975
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,463
If this is their second or third time trying to contact

976
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,839
Don't they already know that their psychic abilities

977
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Yeah

978
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,263
Who's Carrie actually speculate later that there the spider leadership the spiders were involved

979
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
I thought they're going to be rabbit

980
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,615
I hope you only thing

981
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
The only thing that makes sense to me

982
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
Spiders are like are you guys look last time

983
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
It's really did not go well

984
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
People Freak the Freak Out

985
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Let's try it again

986
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Guys

987
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,719
I propose we don't change a thing

988
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,071
Probably just those people talk

989
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
Different people work differently

990
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
The great. Does humanize the aliens quite a bit

991
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,239
Spiders

992
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Most likely

993
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Terry's Pizza

994
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
So

995
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,943
Bunch of people freaked out couldn't handle it cuz I saw a bunch of alien beings and their head

996
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
Classic Warcraft

997
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:16,159
Catch a glimpse of another world to drive you mad

998
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
So I bet you might think like okay then

999
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
What

1000
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
Happened with them

1001
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:29,983
Wouldn't they still be raving mad people throughout rendlesham do while turns out

1002
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,287
Mark might have also seen been in

1003
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,079
A lot of the humans never

1004
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
Recovered their memories

1005
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
Or white

1006
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Afterwards

1007
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Military Mike

1008
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Patrol

1009
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Attempts were made in that regard

1010
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Some of those humans

1011
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Lost neuralyzer

1012
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Recovered

1013
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,439
Then there was also a

1014
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Exchange of Fire

1015
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
Because when

1016
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
There was an overload

1017
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
From

1018
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
The aliens

1019
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
A few minutes

1020
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Humans react

1021
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
And

1022
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Then the aliens reacted

1023
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
The humans reacted

1024
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,543
There was an emotional overload

1025
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
That went to the

1026
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Artificial

1027
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
That the aliens brought with them

1028
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Who then reacted

1029
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
To the overload of

1030
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Emotional

1031
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Energy

1032
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
And apparently

1033
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,159
One side or the other open fire I'm not sure which

1034
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,951
There was friendly fire

1035
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Clear all the circle

1036
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,863
This is madness

1037
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,703
Adding that little detail of this is their second or third time just make sense

1038
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
So much better

1039
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:40,127
Afterwards if you're the spider that was in charge of this you're getting called into a meeting with your boss

1040
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
Hey

1041
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Hey

1042
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
You should know better

1043
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,295
You let this happen this is an event

1044
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,975
I thought before it was just the humans got f***** up now I know that we're creating a feedback loop or everybody except aliens

1045
00:46:55,231 --> 00:47:01,375
Gunfire and the aliens ever using like human weapons or else they would leave evidence of alien

1046
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:07,775
Weapon discharges all over the place because they're both in this feedback loop

1047
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
Trigger emotional overload

1048
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:16,479
Yep holy s*** that this is a quite disaster the first

1049
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:22,879
It was just we later the rug spot we got to go to the UK

1050
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
And dudes just like

1051
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,975
You're so fired

1052
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
We have to do a 40-year cover-up about this and how

1053
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,095
Do you understand

1054
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
Oh that's really f****** up at your job

1055
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Centralia

1056
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:43,359
Bexar I worked at Groupon I got a price wrong on one of the deals

1057
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,663
Oh yeah huge mistake that I ended up

1058
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Having to get in trouble for

1059
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
I worked out okay but it was a big

1060
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Chaotic day

1061
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
I can't imagine if I was that spider

1062
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,135
Holy s*** I would recommend it

1063
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,231
So anyway.

1064
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,399
But actually it might be okay because Mark met a guy

1065
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Marcos

1066
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
So said he is met a man near

1067
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Salinas California

1068
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,031
Who was an MP at the

1069
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,567
The time wasn't attendance

1070
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
On the rental

1071
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
Meeting and Landing

1072
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
And he

1073
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
He said he's never regained

1074
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Is memories

1075
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
Completely but lost his mind and then

1076
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Either

1077
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
And

1078
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
That this

1079
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
This was

1080
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
So that this was covered up

1081
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
And I'm in a huge way

1082
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Alright

1083
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,839
That makes sense I love this I love this type of

1084
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:39,935
Storytelling like it's my favorite type of story. Have You Ever Seen The Magicians

1085
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,079
The Sci-Fi show no I have not

1086
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
Introduce a problem and then immediately know the guy who can

1087
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Can solve 0 time difference between them just like hey

1088
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,087
I don't know if this is true or not will guess what I know a guy

1089
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Viet

1090
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:03,999
Well I'm also one of the things that I have a little bit of a problem with here is that Mark

1091
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:09,375
Committed that murder in 1982 to prison in 1984

1092
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Right

1093
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:17,055
Here's the thing that event took place in December 1980 so there was a

1094
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Former MP

1095
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
Who was

1096
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
There who lost his mind

1097
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:28,575
Reef way to go 84 if you met this guy in Salinas

1098
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
To be this guy was an MP lost his mind went to California was wondering

1099
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,791
The window is small and unless

1100
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
Of course astral travel

1101
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,655
Spooky action over discharge or absolutely

1102
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Idle by the

1103
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
Anyway

1104
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:53,407
So the coronavirus and Mark is a depopulation

1105
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Playing course

1106
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,967
And we know this

1107
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,319
I don't I don't believe

1108
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,647
How many months prior to this whole occurrence

1109
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,183
And Breakout

1110
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
Of this

1111
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
So-called virus

1112
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Basically

1113
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
There was a plan

1114
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
According tomorrow

1115
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
Talk to eliminate

1116
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
500ml

1117
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,263
Chinese

1118
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
This was their plan

1119
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,335
This is liquid leak

1120
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
To Mark and

1121
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
I guess it's

1122
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Group that

1123
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
He works with in the

1124
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Really

1125
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,783
And they were

1126
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Reply. What I know

1127
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
I'm going down this path

1128
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
Obviously they failed

1129
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Important point

1130
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:40,255
It's so cold virus

1131
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
It was leaked to mark

1132
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Yep

1133
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
By the people you work for the military

1134
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Sure it was

1135
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
But you also see similarities

1136
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
Is between her narrative and Alex's narrative

1137
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:55,871
In terms of China wanting to depopulate there was a Chinese plan

1138
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,223
All of this is very closely in line with the lot of things that have the underpinning

1139
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,295
Of up till this point at least Alex's

1140
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
Conspiracy narrative about this

1141
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,415
Which is weird weird

1142
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Immensely enjoyed

1143
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
So-called

1144
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,815
You can put that in front of everything and everybody's like

1145
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,447
Another similarity between her view of this and Ally

1146
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
There's no doubt that this

1147
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,263
Is a

1148
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
This version

1149
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Bioweapon

1150
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
But it will mute

1151
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
And it

1152
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
Is triggered

1153
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
As well

1154
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
55g

1155
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
And

1156
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
Mark was not

1157
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Clear on whether that

1158
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
The case a lot of Bend

1159
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Investigation has

1160
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
Dan driessen

1161
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,927
So here you see a similarity and a

1162
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,999
Kind of different as far as I've heard

1163
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
I'm committed to the 5G

1164
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,351
Necessarily being involved

1165
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:54,239
I have heard at least a call her makeup on me didn't push back on it just entertained on Alex's Chevrolet

1166
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,639
But you have them a fuller version hear of it is a bioweapon it's triggered by 5G their interconnect

1167
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
Also at the end are you heard like

1168
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
This is just Carrie

1169
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Mark didn't even say that

1170
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,087
Yep this is supposed to be about her interview with Mark

1171
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
She saying he didn't say that you know what so far

1172
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
I think she knows something and that is

1173
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
Mark was not having a good day so he's not bringing the Heat

1174
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
He said she said he said he

1175
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:28,799
He just didn't know he's supposed to like Selena

1176
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
Give me a

1177
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Mark doesn't know

1178
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,687
So this next clip is kind of where my brain just was like

1179
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
I don't even know what to do and I stared

1180
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,599
My computer for like 5 minutes after hearing this is just like I don't

1181
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
I don't know what's going on

1182
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
There's evidence even in the documentation

1183
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Behind 5G

1184
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
Saying that

1185
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
It will

1186
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
That oxygen

1187
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Is

1188
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Actually

1189
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
It attracts

1190
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Oxygen

1191
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Attracts 5G

1192
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Somehow there's

1193
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,591
Some kind of relationship there between

1194
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
By the frequency

1195
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
5 gm

1196
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
And that

1197
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,479
Consequence humans

1198
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Around it

1199
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,319
Trouble breathing I just didn't know I don't know what to do

1200
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:17,951
I don't know what to do oxygen attracts 5G 5G attract oxygen I don't know what's going on

1201
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,999
That's the kind of thing that makes me wonder is higher than

1202
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,583
In the closet I don't I can't I can't I can't

1203
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,911
Do this when somebody says oxygen attracts 5G

1204
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
You stop everything and you listen

1205
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:34,591
Very non-specific

1206
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
How do you think Alex

1207
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,527
Give me any kind of reasonable way that oxygen could attract 5

1208
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,343
Well you see oxygen what is it right

1209
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:51,231
That literally or is that likely give me what is the chemical compound

1210
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Roblox

1211
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Oxygen

1212
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
HO2

1213
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
I understand

1214
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,679
But oxygen molecules attracted to each other

1215
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,311
Alright so we're dealing with an isotope of oxygen

1216
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,871
Maybe I don't know and I don't know

1217
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
I hear stuff like that and I just

1218
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,479
I almost get into like

1219
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Trance

1220
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
No

1221
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,599
I know I just don't understand how you can say that

1222
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,695
So there's a lot of people who have got the Coronavirus

1223
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,767
Covid-19 there's a lot of people who

1224
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
Particularly in China is large

1225
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,863
Numbers of people who have passed away

1226
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,703
Because of complications in the pneumonia and what have you

1227
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,519
Gary would say that this is not true

1228
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
And in fact

1229
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
There's something else going on

1230
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
So as of

1231
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
February 6th

1232
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,967
The numbers Mark had was 100,000 humor

1233
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Involved

1234
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
He said 30

1235
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,807
Percent had died 30

1236
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,343
Affected

1237
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,623
And 40% were

1238
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,647
Taking off world in

1239
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Shipt other planet

1240
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
Anti-sexual

1241
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
Insofar

1242
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,167
Okay okay

1243
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
It's a cover for the Raptors a reptilian drives me to take 40% off of $100

1244
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
Enzo 40,000

1245
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,663
Yeah people off-planet to f***

1246
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
And eat

1247
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
Okay

1248
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:24,415
I think that seems like a lot of work it's frustrating that seems like a lot of work

1249
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
Right considering they could just

1250
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,631
I don't know whatever they do all the time are they doing this all the time like in wars and anytime anytime is like an earthquake

1251
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
Play Kismet cover for aliens

1252
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,727
Taking people to f****** eat

1253
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
You don't need to

1254
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
You go to look

1255
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,639
You know you're sometimes you order the same meal at a bunch of different restaurants

1256
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
You go for the atmos

1257
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:51,807
You know sometimes you need to get that food in a different wet you know that maybe this is their version

1258
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Tiki-themed

1259
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,975
Sure sometimes you order out sometimes you want to walk to the store to pick it up you know it's different mood

1260
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Yeah that's very stupid

1261
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,815
So it turns out

1262
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
There's a lot going on and what it has to do with

1263
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,215
And a grander level is aliens taking over the

1264
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
And

1265
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,799
I started

1266
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,615
You hear a lot of things that are very similar

1267
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
2

1268
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,479
When Alex talks about what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole

1269
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,015
When he starts talking about

1270
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
Be evil demonic spirits that are behind the global it right which are totally real and they are spirits and they are not a

1271
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,463
Aliens are silly

1272
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
Seems to me

1273
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
There's a lot of similarities retox about the Draco

1274
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:44,543
And The Reptilian and Alex talks about the demons that are behind the globalist

1275
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
We are fighting a battle

1276
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Planet Earth

1277
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Against

1278
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
They're inter

1279
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Appearance

1280
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
Here on the planet

1281
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,711
As well as

1282
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
Their plans to

1283
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
To terraform this

1284
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Planet

1285
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
So none of this is really

1286
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Really all that

1287
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
New

1288
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,183
Added element of

1289
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Of course of five

1290
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
She has Escalade

1291
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
The symptoms

1292
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
Situation

1293
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,863
Attracting too much oxygen rollout of chemtrails

1294
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Implantation

1295
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
Implantation of Nano

1296
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,751
In the chemtrails

1297
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,031
House and in our bodies

1298
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
This is all part of the agenda

1299
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
The push to make

1300
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
Make a trance human agenda

1301
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,943
And also change

1302
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,991
The environment here on planet Earth

1303
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
2

1304
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
To make it a more methane

1305
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,111
Like environment all of this is

1306
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
It's been covered by

1307
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
By Project Camelot

1308
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,951
In my interviews

1309
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
In my present

1310
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Temptations

1311
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
For many years

1312
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,935
The transhumanist agenda is something that Alex talks about a whole lot and being away to make a

1313
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,751
World where these demonic forces can

1314
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,663
I don't know how to drag drag queen Story Hour into this would be like oh we just got bingo

1315
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,711
You nailed it yeah

1316
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,783
Planet Alex talks all the time about how we're actually

1317
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,367
Carbon starved

1318
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:07,231
The Cowboys are trying to change the environment eat whenever he gets really

1319
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:13,631
Died like grasping Hill pull-out childhood's end and how the the aliens in childhood

1320
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:18,239
Zen needed to create the environment in a different way for them to be able to

1321
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,823
I exist like this is all very similar to

1322
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Like just pulling things from

1323
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,175
Probably the same sci-fi sources

1324
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,479
And just packaging them in different ways

1325
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
In order to either push

1326
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,087
A paranormal conspiracy world or a political

1327
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Conspiracy world

1328
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
And

1329
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
Baby Wilson record

1330
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:41,535
Acknowledge that by Alex it might as well be buying into carries s***

1331
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,071
Cuz the same

1332
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
Level of reasonability

1333
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,191
Yeah we said last week said it was recently it's just like

1334
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,519
Like the only difference between those is your flavor of sci-fi so

1335
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
And it just goes on I'm in the similarities or are very

1336
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,175
ISO reptilians and Draco RS

1337
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Assisting China with their population

1338
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
Reduction print

1339
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Plans

1340
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
According to mark

1341
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,087
China doesn't need help

1342
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
From the West

1343
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
To eliminate

1344
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Population

1345
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
And there

1346
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Doing this on their own

1347
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,815
So anyone who you happy in this scenario

1348
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Boo

1349
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:21,471
I mean taking aside that kind of callus and shity perspective

1350
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,311
You replace Draco and repealing the globalist there at the beginning

1351
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
The sentence

1352
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:33,247
The globalist are helping China with population reduction very easily comes out of Alex's mouth

1353
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
Very easily

1354
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,831
Call the same s***

1355
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,111
So

1356
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,415
That carry will tell you that some opportunist

1357
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:44,511
Are out there and they're trying to use the coronavirus for their own purposes

1358
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
Maybe

1359
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,839
To get more attention

1360
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:52,191
To your videos that are monetized on YouTube or

1361
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,823
Oportun

1362
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
There are Opera

1363
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
Fortunus out there that are taking advantage

1364
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
Of this

1365
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Roll out

1366
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
Of obviously

1367
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
This

1368
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
And I

1369
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
And and and

1370
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
More

1371
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
IR

1372
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Basically using

1373
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
The weaponized

1374
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
Mutation of it

1375
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
2

1376
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
2

1377
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
Attack their own

1378
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
People

1379
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
It is

1380
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
No coincidence

1381
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
That the highest rate

1382
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Pics of

1383
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
CVS

1384
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
Are also showing up

1385
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Around the world

1386
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Inflation

1387
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
Is where 5G

1388
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Has been installed

1389
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:40,831
There's a problem with this argument that carries making and that's what it's not really possible to trace a one-to-one relationship

1390
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,647
Chipitin coronavirus cases and availability of 5G

1391
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
D coverage

1392
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,463
One glaring example of this

1393
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,559
Is that there's a particularly bad outbreak in Iran

1394
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:56,703
According to press tv there is no 5G programming a run as of February 13th 2020 but

1395
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,055
There are plans in place to begin launching one in the coming Persian calendar year

1396
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
Which just began this month

1397
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
So that kind of dozen

1398
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Makes sense

1399
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
4 Cal AR

1400
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,039
South Korea is another country with a ton of cases of Coronavirus

1401
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
This is an interesting study

1402
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
Before the 5G Ark

1403
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:19,999
The largest number of cases are in the area of Daegu which does have 5G coverage

1404
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
But

1405
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
The capital Seoul

1406
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,119
Elsa is a very robust 5G networking place

1407
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,423
It has relatively few cases of the virus

1408
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
There doesn't seem to be to be a

1409
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,263
Determinant of vector

1410
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,591
And given the kinds of datapoint to see the two

1411
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,383
Far more likely there's something else

1412
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,919
Another variable at play

1413
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,199
The carrier's ignoring

1414
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
In order to push

1415
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
Her 5G

1416
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
Conspiracy paranoia

1417
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,623
Perfect sense okay Iran is trying to roll out this 5

1418
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,743
And then there is it's like an oil spill you know some of the 5G got out

1419
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,559
Before they were ready for it so that's why there's so many

1420
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,959
It's just contain better where is Dago's they have a terrible 5G containment system

1421
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Getting all that

1422
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Jean going around everybody script

1423
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,615
Similarly Italy has had a lot of cases of the virus

1424
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Sorry my bad

1425
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,991
But they only have partial 5G coverage in select cities

1426
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,807
In 2019 they launched 5G in Milan

1427
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,415
Torin and bologna which are all cities that have had some relevant coronavirus activity

1428
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,999
But the problem is they also launched 5G in Rome and Naples

1429
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,071
Would you seem relatively very little virus activity

1430
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,631
The next country with the most cases of Germany

1431
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,703
There is currently no 5G Network in Germany

1432
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:38,335
Are there maybe if you stay antennas around the country that are experimenting with implementation but there's

1433
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Nothing you would call 5G

1434
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Coverage

1435
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
They're currently wireless companies making bids to build out and according to an article in January from

1436
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
MyTouch you well

1437
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,623
The whole thing isn't its infancy

1438
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,231
For telefonica Germany was quoted as saying quote by the end of

1439
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,583
2021 the company wants to offer 5G in the five largest German cities

1440
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,983
And by 2022 it wants to expand to be 30 biggest cities

1441
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:11,103
So the next hardest-hit country is France and they too are in the early stages of 5G deployment

1442
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:17,759
It's easy to see China and South Korea being hit very hard by this outbreak and save those countries are on the Forefront of

1443
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
5G so these things must be connected

1444
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
But that kind of thinking requires completely ignoring a

1445
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
Ton of other variables

1446
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,231
Factors which is kind of the Project Camelot specialty

1447
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,023
When you look at the actual country

1448
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,863
Like it's all good and well and fun to say the countries that are hit the most

1449
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,911
Are the ones that rolled out 5G

1450
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,727
It's just it doesn't match the reality so

1451
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
You're wrong

1452
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,567
It's just wrong they're not good with Nuance or

1453
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
Variable like

1454
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,479
It's the same way that she described feels good that she described like

1455
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,039
In that b******* callus

1456
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,855
The awful clip where she's like oh well the Chinese

1457
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
Have no problem killing themselves so they are not victim

1458
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
Considering it's like

1459
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,071
At no point in time does she accept that there's a difference between Chinese people

1460
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
Like Chinese people are people

1461
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
Like it she treats them the same way that she

1462
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,775
She treats the alien races of like football that means in the same way all time

1463
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,895
Chinese people do this leadership killing them or whatever it's them all doing it

1464
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,735
Essentialist argument that

1465
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Give my perspective that she has

1466
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,831
It's about classes

1467
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,879
F***** up yeah it's it's very weird

1468
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
And

1469
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
And dumb

1470
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
So

1471
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:37,119
To get back to more Alex Jones Connections in this next clip she discusses how humans are

1472
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
There's a plan in place

1473
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
That's moving forward to make humans

1474
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,751
Part AI which is

1475
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
Alex talks about a lot

1476
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
Uncle why didn't you write we talk

1477
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
About

1478
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,615
What is that

1479
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Humans

1480
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Art

1481
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Slated to

1482
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
To become partially ailife

1483
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Transhuman

1484
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Species at the

1485
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
This time

1486
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,831
Although Mark Fields

1487
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
What's that

1488
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
The transhumanist

1489
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,159
Agenda will not be allowed

1490
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:00,927
What happened

1491
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
Because he's he believes there's enough

1492
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
Military men like

1493
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
That are against it

1494
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
There's the big

1495
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,935
Issue is they cannot tell

1496
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
Exactly

1497
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
When we move

1498
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
From being

1499
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
AI

1500
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
From being human to being

1501
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
AI

1502
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,175
And there

1503
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
At which you

1504
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Become

1505
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
Mora

1506
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
AI than you

1507
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
I'm human

1508
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,599
Is a philosophical argument that I'm not positive

1509
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,927
She and Mark had

1510
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,511
I mean the Cubans are slighted

1511
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,047
Become part AI

1512
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:43,167
He's probably not going to work because there's a human resistance within the military is

1513
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
Classic Alex

1514
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
That is very very

1515
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:51,615
Very out that they need to get the coup taking

1516
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:58,015
In Caribbean and that's how we're going to get rid of 5G or partially or whatever it is you like

1517
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,599
So turns out draco's

1518
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,879
Bad news

1519
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,159
Bad news

1520
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
Does Draco

1521
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,511
No good they're fighting the Raptors in space right

1522
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
And it turns out that a lot of things that happened on Earth

1523
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Actually part of that battle

1524
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,239
So he said that there's a draco battle in the Ryan Galaxy

1525
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,263
And a lot of what it's been

1526
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
Been happening on Earth

1527
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
To do with that bat

1528
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
In that better

1529
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
Battle.

1530
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
Drake or

1531
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
Fighting with

1532
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
The Raptors

1533
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
And

1534
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
The Raptors

1535
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,087
Have recruited 1 million humans

1536
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,135
For fighting with them against the

1537
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
The Draco

1538
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
At the same time

1539
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
The Draco and ripped

1540
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,999
Killian's the reptilians

1541
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
I are working with

1542
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
China

1543
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
In order to

1544
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
Distract the rap

1545
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
Here on Earth

1546
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
And Aki

1547
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Occupy them

1548
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
And to take therapy

1549
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
Oceanway from

1550
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,567
Here on Earth

1551
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Get them to fight in

1552
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Battling

1553
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Galaxy

1554
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,455
And so that they can

1555
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
Can take over Earth

1556
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,783
So it's a takeover scenario

1557
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
This is a kind of Battle of going on

1558
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Between

1559
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,671
What we call good evil but it's

1560
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
It's really

1561
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
A Transformer

1562
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
Agenda

1563
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,839
The end

1564
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
Yeah I hear stuff like I was like okay

1565
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,983
I like

1566
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
I'll let you

1567
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Put that out there

1568
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
I love the new

1569
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,639
I love whenever they have specific

1570
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
Play Dido like

1571
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
Of course the Raptors need

1572
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
1 million humans

1573
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Bright the exact number

1574
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
Child Roku

1575
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
What kind of s*** like

1576
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
You don't know how many people are a lot of

1577
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,303
People also I feel like this plan is self-contradictory

1578
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:53,215
So there's a pre-existing war between the dracos and the Raptors that is in space

1579
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:58,335
I'm going to try and walk through this

1580
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
So

1581
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Draco

1582
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,711
Leaving Raptors in space Battle of good and

1583
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,247
So

1584
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,063
The Draco are coming to Earth

1585
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
And using the Chinese

1586
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,927
In order to distract the Raptors right

1587
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:17,279
Because they want to distract them from the battle in space

1588
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
Right

1589
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:22,143
In order to lure the Raptor forces here so they can have success

1590
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
In space

1591
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
But then she says

1592
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,519
That it's a plan to take over Earth

1593
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
But it seems like Earth

1594
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:35,455
Is really the distraction for the Orion rice battle what is actually going on here

1595
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:40,831
Not be important but then ultimately it seems like she saying that it it's the ultimate goal

1596
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:47,231
Well I think it's a lot like it's a lot like how is like World War

1597
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
Faces go back and forth you wouldn't do that but what it was

1598
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,287
To get the French over there and then they Retreat from that base and then go take over another one and that's why they were in

1599
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Listed with the Raptor

1600
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
Planning

1601
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,455
Jordan that bass but they used as a factor

1602
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Is not important

1603
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
That's

1604
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:14,111
I think that means that we're not important in this scenario

1605
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,463
Still curious make us the most important because it's narcissism

1606
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:25,375
Either bait or where the heroes one of the two can't really do both

1607
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,959
Similarities of Alex

1608
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,031
And I just whenever I listen

1609
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
Do this now

1610
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
Is just such a

1611
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
Stark

1612
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,199
Contact contact

1613
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Between

1614
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,527
The evil force behind the globalist

1615
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
And the Drake

1616
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,111
Salmos 121

1617
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,391
There is a relation

1618
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Between

1619
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
The Draco

1620
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
And reptilian

1621
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
And the Gracie

1622
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
To report to them

1623
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
As well as

1624
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
What's called there

1625
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
Put package

1626
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Together

1627
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
In

1628
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
Terminology

1629
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,983
He called the luciferian alliance

1630
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
On humans

1631
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,871
Blood Fever

1632
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:12,735
And they're luciferian there's the Satanism that's wild

1633
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,783
So there is a race

1634
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,367
That used to be around called the Anunnaki and they were humanoid

1635
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
Species

1636
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
And now they're helping

1637
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
With the bad guy

1638
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
Which makes them look globalists

1639
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,863
Oso the Anunnaki are helping the draconi okay okay

1640
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
Which makes them the globalists in the scenario that are doing the bidding or The Vinoy door whatever there

1641
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
The bidding

1642
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,359
Of the Draco evil force

1643
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
It's also

1644
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Significant

1645
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
As I've said

1646
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Before that

1647
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Anunnaki

1648
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
He were taking over

1649
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,807
Also by this reptilian

1650
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Agenda

1651
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
By the Draco

1652
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
And so what you have at the

1653
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
This time is it

1654
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Draco

1655
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,975
Anunnaki

1656
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Dihybrid

1657
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Race

1658
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
And this is off

1659
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,815
Often wear

1660
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Anunnaki

1661
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
You're considered

1662
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,215
Or thought to be reptilian when a real reality they are a humanoid

1663
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Many

1664
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,079
Eons ago

1665
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
And

1666
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,639
The Draco

1667
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Are helping

1668
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
China to obtain their goal

1669
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
5 eliminating

1670
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
A certain portion

1671
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Troy

1672
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,879
So there is a sense that we have invader

1673
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:30,047
Always always always invaded so you got the Anunnaki or humanoids who are doing the bidding of

1674
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
The dracos

1675
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,607
China

1676
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
It's all this

1677
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,703
I do I do see like

1678
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:39,775
Here's what I see going on with this is

1679
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:46,175
Is like when the protocols of the Elders of Zion was written there was a committee there and they were all

1680
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,503
Call pitching ideas for what it was they were doing and one guy

1681
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
It was just like

1682
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,367
I know we're talk about Jews but what if it was a lie

1683
01:11:54,879 --> 01:12:01,023
And they're like it this guy the f*** out of here and granddaughter

1684
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
So

1685
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
We'll get back to some of this weird

1686
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
S***

1687
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
But it has to be interrupted Baha'i

1688
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,591
Claim that I just can't imagine is true

1689
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
There's also a

1690
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:16,895
Just want to highlight

1691
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
Contractor

1692
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
In the media

1693
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
The area media

1694
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
At JPL

1695
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
Oceanlab

1696
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,855
And there's a very old

1697
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Fashion

1698
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Phone system

1699
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Damn that I became aware

1700
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
At that they keep

1701
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
Operation

1702
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
And obvious

1703
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
Actually this is Angela

1704
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Basically

1705
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
I guess in

1706
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,031
I don't think I believe Carrie worked even as a contractor for the jet propulsion Laboratory

1707
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:50,687
Since 1958 JPL has been owned and operated by NASA so at any point that she could have possibly been there

1708
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
I should have been employed by NASA

1709
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,319
I find this difficult to believe but then again a lot of really strange contract

1710
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
Deployment does happen

1711
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,879
Yeah

1712
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
It's not in

1713
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,439
Possible to me but

1714
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Is weird

1715
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
Cadillac

1716
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
I don't like it

1717
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
I don't I don't buy it I don't buy it but

1718
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,399
It does have the sound of like such a tossed off

1719
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Fact

1720
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
But there's something behind

1721
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,799
I feel like you would come up a lot more in the past

1722
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:21,151
Another reason I find this hard to believe is the JPL offers a ton of fellowships

1723
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,711
Internships for students looking to build up their resume

1724
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,807
Given that it's actually also part of the California Institute of Technology

1725
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,415
I would assume that whatever media contract work they would have like iron

1726
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,231
Carrie for could have easily been handled by a Caltech student

1727
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
I have no idea

1728
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:40,863
I'd be interested to know more about her supposed entry and that in this resume

1729
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:46,239
Even if she did contract there for a bit I have no reason to believe that I gave her access to any inside information

1730
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
Princeton

1731
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
That little bit of trivia about the phone

1732
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,615
She could have easily gotten that from a tour of the

1733
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
The facility which are offered to folks who make reservations or 41 what they used to hold open houses on a regular basis

1734
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,039
Maybe she means she gave

1735
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
Tours

1736
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
No

1737
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,623
I doubt it okay

1738
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Intuit like Imports

1739
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,231
She saying about them using an old phone system is even accurate

1740
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,815
There are other explanations for what that why that would be the case are Jews are getting it

1741
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
Can AI take over the Sarah Fredo

1742
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:18,495
But what about the idea that like there might be areas of the lab that are engaged in very precise measurement

1743
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:22,591
Nancy could be thrown off by electronic signatures from mobile phones or Wireless signal

1744
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
I have no idea if that is the case

1745
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
But off the top my head

1746
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:32,319
It's possible explanation for why a super high-tech lab might rely on low-tech strategies for phone

1747
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
Obviously it's it's

1748
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,647
Completely conceivable

1749
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
The direct line to Batman

1750
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Now

1751
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,279
We get into weird Theory

1752
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,631
This ends up being a rationalization for why Trump is closing

1753
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
On the Border

1754
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
Border

1755
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,263
We've heard her talk about this before

1756
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,079
This is not a completely fresh.

1757
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
That she has

1758
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,919
But it's fleshed-out in a way that is a little bit

1759
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
The

1760
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
More full then we've heard

1761
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
So the gray human hybrid

1762
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Program

1763
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,831
People that wanted me

1764
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,599
Me to ask Mark

1765
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
More about this so I

1766
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
I did talk to her

1767
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,231
Obviously they're gonna

1768
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
Has made a deal

1769
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
With Grace

1770
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
God

1771
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
Having to do with it

1772
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
Exchange of Technology this goes by

1773
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
The days of ice

1774
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
And how horrendous

1775
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
Is very well-known

1776
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,471
Coerced by people

1777
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,519
Sceptre Roswell

1778
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,799
Now there

1779
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,591
Was a deal also made

1780
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
To get them to

1781
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
Stop abducting us

1782
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
A citizen

1783
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
And to focus on

1784
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
South of the Border

1785
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
That indie

1786
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
Is what happened

1787
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,319
The greys

1788
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,343
Happen

1789
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Much more Act

1790
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Abducting

1791
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
Frozen Latin and South

1792
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
America

1793
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
As a result

1794
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,279
Over the past

1795
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
60 years

1796
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
And this is really white

1797
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:50,911
Close the border

1798
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
It has to do with

1799
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Those hybrids

1800
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Coming of age

1801
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
So those are

1802
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Great human hybrids

1803
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
And

1804
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,103
That was a very sick

1805
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
The program

1806
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
Are the greys

1807
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
And a lot of

1808
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
Come Back Inn

1809
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
States

1810
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
And this

1811
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Is creating

1812
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:09,855
Kind of annex

1813
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
Scenario

1814
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
Having to do with

1815
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
With a population

1816
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:19,327
Control all this is creating a narrative where it becomes the most

1817
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
Smelly acceptable for you to accept

1818
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,911
Brutal policing

1819
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
On

1820
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:27,007
Vulnerable populations that are coming up from

1821
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,847
South of the Border is all just a

1822
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,127
Outrageous

1823
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,199
Fantasy version of why I like

1824
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:40,831
Yeah of course we should put people in cages of course Batman kill them if you need to get her superpowers

1825
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,415
Their super-powered understand like this could be a

1826
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,231
Cyclops with no mask situation

1827
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,303
Very easily allow it to be

1828
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,143
What if what if one of them is able to explode

1829
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,239
What are what are we doing I just don't know.

1830
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
I mean

1831
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,335
You know I think a lot of genocides where X-Men based

1832
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,359
Honestly I

1833
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Personally that's

1834
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:08,991
Why genocides tend to ikaria

1835
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:15,391
Yeah everytime they pop up this is all just to create emotional distance between

1836
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,463
Green people that are unlike yourself it's shity

1837
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,999
It's really really

1838
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
I'd like to say this

1839
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
I understood

1840
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,399
That according to Paranormal lower

1841
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:30,751
Eisenhower signed a contract with aliens do you know that has to do with a doctor

1842
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:37,151
Is apart of the Canon

1843
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:43,551
Do people in Central South America and if so I would like to say I don't like Ike

1844
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,183
That's really shity

1845
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,719
Really that's

1846
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:55,327
American foreign policy in Dutch

1847
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,375
Just don't want to know how sweet

1848
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,911
Go f*** with them

1849
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Horrible

1850
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
Training with the

1851
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,007
How can you make a treaty

1852
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
With them

1853
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,359
For another Nation to be

1854
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Ransack

1855
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,991
Like aren't we really that's not even a treaty isn't he just being like a

1856
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,295
Look at those guys over there why don't you do those guys

1857
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,367
Right that's bad that's real bad

1858
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,439
We're on his part and also carry is being

1859
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:28,095
Quite frankly that's all that really boils down to it's just a rationalization and I mean

1860
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,703
I guess it's probably more fun to tell yourself

1861
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:36,287
But that's like what you're afraid of

1862
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,335
Hey hey

1863
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:42,431
Different skin than me I'm not worried about them

1864
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
X-Men

1865
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
Is that

1866
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:50,623
The problem is there's going to be an invasion at the border

1867
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
And

1868
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:57,535
It might not be immigrants from the the South and we know that this is going to happen

1869
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,327
Mainecare explains why

1870
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
He has it on really good authority alright

1871
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
There is also still the risk

1872
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:04,959
Chinese info

1873
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
Filtration through our border

1874
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
Underground

1875
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
Of that border

1876
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
And I've actually had

1877
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
A very

1878
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
Dream

1879
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,199
And I certainly hope does

1880
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
I'm true that it does

1881
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,575
Border I didn't know you had a dream

1882
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,367
Well that's all that mean

1883
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:27,487
Now that I know that I've got dream behind me I add there's just nothing I do know that she's psychic

1884
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
We

1885
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:34,399
Is not good check is going to invade with X-Men

1886
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
She's on Trump side

1887
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Yeah

1888
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,543
Did she not know who the bad guy in X-Men was

1889
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
She what

1890
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:49,247
But that's that's how they that's how the movie got made

1891
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
Emsam

1892
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,343
It's Pro X-Men propaganda from the Chinese

1893
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,159
Exactly

1894
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:01,023
This is also also

1895
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,583
No doubt also

1896
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
Important point

1897
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,423
I don't know what superpowers are being created

1898
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,447
Down there

1899
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
But

1900
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,567
Every single X-Men movie I've ever seen

1901
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,152
Every single EX man and woman

1902
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
Can handle a wall

1903
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,184
There's that one guy the guy who was kept in in that little roof

1904
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,768
X-Men the Last Stand the one who cured other mutants of their mutinous

1905
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:37,376
Magneto Magneto f**** up walls

1906
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:46,848
90% of X-Men characters would have no problem with the wall Nightcrawler can crawl right over it

1907
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:52,224
Most of them can fly people can walk through walls

1908
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,576
Juggernaut just run through

1909
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:05,280
But then you reveal yourself to the greater population so it makes more sense to just acquiesce to your

1910
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
Horrific treatment

1911
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,840
I don't know

1912
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
Okay

1913
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,936
Still going to have a problem with the teleporter

1914
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,496
Well that working for the Draco

1915
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:21,920
If you can teleport you get you get Lieutenant Colonel status love the idea that you're trying to

1916
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,760
To create this exaggerated and your solution is a f****** wall

1917
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,600
We got super

1918
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Human

1919
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,416
Campbell wall

1920
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:36,512
No matter what every one she likes is incompetent any story

1921
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,328
F****** humans can climb these walls overfill

1922
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,376
Not superpower people

1923
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,752
Dumb dumb

1924
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Betty White

1925
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
You were touching on

1926
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,592
Some of the

1927
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,456
Let's call it subtle racism

1928
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Well

1929
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,296
Compared to this next clip what you said earlier was

1930
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
Not-so-subtle

1931
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:05,440
Also involves her believing that the movie Logan is real we have

1932
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,792
The great movie has said that it's real before so that part not shocking

1933
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Although the book comes after it

1934
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Barry rice

1935
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
Again the gray

1936
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
To the Reps

1937
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,704
Or to the Draco

1938
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,240
There's an important

1939
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
Story

1940
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
Sort of story

1941
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
I'm talking about

1942
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
Has to do with an X

1943
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
X-Men movie called

1944
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
Logan

1945
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
I highly recommended

1946
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
If you haven't seen it

1947
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Scary movie

1948
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,528
Latinos

1949
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
South America

1950
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,344
Are closer

1951
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,392
2 as of what you call a route race

1952
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
Closer to the root race

1953
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
And therefore

1954
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
They are

1955
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
A better genetic

1956
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,304
Sort of basis

1957
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,096
Or more fertile ground

1958
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
4

1959
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
For the

1960
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
Invasion

1961
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Have the gray

1962
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
Genetics

1963
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
And

1964
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
And

1965
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
You know when you do

1966
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,360
Hybridization

1967
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,176
Is no new need a very sturdy

1968
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,968
Rootstock

1969
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,248
And so this is

1970
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
Is why they

1971
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
They

1972
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
It in that area

1973
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
I and

1974
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Meaning strong enough

1975
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
To handle

1976
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
Without dying

1977
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
The grey

1978
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,512
That's that's

1979
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Going on there

1980
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Wow

1981
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,400
You know what this

1982
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
This is

1983
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,984
Proof of how equal our society

1984
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,616
In the in the early 1800s in the early 1800s this is

1985
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,920
Is the type of s*** that doctors would say about

1986
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,992
And now here we are a woman is

1987
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:37,600
Strong enough to paint an entire race of people with one big broad brush

1988
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,392
We've always dreamt

1989
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:42,208
Quality that's racist bulshit

1990
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
Equality

1991
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,024
Okay

1992
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,048
I mean you could

1993
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,328
You could

1994
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,376
Kind of make the argument

1995
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:52,704
That closer to the root race

1996
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,240
That's a phrasing

1997
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,568
Might be equivalent to an evolved

1998
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:09,344
I can't even get it like it this is I don't know what that means, CLE

1999
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,672
I don't know how you can say that out loud and be like no I'm not being racist

2000
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:18,048
Because actually being complimentary

2001
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:22,656
They're so much better than because this classification of people is

2002
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
Different than

2003
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,728
White people

2004
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:30,592
Yeah they're not as far along the path right makes them easier

2005
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
4

2006
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,432
Aliens to hybridize

2007
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:40,832
Obviously we'll just fall apart at the drop of a hat have you seen

2008
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
On the beach

2009
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,672
We get off work

2010
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:53,376
I really just don't understand people who insist they understand anything about June

2011
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:57,728
Genetics while at the same time looking at somebody thinking skin color means jeans are completely

2012
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:06,176
Yours going to different color than mine so obviously you're from a completely different route race stock

2013
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
Yeah Cheese's

2014
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,480
Christ

2015
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,528
Knock knock

2016
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Barry rice

2017
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,672
Glad that you watch the Logan though

2018
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,488
Yeah

2019
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,536
Good movie

2020
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
Turns out Mark

2021
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
Add a option

2022
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:28,192
That he faced in his life and that was the possibility to become more than

2023
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:30,240
Human himself

2024
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,776
Twisted offer die

2025
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,312
Raptor enhancement

2026
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
And

2027
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
It's a piece of raptor brain that

2028
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Would have been merged

2029
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
But he

2030
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Raptor

2031
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,368
Rappers at Branson hotels right even though he works

2032
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
The Raptors

2033
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
And they are on

2034
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
Humanity

2035
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Time

2036
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,816
I don't like the app

2037
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
The blossom

2038
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
Raptors that's

2039
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
Depicts in

2040
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,936
The Jurassic

2041
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
World in

2042
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,496
Jurassic movies

2043
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:10,176
Exacerbated by constantly getting the quest the Raptors

2044
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456
I mean

2045
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:17,600
And they don't have they don't have feathers so don't even get me started on that whole thing

2046
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:24,000
Ask Mark Richards about the feathers I've never heard of Chinamen on that that's a good point that's a good point I would really settle that for once and for all

2047
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,816
Feathers no feathers

2048
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
Walmart

2049
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
I need to know

2050
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,424
Yeah so I guess it means like

2051
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,520
Hey I respect anyone's decision whether or not to become part Raptor

2052
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
But it seems weird

2053
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:43,200
Wow yeah he would've been disqualified from the Olympics so you won't even become part wrapping

2054
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,760
Buser

2055
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:50,112
So we hid now to the question of the 2020 election here

2056
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,648
And Marquette

2057
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,928
Jim Carrey have some

2058
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,952
Great thought

2059
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:57,280
Interesting analysis that Mark thinks that Trump will win

2060
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
Which I think a lot of people are

2061
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,864
Concerned about right

2062
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
So regarding

2063
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,424
Trump and another

2064
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
Are term he does

2065
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Believe that

2066
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
Have another term

2067
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
He says the people running

2068
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
The Democratic

2069
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Side

2070
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,872
Those running

2071
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
Iowa caucus

2072
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
Was proof that the

2073
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
12

2074
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,856
But they are not going to allow any of those running

2075
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Seed

2076
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Corsage

2077
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Elections

2078
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:27,744
Time

2079
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,024
Forever

2080
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,304
Especially

2081
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,352
Kennedy

2082
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
So from then on

2083
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
Pre-election

2084
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
Wilson

2085
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,544
Leonardo Lincoln

2086
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,944
No certainly not even for that but he did bring in the Federal Reserve what you would think

2087
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:53,344
Draco would be into according to the transitive property

2088
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,440
Yeah

2089
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
Cool

2090
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Alright

2091
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,280
I'm telling you Marques not bring it

2092
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,864
This is a lazy tag party sucks

2093
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,424
Good call Mark I will I will save it from

2094
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,752
By experience of watching it I did also feel like

2095
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:15,872
There's a much less marking this big normal.

2096
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,944
And he needed to flush it out a little

2097
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,248
So we get now to talkin about

2098
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,320
Listen to this and tell me this isn't just

2099
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,600
Exactly Alec

2100
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
However

2101
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160
What happened with

2102
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
Trump and Ivana

2103
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,464
This many times

2104
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Been a hack

2105
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,024
Talking back

2106
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,048
From the Hillary

2107
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,888
Of the elect

2108
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
So that's

2109
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
How I

2110
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,704
Trump came

2111
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Manpower

2112
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
Impact by

2113
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:50,688
Open back by certain personal calendar and hacking back a counter to the counter

2114
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
This narrative runs

2115
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
Through of

2116
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,088
Many different communities they're all

2117
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,672
Convinced of this idea that all elections are controlled

2118
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,768
But Trump isn't because he's working with the good guys and Ray

2119
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
Mysterious secrets

2120
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,120
Space Program deep State whatever the f***

2121
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
In a counter-coup against

2122
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,448
The coup that Hillary was running

2123
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,496
All its Universal

2124
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Weird

2125
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
Scenario back to Knicks

2126
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,432
That's something that I was expecting you to say

2127
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,736
The Nixon get a very particular

2128
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,296
Either job in the Eisenhower Administration

2129
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
Okay

2130
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,344
He handled the alien

2131
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,368
Yes you did a course

2132
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,160
Why did I do that

2133
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:37,280
Why was that tape turned off then we talked about the Cuban Missile Crisis again be

2134
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,304
Because I wanted to

2135
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
Get some clarification on

2136
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
The information we

2137
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
I gotten in the past

2138
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,216
From Mark regarding. And

2139
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,240
Nixon's role

2140
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
Exedra

2141
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
And

2142
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,848
Nixon obviously never got all over it

2143
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
And pee

2144
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,152
People are recommended

2145
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,432
To see the book by Ashton

2146
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,200
Greywater

2147
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,224
The hoax

2148
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
I will not

2149
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
And Nixon had

2150
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
Handled the e.t.

2151
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
Situation for Eisenhower

2152
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,624
And was red in

2153
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Nixon

2154
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,696
Was taken down through mine could

2155
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
Troll

2156
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
An operation

2157
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,512
In Orchestra

2158
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,280
Headed by

2159
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,560
These usually

2160
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,328
Usual Suspects

2161
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,352
Says I call them

2162
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,168
Jordan what's the glaring problem in this timeline

2163
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:17,984
God

2164
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:22,848
The Cuban Missile Crisis happened in October 1962 at which point Dixon was

2165
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:26,176
It's not an office nor was Eisenhower

2166
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,736
He was busy Nixon was he was running for

2167
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,040
The governor of California

2168
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
While he was still work

2169
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
With Kennedy

2170
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:37,440
Azalea it was not

2171
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
Heather I understand

2172
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,792
I know JFK one and Nixon was

2173
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,072
Absolutely furious with

2174
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:46,912
But when you get a chance to handle the aliens for the president of the United

2175
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
You got to do anyway

2176
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,752
Right

2177
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,568
In office

2178
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:58,176
Nixon was at Ryan's Cuban Missile Crisis happen how

2179
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
Couldn't get over that

2180
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
Right

2181
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,552
And then would become president years later

2182
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,088
And then was impeached

2183
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,112
Because of Mike

2184
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:06,880
Control

2185
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
This doesn't make

2186
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:13,280
I wrote down the question is she of Nixon fan and she answered it in that clip

2187
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,584
Vitamix an apologist at least

2188
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,400
They always support the bad guy does he

2189
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:23,264
Do they just not know when about like not super consist

2190
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,664
A lot of the folks who were in The Alex Jones the side of the right-wing and Alex prior to

2191
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,480
More recent history we're pretty not internet

2192
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,784
Nixon was not somebody who

2193
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,832
They consider like

2194
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,440
Someone in the Goldwater vain

2195
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
Well any help through open relations

2196
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,144
Alex is a little bit more money on that now because of

2197
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,544
Being friends with Rodgers certainly makes it difficult when your best friend has a tattoo of

2198
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,408
Nixon on his back

2199
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:06,784
But a lot of the folks like if you go back to like a John Birch Society folks a lot of them were very naughty

2200
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
Internet

2201
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
So

2202
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,136
Who carries angle on it is very strange

2203
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,720
I'm not sure I've ever heard the he was brought down by mind control Arkansas

2204
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:19,584
Appreciate on some level

2205
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,168
Could Nixon not get over the Cuban Missile Crisis which he wasn't

2206
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:28,544
I mean unless while he was running for governor of California

2207
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,104
He was somehow involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis

2208
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128
Maybe

2209
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:37,504
She answers that it's turns out it's her explanation for literally f****** everything

2210
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,296
Basically with regard to the

2211
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
Cuban missile

2212
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
Which

2213
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
Nixon never got over

2214
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
There were grave

2215
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
He's coming in

2216
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Interdimensional

2217
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Leave it had to be

2218
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Stop.

2219
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
Course

2220
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
They

2221
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
And Leash

2222
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Some very Horeb

2223
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Stop

2224
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
He said the graves were involved

2225
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,216
Totally in that

2226
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Crisis that it

2227
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,264
Was not about

2228
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
People thought it was

2229
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
Russian missile

2230
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,664
That was

2231
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:12,320
A cover is always a Stargate going on everywhere there's aliens coming in and you just see it like

2232
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
Sure you think

2233
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:18,208
So you know brinkmanship between world superpower

2234
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
That's not it's aliens

2235
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
You know

2236
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
Always

2237
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,048
Always

2238
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
Always

2239
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Mark

2240
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Does not like

2241
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:30,752
Immigrants so much he will rewrite history to always be about somebody coming into this country

2242
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
Yeah

2243
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,128
He hates immigrants

2244
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,176
It's painfully consistent

2245
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,224
Every time there is something

2246
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
And I like the first Iraq War

2247
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:48,160
Saddam Hussein was trying to bring an alien through a portal every single thing

2248
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,232
It's not as aliens in the portals

2249
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
Covenant through a portal

2250
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,584
Every single f****** time it's aliens in a portal

2251
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,400
And it turns out those fires

2252
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:02,240
And not Brazil

2253
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,776
It's definitely about alien okay

2254
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,312
He talked about

2255
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
The jungles

2256
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
In South America

2257
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
Rock'n Africa saying that

2258
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,408
The grayscale

2259
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
Considered

2260
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
Jungles

2261
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Huron

2262
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
Planet Earth as dangerous

2263
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,040
REI

2264
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,112
Now that's what I was looking for

2265
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
Life-form

2266
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,696
So that

2267
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,720
They consider

2268
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
South America

2269
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,280
More friendly environment

2270
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,096
And the deforestation in the fires in

2271
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
In the Amazon

2272
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
Get more candy

2273
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
I live there

2274
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
Does light bugs

2275
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:39,616
He's projecting all of his hatred go to the Grave

2276
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,200
By Grace afraid of jungles

2277
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,528
They would be afraid of CDs to then cuz to them

2278
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,832
Everything is for urban jungle

2279
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,184
If they prefer

2280
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,512
Planes dad temperate Plains they want to live

2281
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,536
In Iowa

2282
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:03,936
If gray aliens are afraid of jungles because of their being a bunch of things there

2283
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Date of every

2284
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Right

2285
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,264
Everyday will be afraid of human

2286
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,800
Afraid of cows

2287
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,664
Is exhausting

2288
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,968
It's like I was like

2289
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,504
It's like War of the Worlds

2290
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,088
Bailey's weren't afraid of us but they should have been afraid of the

2291
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:27,488
Cold I grow weary of this

2292
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,584
What we need to do to stop them is either or

2293
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:38,496
Turn the entire Earth into a jungle now see this is one of those interesting instances where the fantasy scenario actually come

2294
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Kind of works

2295
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,128
Towards the right goal because his right

2296
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:49,760
She should be opposed to the deforestation and the burning of the forest because she's afraid that

2297
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:56,160
Razor trying to hang out without the bug is the business interests that are behind before

2298
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:02,560
PlayStation be opposed to the Amazon disappearing

2299
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,888
Isn't it this is an instance of like if that's how you get there that's how you get there

2300
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:11,264
I'm not going to argue with you we'll deal with that later

2301
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,360
But the other is not so much they cannot agree with

2302
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,152
The conclusion

2303
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,456
That's why I'll just go ahead and

2304
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,272
I do appreciate knowing that

2305
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
I am part of the

2306
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
The human race

2307
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
Which is not responsible for

2308
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,136
Anyting

2309
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:27,904
Ever

2310
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,488
In our entire history portal that always been aliens

2311
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:37,888
Last time we talked about

2312
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
Lackadaisical

2313
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,960
Lackluster superpower which is

2314
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:49,408
Sort of tell you where portals might be an expression of the superpower

2315
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,456
So there is also information

2316
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
That

2317
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,016
I gave two

2318
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
Because we

2319
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
When we

2320
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
I come to visit

2321
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,112
Mark I Stay

2322
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
In San Francisco

2323
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
And

2324
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,720
The Tourist

2325
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
For the day before

2326
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,280
And

2327
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,816
In this case we stayed

2328
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
Fisherman

2329
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
It's worth

2330
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,888
Fisherman's Wharf in San Fran

2331
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
Cisco sbk

2332
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Highly Dane

2333
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Late at night

2334
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
No it's very nice

2335
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
Near the public

2336
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,312
Iowa

2337
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,848
Basically bringing that

2338
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Attention because

2339
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
Is pots

2340
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,200
That there is a

2341
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
The portal there

2342
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,736
That has

2343
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:30,624
Oh no Fisherman Wharf is basically the biggest tourist center in San Francisco

2344
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,440
Everything there is just like super tour eccentric

2345
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:38,304
I've been there a bunch of times since my grandma lived in the Bay Area and one thing I will say

2346
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,864
Is that's kind of working in Kerry's favor

2347
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
Is it fishing

2348
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:48,800
Dwarf does how's the original Ghirardelli chocolate plant anywhere

2349
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Cracked

2350
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
Right

2351
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:58,272
I've done it all the Fisherman's Wharf man I've been to the Chocolate Factory of gone to the cable car museum of going to Pier 39

2352
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
And I've never seen

2353
01:37:59,296 --> 01:37:59,808
An alien

2354
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:06,464
Last year did see a slight uptick in violent crime in the neighborhood however with a man being murdered there in March

2355
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,280
2019 and there been some robberies that have been reported

2356
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,864
The murder does appear to have been a fight between people who at least

2357
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
Kind of acquainted with each other it's very weird

2358
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
The details are able to find about that

2359
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:20,032
If you know some robberies are going to take place

2360
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,104
In any area where there's a high concentration of people so it's not

2361
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,456
Yo it's obviously not good but I don't think you should look at

2362
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,760
The robberies and be like

2363
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,576
Oh my God everything is deteriorating probably a portal

2364
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,416
Last month a group of eight women attacked a sixteen-year-old Starbucks

2365
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:40,512
Employee with a golf club and stole her watching phone and it completely bizarre crime

2366
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:47,424
Despite this I can find no indication of Fisherman's Wharf being any more or less dangerous than any big city tourist area after.

2367
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,216
If I had to guess

2368
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:55,616
I'm betting the Carrie saw a high proportion of Hispanic people walking around because she knows they're closer to the brute race

2369
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,920
And that's more likely to be alien hybrids

2370
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
She got freaked out

2371
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,760
That's kind of nice

2372
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,064
She just like summed up white

2373
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,088
Flight into second

2374
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,648
She was like well it's probably a portal

2375
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,440
It's dangerous after dark now you

2376
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
Right

2377
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:16,864
So I also we get to from Mark and explanation of the assassination of qasem soleimani

2378
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,400
I was wondering why that

2379
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
Wow turns out

2380
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Regarding the death of

2381
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Solomanie

2382
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
He said he was

2383
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,776
Just trying to access

2384
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
The gates between

2385
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
Between around and Rock

2386
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,592
And give

2387
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Accessed

2388
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,128
Ascertain being

2389
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
Who wanted to

2390
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
To come into this

2391
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
This dimension

2392
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
The real this is

2393
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,272
The real reason he had

2394
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,040
Did I

2395
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,064
He basically wanted

2396
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,344
Andrew Lauren

2397
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,624
And to let

2398
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,392
The real

2399
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
In just as sad

2400
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:41,952
Hussein

2401
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
Deposed

2402
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,072
Sodom was letting in

2403
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,608
Anunnaki

2404
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,680
Beings.

2405
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,752
Be allowed

2406
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
It's all portals van

2407
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:56,800
Mark

2408
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,336
Does not know who soleimani

2409
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:05,248
I'm guessing he was bluffing around. All is not very creative

2410
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:10,624
On one level is in their particular picadillos like the antiquing

2411
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,440
With Raptors on the archaeology with cats

2412
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,024
Because I think something that's pretty f****** hilarious because

2413
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,096
Like obviously the cat one is cuz of litter boxes

2414
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
Like

2415
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,912
Digging around for artifact

2416
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:27,520
I think they're so fun creativity there but he's not very creative when it comes to

2417
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,800
The geopolitical explanation

2418
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,360
Everything is aliens coming through a portal

2419
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:35,200
Qassamsoleimani is assassinated it's like wow that's weird why would Trump

2420
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,480
Do something like that

2421
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:40,576
I'd like wild course he was trying to create a portal to let aliens in

2422
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:44,160
And the iraq-iran thing and it wasn't a petulant man-baby lashing out

2423
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,208
And we all know that that's a

2424
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
Reasonable

2425
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:53,632
Valid argument to make because that's what happened with Saddam Hussein to all of this

2426
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,680
Exhaust

2427
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,104
So that we get an update on another figure in the world of Project Camelot that is Sean David Morton who is the sky

2428
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,712
Gamer Who Lies through the Prada to bunch of people didn't pay a Texas prison

2429
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,760
He's not having a good

2430
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,552
Sean David Morton

2431
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,832
Regarding

2432
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
His books and

2433
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,624
Time series

2434
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
And the fact that she

2435
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
In prison

2436
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
He's in

2437
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
In Texas now

2438
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Misprision

2439
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
And

2440
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
He has been

2441
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,400
As I say tortured

2442
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:32,800
I don't believe this but just to be fair I'm going to say if he is being tortured I wholeheartedly and

2443
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:35,104
Unqualifiedly against that

2444
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
I don't believe

2445
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:41,504
If it is please file a report with like the human rights people

2446
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Don't just try and

2447
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:47,904
Do whatever you're doing on your YouTube channel

2448
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,184
It's a big

2449
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,232
Torture is not that big of a problem

2450
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:56,352
I guess it's like it's part of the part of the game and it's very strange

2451
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,376
You're going to be torch

2452
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,912
I think that like

2453
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:02,752
It's the trivializes the idea of someone actually being tortured absolutely

2454
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:07,104
You should be contacting the UN or something like if you're if you actually

2455
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,408
Have some evidence that your scam friend

2456
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,944
Is pain torture to prison

2457
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,760
But there's a reason and Mark explains why

2458
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
Die

2459
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
Sean is getting

2460
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
Mistreatment

2461
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,856
And I talked to Mark about why she

2462
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,160
Orchard and

2463
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,696
He says they may have been

2464
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:22,720
They try to kill him

2465
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
Obviously they're trying to

2466
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
To get at

2467
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,304
The witness

2468
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
Testimony

2469
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,888
That was given to Sean

2470
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,912
And by his lawyer

2471
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:31,936
Through

2472
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:32,960
Other lawyer

2473
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:33,728
Are of an

2474
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Ran

2475
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Area

2476
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,288
51

2477
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,312
S4

2478
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,128
And that's why I should have paid him a time

2479
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,432
And

2480
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
I guess

2481
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:44,992
.

2482
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
That ended

2483
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,136
Doing a good job of it

2484
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:52,928
Degrees

2485
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:59,328
So you got a situation where there's a guy who used to run Area 51 and then became a time traveler and he's

2486
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
Giving this information that Sean David Morton

2487
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:05,728
Uses Derita Sands of Time book rights Sean's been arrested for his

2488
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,520
Rampant crime

2489
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:10,848
Well and now he's being tortured in prison in Mark believes that

2490
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:15,456
It's because they're trying to get at this whistleblower guy who's the source for the sands of time

2491
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,016
Become a time traveler

2492
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:22,368
There's a problem or before there's a there's a problem.

2493
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,160
And that is that.

2494
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,744
Let me read to you from the introduction of the first Sands of Time book

2495
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,840
Many years ago a powerful mysterious man approached the author

2496
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:38,240
He lives virtually all his life is a top director in high-level scientist involved in the above-top-secret black world of Shadowgun

2497
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,776
Everman projects and research

2498
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:44,896
He said he admired the service of the author and is undaunted quest to bring the truth to light

2499
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,224
It began a feed of crucial inside information to be released to the public

2500
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:54,624
He's a hero when certain circumstances presented themselves he wanted to get the truth out to the world before it was too late as our planet was

2501
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,416
Iggy said in grave Danger

2502
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,768
But he could only tell the whole story after he had moved on to use his exact words

2503
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:05,632
The government doesn't need to torture Sean to get his whistleblower because Sean Zone narrative

2504
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,168
According to that dude that

2505
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,216
He could only get the information

2506
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
After the dude was dead

2507
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,800
Cuz John only got this from his estate

2508
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,360
When it was being sorted out after he died

2509
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:19,968
Like I understand that you could be like I've removed on means he time traveled or something

2510
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,992
But he died

2511
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,296
According to Shawn's narrative dudes death

2512
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,576
Sean himself

2513
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:28,416
Yes I do today at the introduction of his book you can't change the story now

2514
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,232
Internal consistency is pretty important when you're just making up

2515
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:34,048
Conspiracy bowls

2516
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,888
So anyway Mark believes something is going

2517
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,936
Mark said

2518
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
He read Acts

2519
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,520
And that

2520
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,056
They contain Bop-It biking

2521
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
And

2522
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,128
Basically they

2523
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
Maybe trying

2524
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,432
Persuasion

2525
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Discredit him.

2526
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
Before there were they

2527
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,928
If that's the case you should be out already cuz mission accomplished that dude

2528
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:05,792
Did it before you went into prison

2529
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:10,656
One last clip might down for this because it's a hit you with some whiplash

2530
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,472
It starts with a

2531
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
Sort of

2532
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,032
Standard complaint

2533
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,080
Of the Paranormal conspiracy world

2534
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:21,664
And then a nonsensical thing

2535
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,456
PennDOT problem with humans

2536
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,992
Is that they're not waking up

2537
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
Not fast enough

2538
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
According to mark

2539
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,320
And

2540
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,856
She says that they are going to

2541
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Sure what's coming

2542
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
Lie down in the

2543
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,464
Wake up

2544
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,768
And lastly regarding

2545
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,792
Trump's family

2546
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,072
Mark says he

2547
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
He believes the women in

2548
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Family

2549
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
Are knocking

2550
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:44,960
And that was

2551
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,752
Basically I think that's my last

2552
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,824
And and so that is

2553
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,592
That's it

2554
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
For the mark Richards

2555
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
Total Recall

2556
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,456
Okay

2557
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,736
No further comment

2558
01:45:56,992 --> 01:46:03,136
I do believe they're human call say on the matter if you're all going to be Dukes

2559
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:06,720
Future also

2560
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Not human

2561
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,096
No likes

2562
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:15,680
They're good aliens bad aliens are Draco they're not there just

2563
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:22,336
Not well we know that Carrie has previously said that she believes or she's been told

2564
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,128
Older Mark maybe even said

2565
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,408
That Melania is a

2566
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:28,992
The conduit by which aliens communicate with the trunk

2567
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,040
But Mark wouldn't tell her what

2568
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,880
Species of alien is contacting her which is not good

2569
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:41,280
We don't even get any implication of clearly didn't tell her what aliens Ivanka

2570
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,048
It's not important

2571
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
Ivanka and

2572
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,120
Does this mean

2573
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:47,168
Did Melania is an alien

2574
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:47,936
Trump

2575
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:50,496
Wait but Ivanka isn't melania's daughter

2576
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:54,592
Nope nothing has been f****** alien since the beginning

2577
01:46:54,848 --> 01:47:00,992
Every woman in Trump's family is an alien

2578
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,320
Why isn't Trump an alien that are Trump's Mom an alien

2579
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,600
I don't know man

2580
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:12,000
We got to find this out this is this is a case that I am not going to crack

2581
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:18,400
You got to get to the bottom of this. All right suck it Monday I'm not going back to Alex get to the bottom of this

2582
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:25,312
Family women are aliens

2583
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:29,152
An alien to then right is Barron is melania's

2584
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,480
The women aren't human

2585
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,808
I don't get quiet I realize I don't care

2586
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,600
Yeah you know you think so

2587
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
Right

2588
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,696
So we come to the end of this and I think there's some

2589
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,232
Fun stupidity

2590
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,304
Fun nonsense here and I've enjoyed

2591
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
This little lie

2592
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,144
Dial before we get down to

2593
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,448
On the next episode just getting

2594
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984
Right back down to business

2595
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,544
Over Monday on the Alex Jones

2596
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,568
Present-day stop

2597
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:02,432
But I think even though we try and take these breaks and we try and look at these

2598
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,480
Completely non real world things

2599
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,504
And you just see

2600
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,040
These shocking overlay

2601
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,320
Parallels

2602
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,112
Between the what underpin

2603
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,136
Interworld

2604
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,416
And what underpins Alex

2605
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
It's and it's

2606
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:20,352
I mean if you don't see the similarities between the two in the ways in which they sort of guide you towards

2607
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,400
Similar bad conclusions

2608
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,192
Then

2609
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
I don't know

2610
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,752
I don't know what to tell you

2611
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:28,288
I just

2612
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:29,824
I think

2613
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,872
She thinks it's a good thing

2614
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,640
But

2615
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:35,200
This entire episode seems like she is

2616
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,736
Sweetly dehumanizing

2617
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
Everything

2618
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Like

2619
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:45,440
Just people who deal with coronavirus South America

2620
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:50,048
Fallout people in the Amazon are being affected by the fires before station

2621
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,584
None of that

2622
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,192
None of that matters know people matter none of these nobody is a

2623
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
Player in the game

2624
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:02,592
The Chinese aren't players in the game it's all the Draco in their reptilian Buddies

2625
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,688
Like nobody is a person I think you like the

2626
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,224
Larger thing

2627
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,504
Is that

2628
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:14,880
These things work is their stories that are being told

2629
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:21,024
In order for you to not have to feel for the people who are affected in these circumstances

2630
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,632
There's a narrative it's being spun that's almost like an emotional weighted blanket

2631
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:32,032
Little comfort you instead of having to look at the fact that now there are a lot of things that are going on

2632
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:35,360
On that third week should be doing more about and

2633
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,896
For some reason

2634
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:40,224
We're either deer like in our duties or we're just not able

2635
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:40,992
02

2636
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,016
Deal with some

2637
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,552
Some things that are hurting

2638
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,088
It's really hard

2639
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
To know the

2640
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:46,880
The government is

2641
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,672
Is purposely trying to

2642
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
Deny water to

2643
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,792
Coming into the United States

2644
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
Undocumented

2645
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,912
And in order to kill them

2646
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,936
As a deterrent

2647
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,704
French for more people

2648
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,568
But what if they were

2649
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,848
Text Matt exactly

2650
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,920
Well if you and I

2651
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:16,320
You & I in a situation where the X-Men are real probably would feel that way it's f***** up

2652
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,368
It helps carry not to feel those

2653
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,416
Are very conflicted and

2654
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,720
And hard emotions and

2655
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:23,744
I guess

2656
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,560
If you need that crotch it's fine but

2657
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,120
Site

2658
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
F***** up right

2659
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:34,240
And rendlesham didn't happen it was a lighthouse

2660
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:37,056
And Mark Richards has some very middle-of-the-road political take

2661
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,384
Yes he's really got nothing

2662
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,016
He doesn't have any heat there man I just think you had an off-day happened that could be

2663
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,832
Crawford interview slump
