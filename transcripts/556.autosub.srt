00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,127
Record should show that I did follow the instructions

191
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
It's that important

192
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
Because there were further instruction

193
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
Convince you opened it up

194
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Down on the paper was written like

195
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Dan if you've made it this far you need to stop

196
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
Further was like damn you've stolen Jordans

197
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Andy at this point

198
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
I was just guilt isn't imaginary how ashamed I would be if I saw this

199
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
That was the best part the best part was I was like

200
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
God dammit

201
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
It seemed the second note

202
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
It would have been

203
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
Just he would have spent

204
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Today's thinking about

205
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
It's a test I didn't know I had passed

206
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
Oh that's great

207
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Fun

208
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,879
Insult do I think it was

209
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
Testing you pass it as a senior now was King Arthur

210
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Taken care of on our cell phones

211
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Curiosities

212
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
Jordan May 6th and 7th I should say that this

213
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Is

214
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
But little fun for me

215
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
I mean granted it is like I buy you brought up like

216
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Weirdest

217
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Fancy back bowls

218
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Whatever

219
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
But there's a specific in this episode that allowed

220
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
Me to take in a little bit and I enjoyed that

221
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
Today Show

222
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Jones

223
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
Might be able to use that truck in the future

224
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
With that one

225
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Alex is starting out May 6th

226
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
See if you can think of a children's story

227
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
It comes to mind when you hear this

228
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
The information I got before the broadcast started

229
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Tours of top scientists and other major study

230
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
Read study from an extremely

231
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Prestigious

232
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Power Research Institute

233
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,487
And the University of Texas Galveston with a level 4 bioweapons research

234
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
I was completely blown away

235
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
I have trouble even being on air

236
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
This audience has millions of people urine

237
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
Credible crossword

238
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
If I said I have total proof

239
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
That they knew

240
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
Covid-19 vaccine

241
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
Virus Vector delivery system

242
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
The Pfizer mRNA and then the AstraZeneca

243
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
Juniper classes

244
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
In the main literature

245
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,471
Yams that it causes massive autoimmune response in the brain

246
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
And in the cardiovascular system

247
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
And they recommended.

248
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
I'll be done because it caused massive death in the lab animals

249
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
I had that info

250
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
Lost in the background noise

251
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,183
Instead all this Saturday I'm going to a special show

252
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
For 3 hours commercial-free everybody TuneIn

253
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
We would have millions and millions of people that tune

254
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Specifically

255
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
For that information

256
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Very seriously

257
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
There was a restaurant waiting for me

258
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,383
Fanfiction with others

259
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Mentally

260
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,063
We are also incredibly influential

261
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
This is

262
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
At this point

263
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
I can probably just go off air

264
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
And or have her come in and do a great job posting

265
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
And just go show this document

266
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
Yeah it so I just keep hearing the boy who cried wolf

267
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
This is a guy who

268
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
I have said that I have

269
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
Every problem too many times and now it's

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Just background

271
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
Can't really do this not really doing it and now the only way for me to escalate things

272
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,391
Show on my day off cuz that makes it look like I'm serious

273
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,463
Diminishing returns

274
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:28,863
As if there was some sort of law that somebody wrote about diminishing return also I don't remember if I pulled a clip of this Butler

275
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:35,263
Later in the show so Alex is saying that he's going to have to come back on Saturday to cover this thing is mega bomb shelter

276
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,847
Can get attention I'm supposed

277
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
To take my daughter fishing

278
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
Anyway

279
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
This man is truly the tip

280
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
Details but he's more right than he usually is

281
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,887
Yeah here interesting this is a study about stars not Stars Cove too but

282
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
In terms of the level I'm used to him making things up I was surprised

283
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
In the study and see this

284
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
In the conclusion sex

285
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,431
Quote these Stars Cove vaccines all induced antibody and protection against

286
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Affection with stars Coronavirus

287
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
However

288
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,831
Challenge of mice giving any of the vaccines led to occurrences of

289
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Th2 type

290
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Immuno pathology suggest

291
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Hypersensitivity

292
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Thesaurus coronavirus compound

293
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Was it induce

294
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
Caution and proceeding to application of SARS coronavirus vaccine in humans

295
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
He's indicated

296
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
That's pretty interesting and AutoZone it sounds pretty scary

297
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Like the idea of

298
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
Making a coronavirus vaccine

299
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Humans

300
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
He's something that shouldn't

301
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,335
Be done

302
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
But it's pretty important to recognize that

303
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
This is a part of medical literature

304
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
History

305
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
And that's not a static

306
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Yeah

307
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
This probably doesn't need to be said

308
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
But changes have been made

309
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
12

310
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
Additionally the circumstances were different with a worldwide outbreak happen

311
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Running now creating

312
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Necessity which

313
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Of course is the mother of invention

314
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Naturally

315
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,119
You can find some discussion of this very study Alex's referencing in more detailed write-ups about the path

316
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
The research is taken in terms of developing a coronavirus vaccine

317
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
Going through Sarah's Merced now SARS coronavirus 2

318
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,615
If Alex is just looking for flashy ways to smear science

319
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,479
He could find all sorts of studies from the past that have shown difficulties with vaccine development

320
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,599
That game relies on pretending the people don't learn from these studies and then adjust their approaches

321
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
One important thing to recognize

322
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Alex's referring to

323
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Which you can find by Googling the title

324
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,631
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immuno pathology

325
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
On challenge

326
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
With the SARS virus

327
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
Hobbit the title of

328
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
It's about

329
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Completely different vaccines than the ones that have

330
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Developed in response

331
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Covid

332
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,735
If you just read the first few pages of the study you see that the vaccines that were tested in this were two varieties

333
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
They were inactivated whole virus vaccines or virus like

334
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Particle Max

335
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
The visor in moderna vaccines RM RNA base vaccines which work entirely differently than either the types of his study

336
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,071
There's no direct relevance between the shots

337
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
And this study at all

338
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a viral Vector vaccine

339
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
Which is fairly similar to the virus-like particle approach

340
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
But with a very

341
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Important distinction

342
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
The virus-like particle vaccines in the study

343
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
The structural elements of stars devoid of any voice viral genomes

344
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
The trigger an immune response

345
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,319
The people where is the jnj vaccine uses

346
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
A non infectious virus

347
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
To create the spike protein of covid

348
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Which then teaches our body to recognize that's

349
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Incited

350
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
Pointier is it the Study Island

351
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Discovering is not a bombshell it does not require coming in on Saturday

352
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
If you don't

353
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Too much attention

354
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
You can kind of look like it supports its narrative

355
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Yeah but it's all bulshit

356
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
This

357
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
He's going to be one of the things that he talks about almost 6

358
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
Exclusively

359
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,551
Amazing

360
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
To see how

361
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Munchie just makes

362
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
She just making s*** up

363
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
It's amazing

364
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
I mean look

365
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Okay

366
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
You can tell me the challenges

367
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
And the things that were wrong

368
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
In 2012

369
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,167
Bright but if you tell me that they're the same now

370
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
How many iPhones was that ago

371
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
What was that for years

372
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
We're better than that now

373
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,967
People were still talking about the Mayan calendar

374
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,111
Fine okay don't tell me that in 2000 and 2012 they had trouble making a vaccine so

375
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
We should stop

376
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,975
There's a lot of variables that go into it and actually color of the

377
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Progression of

378
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
And some of that will discuss

379
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
A little bit later but look dude

380
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Alex found out about this

381
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
And he is

382
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Bucket

383
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Mad

384
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,079
This could save hundreds of millions of not billions of people

385
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
I thought it was over

386
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
For Humanity

387
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Again

388
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
I'm unable to continue the broadcast

389
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
I just can't do much this morning

390
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Controller

391
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Actress latest

392
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
Maybe

393
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Okay

394
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,295
Point that I suspected Alex was in a bad mood about something

395
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
Maybe something in his personal life was

396
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Not exactly to his liking

397
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,999
Why are so many people willing to follow somebody that publicly

398
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
It's like a whiny baby

399
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
What are you talkin

400
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Jordan

401
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Resist

402
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Jordan this isn't a drama

403
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,407
Someone brought this

404
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
And now everyone

405
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Got to die

406
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
I don't I just don't remember alive

407
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,439
Corvara in the middle of the Revolution to be like

408
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
I just don't even know

409
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:19,327
I just don't even care anymore I don't want to leave this revolution

410
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Quote Castro

411
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Wow

412
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Cheese's

413
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
So Alex wants

414
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
To protest

415
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
About this study man he wants to get out there and

416
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Like his routes

417
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Like

418
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Get back to Wookie was in Waco

419
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Life

420
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,503
That image of a guy driving around red in the face hero

421
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
There's no doubt about this is a maskil operation

422
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
No.

423
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
We should all go protest at

424
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Dell Children's Hospital

425
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
North Austin

426
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
What you do

427
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
W draw attention and bullhorn

428
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Prestigious

429
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,775
Bio weapons research lab saying any

430
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Maxine for the coronavirus family

431
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Autoimmune response

432
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Blood clots

433
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Look at this

434
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
They studied it on a whole bunch of animals

435
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
He killed Mass numbers on this

436
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,376
So there's some basic Alex's telling about the study just in that little ramp

437
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
Specific things you lying about you can see his motives

438
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Really clearly

439
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:35,616
The first thing to be very clear about is that this study only had to do with reactions to a vaccine advice

440
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:41,504
At the end of the study they even say quote limitations of the present studies include their performance in my only

441
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
And uncertainty of the relevance of rodent models to

442
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
To Saars coronavirus vaccines a human

443
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,184
Alex is skimming the study so he's only looking

444
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Give me the first page and abstract

445
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Basically

446
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
If you only look at that you don't actually read it

447
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
You might

448
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
Is there more animals involved

449
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,912
In the design section of the abstract

450
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
It says quote

451
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,520
For Kennedy vaccines for humans with or without Al imagine

452
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
We're at evaluated on a mouse model of SARS

453
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
And a VIP vaccine the vaccine given to ferrets

454
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
What's a non-human primate

455
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,040
Another whole virus vaccine and an rdna produced as

456
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Protein

457
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,856
Ferrets and non-human primates

458
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
Primates are reference

459
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
But not as participants in the study

460
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
The context of that is that vop vaccine

461
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
Are typically the type that are given to those animals

462
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
If you weren't paying

463
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,680
Attention to the study at all and you just wanted to use the appearance of it as a prop to scare people

464
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,288
If you really easy to see multiple animal names in the first page or just got to run with it cuz without

465
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,080
What is doing that like

466
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
12 Monkeys

467
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,200
Picture where there's all these animals in cages in like a dark lit there

468
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Somewhere yeah

469
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Second Alex is making up

470
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
Set the study showed that mass numbers of animals were killed because of the vaccine

471
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,160
Massive numbers of my Cymbalta begin with

472
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,208
And if you read the study you know how the

473
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Scotty was design

474
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
They vaccinated the mice with the different vaccines and 56

475
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,144
6 days later accident that's not entirely true

476
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
56 days into the study

477
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
5 MI

478
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
For me prove were killed to assess how well the vaccines at work

479
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
And 2 gauge long as you

480
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Exhausted

481
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,456
The remaining bison each group or challenge with live SARS and then killed two days later

482
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
So their lungs

483
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Baby study

484
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
There's no indication that lung issues are vaccine concerns killed even a single Mouse

485
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Cinestudy

486
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
How to making that up to make a story seem more in

487
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Interesting to Azadi

488
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Bird

489
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:32,864
Alex is making of the F the effects that the study found in vaccinated mice were faced with the Stars challenge

490
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:38,752
He's including autoimmune conditions in the list because that's been a big talking point on Infowars for a long time

491
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Sota meant to give him the appearance

492
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Being right

493
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,664
Strokes heart attacks and blood clots are included because these are things that people have been discussing

494
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
Is possibly related

495
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,248
The various vaccines for covid-19

496
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,624
There's not evidence of a causal link but a public conversation about concern surrounding those issues has

497
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Been going on

498
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,720
Analysis trying to exacerbate those concerns and scares audio

499
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,584
And in the study as we know the only real result was all of the mice had increased blood

500
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
That was not in the study

501
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Are you sure

502
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:11,264
The actual study doesn't involve any of the conditions that Alex was listing

503
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,568
The effect studied were entirely surrounded

504
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Damage to lung tissue

505
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
One of the following

506
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
Must be true

507
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,456
And I cannot stress this enough

508
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:23,552
Alex is either not read this study at all and it's just making all this stuff up

509
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
Has read the study

510
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
And he knows that he's lying to his audience about what it says disc error

511
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
There isn't a middle ground

512
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,744
But I will say that in that first

513
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
Possibility that first category is

514
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,888
Skimmed it and read a few words more like

515
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Still just making up what you think

516
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Those words

517
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
Bulshit

518
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,848
Yeah I love it I love it he looks at a

519
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Article

520
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
Probably looks

521
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,200
Like when you and I look at

522
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Something to read we like see all the words

523
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Right

524
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,856
I imagine every time he looks at one of these it's like a redacted document in it

525
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
His brain like his brain just about all the words that aren't likes

526
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
Usable it instead of the black bars it's like demon face

527
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
Clowns walking on cleats

528
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
The brown bag

529
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,920
I got to quit drinking instead of word that John Cleese silly walks but if it's a weird clown

530
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,992
So Alex is going to leave

531
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
You got to go maybe.

532
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
You know what

533
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,232
I'm just going to read the whole damn study on their house that's no

534
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
What sounds good

535
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
Music study

536
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
This spells it right out

537
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
In the summary on the front page

538
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,776
University of Texas

539
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,336
Level 4 bio weapons lab

540
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
Galveston Texas

541
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
There is no way he's reading this. You hungry

542
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:01,856
This whole overly-dramatic breakdown of having to go off air and then deciding to stay on there and read the whole study

543
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
You come off a lot more genuine if it hadn't followed the whole part of the beginning there were Alex's complaining that no one pays attention to him

544
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Unless you make a big

545
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
Do you have

546
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
It almost feels like this

547
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
Fake struggling that he's going through it's like a

548
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
Piece of the necessary performance that he has to Cairo

549
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Carry out to make anyone believe that this

550
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Pizza supposed evidence actually means anything

551
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Yeah

552
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
Yeah you know it reminds me of when James Brown

553
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
Blanket over his shoulders and be like I'm too tired I can't go on anymore

554
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,328
Performance I guess

555
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:48,960
But you know he's coming back especially if you're on tour with him and you've seen it

556
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360
I basically on tour with Alex

557
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
B r boring

558
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,272
Small point

559
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Pretend years

560
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
But UA

561
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
That's true that is true

562
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,840
They put out all of their shows if people listen to them

563
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
That's good point

564
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
All anyway small Point here during the lab at the University of Texas Galveston is a level 3 biosafety

565
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Labannata level 4

566
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
I feel like a

567
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,112
Stickler for pointing that out when Alex Ida was level for but

568
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,440
Difference between those two and also that information is literally on

569
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
Page 2 of the starting so

570
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:48,608
If you made it that far you know what level I was

571
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,888
In in in history

572
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Ain't going to do it

573
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
I kind of

574
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Going to do it

575
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,848
That sounds like

576
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Die

577
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
And they bled out though

578
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
They what

579
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,856
What are brain M sinus

580
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Whatever stomach

581
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
Flat out

582
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Flat out

583
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,864
Just like you shoot somebody with a 12-gauge shotgun

584
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Beyblade out about a minute

585
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,008
Best way to bleed out over the next few years my

586
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Wow

587
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,176
Everything to read an accurate scientific study that was just like

588
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
There was blood everywhere

589
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
It was bad luck

590
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,976
Everywhere we would God have mercy

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,816
I don't want to minimize be like

592
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,376
Gross Ness of

593
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
You're keeping his reading this

594
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
Now they've all these mice are euthanized

595
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,128
Completely different than with Alex's describe it

596
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
People injecting mice

597
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Swiffer vac seed and then

598
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Suddenly

599
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Exploding kittens

600
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,856
Blood-filled watching them bleed out

601
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,232
So Alex is lying about one line that I think someone must have highlighted for him in the study

602
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Mice where I nest

603
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
The tized with isoflurane and then bled from the retro-orbital sinus

604
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
Plexus

605
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
He's taking the second half of that setting

606
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,312
News about bleeding and then pretending that it didn't follow the first half where the mouse work

607
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,848
My swirl put down in accordance

608
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,128
The methodology of the study

609
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,760
This doesn't mean that the mice died bleeding from their noses but that's the image that Alex wants to use these words

610
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
Prefabricated

611
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Introduction

612
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
God

613
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
What have we done

614
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,656
That's too long whether or not we could

615
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
Make mice bleed out

616
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Yeah

617
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Alex makes up some more

618
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,712
2012 highly-respected a review

619
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
University of Texas long-term study

620
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,856
All sorts of different

621
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Finding massive blood clots

622
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Brain damage

623
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Heart attack

624
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Oregon

625
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,864
Ossining against vaccine

626
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
For the Coronavirus

627
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,568
So that clip is 23 seconds long and here is a list of I bet they're more but

628
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Maybe

629
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
I got six big 16 bit

630
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
What error is that is

631
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
It was not a long-term study

632
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
Right to it wasn't on all sorts of animals it was just my

633
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,112
3 it didn't find massive blood clot

634
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,672
Go for it didn't find brain damage

635
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
They didn't find heart attack show

636
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:59,584
65 Tashan with proceeding with the application of SARS coronavirus vaccine in humans

637
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
That's all good and well but it doesn't match

638
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,472
What's the what I was saying open Pandora

639
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Totally

640
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:14,432
Might be splitting hairs the photos major research study but I just gave him

641
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Just on account of beating out

642
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
Whatever you think it is

643
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
You're a gambler

644
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
I'm a gambler

645
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
Alex's brief summary of the study gets

646
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
So much

647
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
Completely wrong that even if you didn't suspect as I do that either willful liar you should be really worried about Isabella

648
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
Bodytech accurate information

649
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
From primary source

650
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
Even if you think he has a heart of gold and he means well and you know he's a good guy

651
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:45,408
This is a staggering display of inability to do the job he's tried to give himself

652
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Sometimes

653
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
I'll check in and I'll listen to these like

654
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Find a primary source going to be like

655
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,648
This is bad this is bad work this is funny

656
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
Yes so embarrassingly bad

657
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,096
This Is Our God this is like

658
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
You should have you should be

659
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Begin the segment

660
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,008
With that carnival music but in a minor key so you know we're entering into a real

661
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Locked up world

662
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
You know nothing

663
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,896
This is topsy-turvy World nothing's going to be real and it's all going to be terrifying

664
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,176
Just coming into

665
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
I agree

666
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
The man I can't even be

667
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
Begin to tell you there is a punchline

668
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
That

669
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
It's Lord milk

670
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,464
But now you

671
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
You must think of the mice

672
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Mackerel

673
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
You want to read

674
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Here

675
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
Overhead shot place what happened to the mice

676
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,360
Bleeding out my sinus bleeding out their brain

677
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
Waiting out there

678
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Young Mike

679
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Middle-aged my

680
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,504
A mice young mice

681
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
Middle-aged nice

682
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,904
Those nice picture you have mice or just getting ready to go off to college with their whole lives ahead of them

683
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
Mice that were two days away from retirement totally planning a life after the career at the software development store

684
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,192
Probably maybe going to get into the puzzles

685
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,592
Do with your old are your spouse

686
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
God dammit

687
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
But you got to think about the Adolescent mice

688
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,552
You just made the cut for the varsity football team scores

689
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,672
Cut down in their Prime

690
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
He he was almost going to make it in

691
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Three

692
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Tragic tragic

693
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
Middle Earth

694
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
People really really paid take a picture

695
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,336
Superman who killed that many dogs how dare he try to make me care about

696
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
What assholes again

697
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,784
Just to be totally clear I have reservations about the way animals are heaters

698
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:04,416
No I agree I don't want to unpack that right now then busy laughing at middle-aged

699
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
Quarterdeck

700
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Middle-aged

701
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
B o b they come for us all

702
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Continues to make stuff

703
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,032
Neutralizing antibody assay

704
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
What happened to the animal

705
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
University of Texas this year

706
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Cjis

707
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
This is the University

708
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,160
Did a long-term study on a bunch of vaccine

709
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
AR virus

710
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,448
Just skimming the paper now and he saw the headline neutralizing antibody acids

711
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
That's just the section about how post euthanasia of the samples are taken from the animals and processed into

712
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Such ways to preserve

713
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,968
Antibodies that might be detected were from the vaccine right there was given as polite

714
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
To another

715
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Source

716
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,624
Alex has no idea what the words he's saying even mean but you just knows that kind of sounds scary

717
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,976
Also this study has literally nothing to do with mRNA vaccine

718
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,048
None of the four vaccine studied where that type analysis

719
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,072
Who just throwing that in

720
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
To make the audience

721
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm scared of current-day covid-19 blacks

722
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Nation course

723
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Because

724
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
He has an agenda

725
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Boy

726
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Although again

727
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,592
It's it's

728
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
It's a lab

729
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
They're put down

730
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
It's not like Alex

731
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
Is making it sound like everybody is like okay

732
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,344
We injected them with the stuff and then they got a giant meat cleaver and they just

733
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
I don't know maybe there is a little bit of that but I think the image

734
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
Is that they injected them and then just watch

735
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,888
Probably

736
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
Counting the time

737
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
Very bizarre Twisted nonsense

738
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Yeah

739
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,104
I never have a vaccine for

740
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
What's the most common when the most common family

741
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,016
Because it's a freaking protein that your bodies made up out of

742
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
What else is

743
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Address

744
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,912
Giphy some pages of a pentagon

745
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:30,592
Supposed

746
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,456
Also the reason there wasn't a coronavirus vaccine prior to now is

747
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,320
Primarily because it's a challenging thing to do and money wasn't there for the Reeser

748
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,232
Most coronavirus is are not generally very severe and the two previous times there were series

749
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
Relatively

750
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Containment measures and proper protocols

751
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,168
I never got to the point where money was flowing in as an urgent solution was needed

752
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Recognize

753
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,008
Right

754
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,080
And thankfully we also had some preliminary work done in

755
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Forms of studies that were done in the wake of

756
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
SARS and MERS

757
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
That helped inform

758
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
Current efforts

759
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Going on

760
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,552
Of course coronavirus vaccine probably could have been made

761
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
When the past

762
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,672
It just would have been a question of marshaling efforts and resources into the right places

763
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,488
And that wasn't the something that was seen as a good investment

764
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Until

765
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Hopefully

766
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,656
Yeah yeah you know I would like it if more people realized it's

767
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Science

768
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
It succeeds is

769
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
The culmination of failure

770
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
And not like

771
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,360
A a simple moment of single

772
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
A brilliant inspiration that appears out of

773
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,968
Nowhere it's the culmination of

774
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
Years upon years upon years of work

775
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,088
Overly simplistic Lee like 100 things

776
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Could go wrong and then

777
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,744
Could lead to something that's really huge you know you're not going to make the playoffs

778
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
If you have Owen 100 record

779
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
We're trained

780
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
To have this win loss kind of likes

781
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Success failure

782
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
Way we look at

783
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,288
It's a different paradigm

784
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
It's completely

785
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
Different Paradigm the goal

786
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Cuz if you

787
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
Fail all the time then when you succeed your like holyshit this is real

788
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Yeah

789
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
So Alex

790
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
It has a bit of

791
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,624
White identity based

792
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,672
Sears around

793
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,792
Carol Baker CDC spokeswoman telling a giant

794
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,352
Amphitheater both scientists and doctors and nurses

795
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,424
Dad must be got rid of

796
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Because I don't

797
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,056
That's what this is coming from and I guess we do have to have an Irish Scottish

798
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
English

799
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Thousand Years a war

800
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,944
Between those groups in Kingstree

801
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
Nike where the Magna Carta

802
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
And injuries and basic rights come from yes

803
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
That's what white people

804
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,184
Really

805
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
Wow

806
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,584
I don't even know where to begin with all of the things

807
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
Wrapped up in just

808
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
That likes just saying that means like

809
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
You extrapolate

810
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,264
It means if this is real

811
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
Serta white people creative freedom

812
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:17,248
Just a stray thought maybe he was in too deep on a sentence

813
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
It's fundamental to his worldview that no other culture

814
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
Has ever created any system

815
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Afridi Afridi

816
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,816
Freedom is essentially a white creation

817
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Cannot possibly believe

818
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Anything else happen

819
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
It's outrageous

820
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:41,824
Imagine him reading a book about a matriarchal

821
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Society

822
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,688
Matriarchal societies that have existed in our past I can't even imagine

823
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
And how much

824
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Better they are

825
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
Better is relative

826
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
Systems that work better for

827
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
Circumstance

828
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
I'm sorry my anthropology

829
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,048
I respect

830
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Like it

831
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
I just

832
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
You are very troubled by that

833
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
That's really f***** up

834
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:13,568
Yeah yeah he's talking about about doctor Carol Baker

835
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,688
Clip posted all over right-wing media it's

836
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,832
And it's a Doctor Baker is saying that the solution to getting rid of vaccine denial is getting rid of white

837
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:30,208
This is not at all being suggested as a serious solution it's clearly mad as a shock

838
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
Statement that furthers a different argument

839
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Which is conveniently added out of

840
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
The clip that gets posted all over the media

841
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,424
Most of the places to find this clip of it where they post it

842
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,752
Super vague about where the video comes from sometimes just a year

843
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
And it's often the wrong gear

844
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,616
I suspect this isn't intentional strategy to make it harder for the audience

845
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,664
To confirm the claims that are being made about it

846
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,320
I tracked down the full video when it's from a panel discussion being held by the national meningitis Association titled quote

847
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Achieving childhood vaccine success of the United

848
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,256
It's not a giant Amphitheater but that doesn't work for Alex and the audiences

849
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
Just going to accept whatever dumb shity says

850
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,144
The larger context of the comment was in terms of a conversation about

851
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,912
Strategies

852
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Increase vaccination

853
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
Another panelist had suggested media training

854
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,104
For doctors and there was some disagreement about whether or not the media training would be impactful

855
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Dr. Baker was

856
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,248
Expressing that at that position that the discussion to get children vaccinated as an individual event that happened

857
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,576
And over and over all over the country every day we get training

858
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Might not necessarily be the most helpful thing

859
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,976
The conversation had also touched on Multicultural issues like communities

860
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
The claim exemptions

861
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
From school vaccine mandates

862
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
The comic Baker

863
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
Made appears to exist in the intersection of these two ideas

864
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,448
It's kind of a freewheeling panel discussion

865
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,104
Kind of go off on some tangent short makes it a little bit difficult to know exactly where she was going short discussion

866
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Absolutely certain

867
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
It has nothing to do with

868
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,687
Appealing to White.

869
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,527
I don't know I don't know that sounds like this nonsense

870
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
I feel like maybe the CDC is overreacting a little bit to the Trump years but calling for white genocide does she was

871
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,255
With the CDC at the time I believed I think she was of course

872
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Snapchat

873
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
Previously

874
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
Let's just live

875
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
Yeah but Alex Boye

876
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
What a mess

877
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Yeah that's not

878
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,775
Oh man he's in a mood

879
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
Man

880
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
I mean

881
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,151
English Irish and Scotch thing

882
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
They invented

883
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
Freedom

884
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Like there was no

885
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,671
What's cuz they were fighting about Kings or something if you want

886
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Goku

887
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
White nationalist claim Rome 2 or what

888
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:49,215
Yes yes the people who we most associate

889
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Freedom

890
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:56,895
I don't know man he's in a mood and I think I might be able to tell you why

891
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
Hearing today

892
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,599
Wonders of family court so that's why I take some

893
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Because I got to go

894
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
There is a so much to cover and so much to get

895
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,631
WonderFest do anything with his motive be a bad mood might be why he's fine with everybody dying

896
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,471
Could be fine I could be something pretty sad that I like

897
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,263
The mystery becomes clear

898
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,663
This is like this scene in like a Poirot thing where it's like the name of this town

899
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
This is this is the dinner party

900
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,783
I will slowly revealed

901
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,623
Perpetrator of the kayak to go to Family Court

902
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
Caught him

903
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,791
This is why this is a bombshell no one pays attention to you and everyone's got to die

904
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Yeah

905
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Great

906
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
It does not stop hours

907
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Even though he has to leave

908
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Early

909
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Don't stop him from

910
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
Continuing to be wrong about everything about this study

911
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:03,455
Headshot Place well this just got brought to my attention I went checking on the University of Texas website

912
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
This is the University of Texas

913
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,879
Biological Research Center level for when the most prestigious in the world

914
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccine

915
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
Pulmonary

916
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
Autoimmune response

917
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
In response to the end of my

918
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
What's the weather

919
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
And then the photos and all of it

920
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,151
Control group

921
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
Lowe's at work

922
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:38,015
Challenge got really sick

923
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
What

924
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Wait what

925
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
You should not

926
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Vaccine

927
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:53,631
Show me those f****** photo

928
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Mercy

929
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Texas

930
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
So glad isn't level four

931
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,591
Amino pathology does not mean autoimmune

932
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,151
Nope the article has nothing to do with autoimmune condition correct

933
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,479
Alex is making up how he imagines this test with run

934
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
The only mice in the study were not challenged with the live stars were the five from each group there were killed today

935
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,415
Two days early so they could have their lungs

936
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
The entire story of the vaccinated group getting

937
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,303
Sick after the challenge and non-vaccinated grouping fine

938
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
That just comes from Alex's imagination

939
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,935
There were no photos on the study of hearts or brains because

940
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
The only about the lungs

941
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,775
That's the word Alex keeps tripping over in the study

942
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,543
Title

943
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Pulmonary

944
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:38,175
Alex is making up with the other photos are there or maybe he hallucinated them I'm not sure

945
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Also they tested

946
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,831
Before vaccines in the study I was just thinks there were three because he was skimming and he saw the line

947
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,903
Three different experiments performed for comparing

948
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,207
Different vaccines are reported here

949
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,071
On page 82 that's the word that quote comes but the beginning of these study design sex

950
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
In reality there were four vac

951
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,471
Then we're the same type of vaccine whole virus vaccines but they were

952
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
A differently

953
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
Adidas different adjuvant

954
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
So they were experimental lead singer

955
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,127
Also none of the vaccines killed any

956
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
Writes all nonsense

957
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
Alex cannot

958
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
F****** handle

959
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Doing a

960
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
Again I mean

961
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
Just want to read that study

962
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Weather like

963
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,391
Bucket Man

964
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,999
There are brains with holes in them dude put it in the sky

965
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
Sarah Grey

966
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
Awesome

967
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
He continues lying

968
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,263
I'll get Bill Gates in the UN and the globalist this they've got the size of the Grand Canyon

969
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,663
Teton

970
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Lab level 4

971
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,759
Falmouth all coronavirus vaccine

972
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
Cause bleeding analogues the brain the heart

973
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,391
Blood clots

974
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,351
Police Department

975
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
No pathology

976
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,727
All the challenge subjects all the ladder

977
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,543
That is from

978
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,895
2012 there's a bunch of the reports coming out they knew this they did it

979
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
When your loved one has a heart attack

980
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,439
Please don't forget Wurlitzer supported turbo Fortune

981
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
Holyshit

982
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Oh boy

983
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,303
That was 90 degrees

984
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Goddamn

985
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
That hurt

986
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,727
I feel like I was in a 30 mile an hour car crash

987
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
That sounds like a guy

988
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,175
Walking like a cat

989
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,503
You got to go to court with his ex-wife

990
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,807
So Alex has next winter

991
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,647
On for a little bit and I point this out on our last episode but

992
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
When the two of them were talking

993
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,559
Alex said that Nick Fuentes was going to get a channel on banned. Video on Alex's site

994
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
And I just took that to be straight talk because he said that you almost everybody

995
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,775
Almost everybody who's nuts and a problem

996
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:18,175
Yeah Nick has an America first channel on Alex's website

997
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Or actually that's better

998
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,807
Keep it all there get rid of everything else

999
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,647
Stop so he's also got another iron in the fire but he's going to

1000
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
Explain here

1001
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,231
So I was on your show last week to talk

1002
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,303
Talk about my placement on the no-fly list which we

1003
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,703
Political reasons

1004
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Rappers that Mina Kasich

1005
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
Guess the TSA and

1006
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,015
We're going to take it to the chords again to TSA in the federal government

1007
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
I guess stand-up didn't work out

1008
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
Wow

1009
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,183
Huh who is running

1010
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
Norma's running a good game

1011
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
I don't know about that

1012
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,863
I need something about some idiot just suddenly calling you because

1013
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
Alex Jones and being like

1014
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,775
F*** it yeah I'll run your dumb lawsuit that's not going to go anywhere you

1015
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Idiot

1016
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
Yeah I guess there

1017
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,127
There does appear to be a space

1018
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
For like

1019
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
I mean

1020
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
This is

1021
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Stam

1022
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
Absolutely not a real loss

1023
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
No it it's

1024
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
A fundraising opportunity for Nicolette

1025
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:35,487
And if Norms going to skim some of that off in like a billable hours over

1026
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
That I guess that is a career path you could go down as look like Larry klayman did that for years violin

1027
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:46,495
Frivolous nonsense lawsuit

1028
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
I don't know anything about

1029
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,895
I don't know a lot about it. I know it seems like

1030
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,455
Return to the races play Blake

1031
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
You know getting a bed with

1032
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,831
That's just being associated with a deeply like

1033
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
This is just what happened it is

1034
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Ends up like

1035
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
It gets ruined doing interviews

1036
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
Stefan molyneux

1037
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,631
The norm doing racist stand up and hanging out with Nick Fuentes

1038
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,679
Yeah you just can't you can't do it

1039
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
If you can't you can't

1040
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,751
I mean I want to do something else

1041
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,311
Can exist in the modern-day without being awake

1042
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Anyway so

1043
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
So Alex goes off the family court

1044
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
And

1045
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
Yeah I know he's off the family

1046
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,599
So comes back in May 7th

1047
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,767
I mean not when his shows on you like them showing up like for the War Room something

1048
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
Resume he came back and had a little bit of a

1049
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,399
A business meeting with a bottle

1050
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
Sure

1051
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:55,103
This is very little doubt of that there's a lot of work to get done around the office like that chair needed to be thrown over there

1052
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
I redecorated

1053
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,479
You know what the problem with that wall was

1054
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
And there were zero holes in it

1055
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
It is

1056
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
An Unforgivable

1057
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
So Alex Alex comes back on the 7th

1058
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
And it gets on air

1059
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Hi

1060
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
I was

1061
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Lord by how boring

1062
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,911
The first like half hour

1063
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
He says

1064
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Nothing

1065
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Treading water

1066
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
It's just like here I am

1067
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,591
Tower of I'm about to

1068
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,919
Kind of but I didn't actually feel like he was about to

1069
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,319
It felt like other people might be getting to something he's not.

1070
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Here's a little clip

1071
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
Government outlaw

1072
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
The government's Criminal

1073
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,791
Global run

1074
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,375
Following its directives is now

1075
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
Crime against your family matters

1076
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
Idiot is unconstitutional crap

1077
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,567
Any of the contact tracers any intimidation have inoculation

1078
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
Body

1079
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
Literally the engineer this whole damn thing

1080
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,671
I listen to stuff like that and I just I can't understand how anybody could listen to Alex

1081
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,999
Take him seriously and not recognize that

1082
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
Terrorism is the directing

1083
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
That's

1084
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,887
The state is basically

1085
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
The only logical outcome

1086
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Some of the things

1087
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,263
But he said if you believe the things that he's saying

1088
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
There is no solution

1089
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
You're fighting the

1090
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Devil

1091
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
That the devil doesn't care about court

1092
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Election

1093
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
No

1094
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
There's no

1095
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:36,991
There's no

1096
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Making peace with the

1097
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
The devil

1098
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,599
You have to eradicate

1099
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:46,207
Yes and then the people who follow him and he's surprised all that's left is

1100
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:52,351
People are your friends but I guess I'm not being totally fair because the other conclusion could be complete isolate

1101
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:58,495
Like you could have communes in the woods looking like that complete

1102
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,055
The only two legitimate outcome

1103
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,359
Good luck political organization is meaningless

1104
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,895
Right okay

1105
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Now the government is

1106
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
Outlaw

1107
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
Any kind of rules

1108
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Come from the government

1109
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:14,367
Are not to be followed

1110
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,439
Why would you run for office couldn't do s***

1111
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
Azure by the devil

1112
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
B

1113
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
I just

1114
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,839
I was I was thinking about that cuz I was so bored by the beginning

1115
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Images

1116
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,935
It strikes me that anybody

1117
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Like who

1118
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
Takes this seriously

1119
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
I just can't

1120
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,591
Or if they would be doing something horrible

1121
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,943
Pixelmon this okay they've already tried to topple the government and it didn't go well

1122
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
So try isolation

1123
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,039
Everybody in the right way

1124
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
Just needs to go away

1125
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,903
Well I I would recommend isolation

1126
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
With another individual for about an hour a week

1127
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Chatting about

1128
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
What do you think

1129
00:53:54,303 --> 00:54:00,447
I just talked about the problems another person

1130
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
So Alex

1131
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,479
The day before his Mufflers lying about the study

1132
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
And I'm not going to lie you doesn't work

1133
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,111
But today is different mood

1134
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:23,999
I would describe his mood as being very similar to a guy who went to Family Court the day before

1135
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
Fuel prices

1136
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,839
Exploding

1137
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,703
And that's why I said to do a basket of commodities

1138
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
My B myself

1139
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,775
David Buster

1140
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,359
A place in the country.

1141
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
But away from people

1142
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,503
Having your own game

1143
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,551
Your own people watch each other's back

1144
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
Universe

1145
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,207
Jesus Christ

1146
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,767
So you better get ready now

1147
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,959
But I really planned out there to start a race war

1148
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
Economic collapse

1149
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
This is all a battle plan

1150
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,103
We know what they're going to do we should have been able to stop it

1151
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Didn't listen now

1152
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
I don't say that

1153
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,599
Impressive it's just know what you've done peeping is on the air

1154
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,535
The big show called government

1155
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583

Pedophile operations at Industrial Level

1162
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
Like a combine cut sweet

1163
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
Mail day

1164
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
Your similes unclog

1165

With

1167
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879

Absolutely end

1173
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
Just incidental

1174
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
By the way

1175
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
Unplug this

1176
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Hey while we're here

1177
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Look

1178
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
It's a favor

1179
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,455
Really think about it

1180
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
You think about it I am

1181
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Gifting you the

This plug

1183
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
Is a blessing and so

1184
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
In order for you to repay that

1185
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
You need to buy lots of

1186
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,279
Now

1187
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
Dallas.com or just find a subsection

1188
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,471
Food

1189
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
I buy more ammunition

1190
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
You said you have none

1191
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,103
Selling my house in Austin

1192
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,783
I'm telling you right now he's dealing with that

1193
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Sure

1194
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,791
50 million

1195
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
90% chance

1196
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,215
It's all over

1197
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
I never talk like that never said everything about you

1198
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
Said anything like that

1199
00:57:54,431 --> 00:58:00,575
Roughly 7 billion people will be exterminated only 500 million Arlo

1200
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:05,695
I never talk like that for almost all the time

1201
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
Sayre

1202
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,511
I'm not that's not my thing

1203
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:13,631
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to scare you also boo

1204
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Now you should be terrified of all the people coming

1205
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
Kill you

1206
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Ensure

1207
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,519
They look nice

1208
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,151
I say nice things and they're exactly like you and they're just normal people but they're actually working for the devil in you

1209
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,431
You should murder them

1210
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
Road Warrior

1211
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Android

1212
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,087
Road Warriors 9:55 yet manual for 9:55

1213
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,111
Oh yeah

1214
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Oh that's right

1215
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Yeah but you know

1216
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
50 to 100 million

1217
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,791
That seems pretty good for a road warrior

1218
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,327
Situation

1219
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:48,447
Situation

1220
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,775
No I'm kind of green

1221
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:57,663
That was the worst Road Warrior was going to get it I feel like it could be worse

1222
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
Fair enough

1223
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
So

1224
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,111
You know it's glass half empty glass half-full half-empty

1225
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,135
Everybody does that

1226
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Alex

1227
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
This study

1228
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,255
But he found he was lying about all day yesterday

1229
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
To a guy who works

1230
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,071
UT

1231
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
Who knows who this guy is

1232
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,167
The guy and I just thought this was really silly

1233
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,919
What's a heads-up and apartments University of Texas

1234
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,551
I know this person for a long time

1235
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,391
And when I don't respond

1236
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
But he responded back in about 20 minutes

1237
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,559
Hey Eugene put out this big study under the federal government

1238
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
I didn't even say

1239
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
They said it was bad don't take

1240
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
K

1241
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Thanks Maxine

1242
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
The 2012

1243
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
I said hey

1244
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
You keep without this interesting report

1245
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,463
Adecco

1246
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
I'll show you a text

1247
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Okay the name

1248
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
Texting me

1249
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
Very technical

1250
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
But

1251
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Obviously

1252
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
Vaccine at 8

1253
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
This is a warning

1254
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,991
The study was a war knife

1255
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,111
Dirty work out in public

1256
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:46,463
But I really really don't give a s*** about what anybody on any board

1257
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:55,167
I also the guy saying that he's not going to entirely sure what all of his medical issues

1258
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
That he's like

1259
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,055
He's probably not a younger person

1260
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:05,663
And also they had covid already told them

1261
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:11,295
This is what he reads from the text message they already had a lot of

1262
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
Antibodies sure

1263
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,623
Naturally occurring from heaven

1264
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,695
Covid-19

1265
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Get a shot which is

1266
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,559
I don't know I'm not a doctor so I don't know but that's slightly different than

1267
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:26,911
Don't get the shot that appealed to kill you

1268
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:33,567
Pictures of holes in your brain slightly different pieces of advice be a different angle

1269
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
This is a warning

1270
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,407
It's just so dumb of it so dumb

1271
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
I'd like to warn Alex

1272
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
No

1273
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,647
You should know what you're talkin about arrest you sound really stupid like that

1274
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Good morning

1275
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Elimination

1276
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,511
Sartre bars vaccine leads to

1277
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
Anybody ology

1278
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
I'm challenge

1279
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,887
SARS virus

1280
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Emu

1281
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,959
Challenge

1282
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Autoimmune

1283
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,663
Responses and their hearts and lungs.

1284
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
White holes in a minute.

1285
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
I feel like I'm flogging a dead horse or

1286
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Possibly a Deadmau5 here but

1287
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:25,791
I can constantly hitting his drama valix not knowing anything about the study that he's reporting live but he just keeps being wrong and new ways

1288
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,447
He's wrong about the details of this study but I think it's more disturbing that he doesn't understand basic terminology that

1289
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
It's used

1290
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,823
Which makes me think that he doesn't even have a handle on the most Elementary conversation that's going on in terms of

1291
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
This study

1292
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,895
As well as any others that he might be

1293
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,991
The term challenge refers to the group of mice

1294
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,295
Vaccinated as opposed to the ones that were not

1295
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,087
And that's not what that term means

1296
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:54,463
In case of this study there were groups of mice that were given various non-experimental injections

1297
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Deserve his control

1298
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Princeton

1299
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,815
Control group got actual live sorry

1300
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,351
Another just got the address

1301
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,655
Sure the term challenge refers to taking

1302
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
All of the mice

1303
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
An experimental

1304
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
And control group

1305
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,567
And challenging their immunity by exposing them to live sorry

1306
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,871
That's what this experiment did

1307
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,175
And it's critical to understand that concept

1308
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,967
Understand the study at all

1309
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
To any degree

1310
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,807
Really dumb and it's funny but

1311
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
This instant is almost getting it

1312
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
Embarrassing

1313
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
Like this this is

1314
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
Disqualifying

1315
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
I think

1316
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
So far his

1317
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Description

1318
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Suggestive like

1319
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Here's what US

1320
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
Study is

1321
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
Give me great

1322
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Just like

1323
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
This is true with

1324
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
Just about everybody

1325
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Who is like

1326
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
Just describe how you do a study

1327
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,967
After this is supposed to be after he's read how they did this.

1328
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
Port over it

1329
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:55,391
Tell me how is his coverage give me a simple like

1330
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Here's the

1331
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,975
Beginning of the study and explain to me what you think sign

1332
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,839
I mean I don't I didn't see this but it turns out that this

1333
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
Studies actually

1334
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,167
Giving

1335
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
The vaccine around

1336
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
Going to kill kids

1337
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,847
Now they're going to Target the little children and mess them up or lie

1338
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
Oh man

1339
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
Wow

1340
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,199
My goal suddenly all these

1341
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
Bravo's

1342
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,183
How do the University of Texas says don't do it

1343
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
You don't care

1344
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
Got sick and died

1345
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Blade

1346
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Liberal

1347
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,935
You're saving me

1348
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,495
Not care because I'm liberal

1349
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,543
I don't care cuz I read the source

1350
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Well that would

1351
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,383
Don't you remember where the source was like

1352
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,175
Baba Yaga

1353
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,759
Video without holding their brains and then rats broken

1354
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:59,391
Ain't nobody San Jose or exploding given to children that

1355
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
Villanova delayed

1356
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:09,119
Address where younger as an old rats in this circumstance

1357
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
Make this more comfortable

1358
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Proof

1359
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,543
At the end of last week the world

1360
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
Is reeling

1361
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
From the news

1362
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
Bill and Melinda Gates where I get a divorce

1363
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,247
I didn't care both into the sun

1364
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
I didn't care for Alex's

1365
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
Ruth I thought I did

1366
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,927
It turns out there's a massive conspiracy here

1367
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,487
Why would I

1368
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,791
Robert Barnes has shown up

1369
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,863
Alex is now explained

1370
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,191
How does all Alex should know how family

1371
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,215
Play courtworks

1372
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,007
Pretty well well

1373
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:54,175
I mean what why why was Jason them crazy enough to do this I think it's cuz he got busted with Epstein

1374
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:02,623
Operation lockstep on the Shelf

1375
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,903
Okay

1376
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
What are words in there

1377
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
She's basically

1378
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,535
Probably

1379
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,631
But yeah he's very adverbs

1380
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
R2

1381
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,703
Batman

1382
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
Siri is essentially that Bill Gates got caught up with Epstein is all going to come out

1383
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
He's going to take the

1384
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
The fall for it

1385
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Right now

1386
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,479
And so his wife divorce to protect

1387
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,527
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

1388
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,063
And

1389
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,367
She's confirmed it probably

1390
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,391
Basically

1391
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,695
Probably pretty much

1392
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,791
There was a story I saw in the Wall Street Journal that will I was about how

1393
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
Melinda Gates was mad

1394
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,887
About Bill Gates having an association

1395
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
With Epstein

1396
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Why

1397
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:53,311
Does good actor actually strike

1398
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,919
Some people have made comments about that but

1399
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,223
I think the the bridge that Alec

1400
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,503
Texas Crossing is a little bit

1401
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Yeah

1402
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
I mean well

1403
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
Here's the big

1404
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,647
Here's the bigger issue

1405
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
Is there

1406
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Yeah

1407
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,767
She knows he was hanging out with Epstein any went to the Isla

1408
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,327
It would be insane if she was not at least

1409
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
A little bit

1410
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,119
Concerned about that

1411
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,423
You know so that's not really a story to me

1412
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
We all know

1413
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
He spent time on Epps

1414
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,055
Kings Island we all think Bill Gates is an evil

1415
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
Bastard

1416
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,455
What is fine you know I don't care why they're being divorced I just want them shot on a rocket into the sun

1417
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Sherbet

1418
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,039
You have to understand that the divorce is a Critic

1419
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
Copart of covid

1420
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
Existing

1421
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Definitely not

1422
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:44,511
Pick understanding that because the divorce is protecting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now that Bill Gates

1423
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
About to go down

1424
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
But

1425
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,095
Covid was released

1426
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Because

1427
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
You know the Epstein connections were

1428
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,983
Coming out in like 2019 shorter

1429
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,567
F****** panic button

1430
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:01,407
Right and then there was a worldwide plague in order for Bill Gates's

1431
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,247
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this particular aspect

1432
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
Conspiracy considering

1433
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
As Alex has told us

1434
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
So

1435
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
Many times

1436
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
He knows exactly how this is all going to play out

1437
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
Because this is

1438
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,815
Improvisational storytelling not actual

1439
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,119
Snooze Aretha possible

1440
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:28,287
It seems like a fun wrinkle for Bill gaither's character a good way to contextualize the divorce

1441
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Yeah this is character development

1442
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Barnes

1443
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
Isn't it also Alex calls him Barnes

1444
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,247
And I feel like don't fuc

1445
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,063
Can call your lawyer by their last name that's just not cool

1446
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,903
No no no I want to get my lawyer and Nick

1447
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,183
Call my lawyer Dickie

1448
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,583
You are f***** if you are that familiar

1449
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
With your lawyer

1450
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:59,007
I want to call my lawyer mr.

1451
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:04,383
Professional distance between us

1452
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,967
I don't want to be like

1453
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,319
Survivor lawyer with a question about something else

1454
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,623
I don't want to text my lawyer when I'm drunk

1455
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,487
Hey Dicky come out today come on buddy

1456
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
We'll go drink

1457
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,791
So Barnes of got some news

1458
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,375
Barnes is about to give you exclusive

1459
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Information

1460
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
Here is the exclusive

1461
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
Information

1462
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
As Humanity

1463
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,127
Yes I want to be filing suit

1464
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
The next 2 weeks across

1465
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
Country against three groups

1466
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Governments

1467
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,783
Employers and educational institutions

1468
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,831
Attempting to force or coerce

1469
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:52,255
So Barnes is going to go spread a bunch of attention-grabbing lawsuits around

1470
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
Special

1471
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
I just ice

1472
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
I find it in

1473
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
Possible

1474
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
To believe

1475
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,703
That you could listen to this entire show

1476
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Here Alex

1477
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Say that

1478
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
The government

1479
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
What is an outlaw

1480
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:10,687
And then listen to Barnes he's going to file some lawsuits and be like you get them yeah this is going to solve this

1481
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:17,087
This is an exclusive that I wanted to hear about it I can't wait to throw some money at Barnes please

1482
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,487
Support these lawsuits Windows to

1483
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
Ben will then we'll put his plan off for at least

1484
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,095
Warriors

1485
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:31,679
Comical nonsense he's asking the audience

1486
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,799
Yeah wild I don't think much of Barney

1487
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
Boris

1488
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,663
You have to go away get ammo

1489
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
Food

1490
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,527
Hi prepare for the road warrior

1491
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Weave

1492
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,671
Sell some of that Amo

1493
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
Jesus man

1494
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,487
Rodger Barnes

1495
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,791
And I wasn't like really all that worried about the

1496
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,863
His lawsuit going anywhere

1497
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
Is not going anywhere

1498
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,423
Tell well working with Bob

1499
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
HobbyKids

1500
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
And others

1501
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,543
All of the legal issues related to these cases and the Constitutional issues

1502
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,103
We will have the suits filed within the next two weeks

1503
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,407
He's working with Robert Kennedy the anti-vax

1504
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Kingpin

1505
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:19,295
Yeah it was not going to work out

1506
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,951
No I see I feel like Barnes was doing that to cover up the stink of the name Robert Kennedy

1507
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:31,839
Robert Kennedy Jr

1508
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,655
Sirhan Sirhan actually hiding or what

1509
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:40,287
Another person I don't want to be on familiar terms

1510
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
So

1511
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,919
I'm going to skip ahead real quick

1512
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
Because I want a barn

1513
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
Explain his loss

1514
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
We are suing under the Ada

1515
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,831
The Discrimination Act

1516
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Perceived as disabled

1517
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,511
We're going to be doing the same thing

1518
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
Because my view is that

1519
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,631
Requiring someone

1520
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
And then treating them differently based on

1521
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,191
Perception

1522
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,239
Is discriminating against them based on

1523
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
Your perception of their disability

1524
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,407
In-state analogous laws that are also similar

1525
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:21,759
So the fact that Barnes is working with Robert Kennedy and the idea that

1526
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:27,135
Keystone of his argument combined to tell me this is not a case he expects to win

1527
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
To be in court

1528
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
The day

1529
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,463
Says those exact words

1530
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
To a judge

1531
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:36,863
Just on its face I suspect this will get thrown out but there's a huge element of disability law the barn scene

1532
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
To be pretending

1533
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Doesn't exist

1534
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:42,239
According to the government's page on disability discrimination they do make a

1535
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
Very important caveat

1536
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:50,943
The law requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee or job applicant with a disability unless doing so

1537
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,271
So would cause significant difficulty or expense for the employer

1538
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
An undue hardship

1539
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,623
Even if somehow Barnes were able to convince

1540
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
Record that not wanted

1541
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
Can you get a vaccine with legally analogous to heaven

1542
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,047
The disability he would still have a really hard time overcoming the argument

1543
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,863
But having people potentially spreading covid around a workplace or

1544
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
School

1545
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:13,471
Doesn't represent an undue hardship on an employer or

1546
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Educational

1547
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
Institution

1548
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:20,639
You run the risk of yours Workforce or teaching staff falling ill and that's not even considering the potential

1549
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Haven't

1550
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,175
Shutdown

1551
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,223
Factory or possible bad press

1552
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Second come from

1553
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,783
Being a site of a new outbreak

1554
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
Pride month

1555
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,623
Nick Fuentes trying to sue the TSA this is not a

1556
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
A serious case

1557
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,487
There's a griffin a PR stunt disguised as a legitimate lawsuit

1558
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,047
It's all just grandstanding and attention-seeking behavior

1559
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
It's wasting everyone's f****** time

1560
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
Yep but I do I do also

1561
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Want to be in the

1562
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,263
I do think you'll be pretty funny

1563
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,079
It's never going to make it to a courtroom

1564
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
Absolutely.

1565
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,919
Like I do get that lawyer ring is a

1566
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Shannon lawyers

1567
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
Text each other and you know

1568
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
Judges don't often hold lawyers in contempt

1569
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
Of course more

1570
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
Say

1571
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,647
I don't know going on Infowars

1572
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:09,535
Isn't saying that the stated reason that you're doing this lawsuit is based on magical nonsense thinking that you don't

1573
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Understand what soap

1574
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,351
Clever

1575
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
F****** talking about

1576
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,191
Yeah you know what I think the issue is Barnes is

1577
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:22,591
I think that he's less a lawyer and more a guy who has a page on Dave room

1578
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,151
Patreon clone called local

1579
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,735
That sounds like it and I think you promoting his locals page

1580
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,295
With the looming idea of these lawsuits

1581
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:36,159
Great I think that he's just trying to sucker people into supporting him on fake patreon

1582
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:40,255
And yeah bro how did that lawyer Collective

1583
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,535
Constitutional lawyers

1584
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,303
Workout

1585
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,911
Remember that one from a few years ago when he was going to start that group of people

1586
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,287
Yeah I don't know if that

1587
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
Bad ideas I'm actually kind of glad that

1588
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,687
It didn't seem like it happens to get a lot of money for it

1589
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
What happened all that bull

1590
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,015
Oh

1591
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
Well

1592
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,695
Hey would you like to know how the Chinese people make covid

1593
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,999
Subject

1594
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,535
This clip is nonsense

1595
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Okay

1596
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
Milan

1597
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,151
One that got the got the virus

1598
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,175
Bullmastiff

1599
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,479
Did you replicate that the pig

1600
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,439
Can you do it then used to extract the blood

1601
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:46,559
The viruses you one now you got about growth of viruses and you keep rolling them

1602
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,839
And then you release it

1603
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
In the human population where start

1604
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:02,431
It wasn't free Marshalls

1605
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Five on steroids

1606
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Before everybody

1607
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:11,135
Call Michelle

1608
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,695
Of course oh my God it's so obvious

1609
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
What

1610
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
It's so obvious

1611
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,703
Look Occam's razor tells me that's exactly what happened

1612
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,727
Alright

1613
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,543
Sci-fi come with a warning label

1614
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:34,943
Like a warning advisory for people who cannot tell the difference between reality and

1615
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:40,319
Steve is really going to f*** you up like what Alex just said

1616
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,927
Test before you can read science fiction

1617
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,279
Maybe we need to have some sort of comprehension test words like listen

1618
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
It's like a family video

1619
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:56,191
Do you know like they got those they got the room in the back with all the foreign you got to be 18 to go that road

1620
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
Library should have that

1621
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Forsyth

1622
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:06,687
Expands people's minds in such a way that you know as a young boy reading like Ray Bradbury or something

1623
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,343
Unlock a lot of creativity

1624
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,623
Added me as a young boy

1625
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,207
I think that's the case for a lot of people

1626
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
I think that the good outweighs the

1627
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
Because I think

1628
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
The case of Alex is showing

1629
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,631
Stop saying 18 I'm saying there should be a test

1630
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:31,263
I don't want to limit the excess of sci-fi to the the Young

1631
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,311
Kids out there

1632
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,871
Might be Overkill might be Overkill

1633
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:42,271
As far as I know there is only one person who has a relationship with sci-fi like Alex

1634
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:53,279
Very bad very bad reality for a lot of people to live there and it's

1635
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Very profitable

1636
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,631
I don't think that

1637
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,935
I don't think we need to regulate Syfy

1638
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,007
Might be an overreaction I bought that that boss

1639
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,311
Blue Sky

1640
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,871
Reasons for this man

1641
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,199
He says that they're going to feed a pig to another pig to get the

1642
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
The first

1643
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,319
I do like the idea though that Alex explains all that

1644
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Obvious

1645
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,135
Barnes's react

1646
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,159
Exactly

1647
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Exactly

1648
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
What are you

1649
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
People

1650
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,535
In your brain

1651
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,119
This is what I'm talking about when you go back to 2003 and you have these gas

1652
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
That are a little bit at least like

1653
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,447
On their own turf

1654
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:38,847
They're not these bootlicker

1655
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
So we got to learn about a false flag

1656
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,647
I think Barnes might be wrong

1657
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,439
Digging deep

1658
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
Find out the claim is not an organic

1659
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,791
The clan would rise and fall

1660
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,119
Locations in power supported them or not

1661
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,167
They were weaponized tools

1662
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,495
The Establishment infrastructure local to the community

1663
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
Organic group

1664
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
That's why you don't need that supposedly

1665
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
Clan made up of poor white people

1666
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,455
Those poor white people that have been some rich white

1667
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,991
People hanging from trees

1668
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
Hoo-boy

1669
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
Hellboy

1670
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
Want

1671
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Barnes

1672
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
To speak

1673
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
And now

1674
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
That he has

1675
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
I regret

1676
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:31,583
Swag my friend

1677
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
That is

1678
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,983
Yeah it's a bummer Bellboy

1679
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,031
So also he thinks

1680
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,079
Not only that the claim is a false flag

1681
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
Antifa

1682
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
Is

1683
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,527
Was legitimately in an artistic group

1684
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,111
Why have they never attack

1685
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
Good

1686
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
University

1687
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,631
Not natural fruit but also

1688
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,959
Like there are people who associate with anti-fascism

1689
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,239
Are capitalist

1690
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,055
There are people who are anti-fascist cleaning who

1691
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:17,152
Are Anarchist or believe that there is a place for the stage

1692
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,944
It's antifashist

1693
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
Feel like he's missing that

1694
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,320
Crucial aspect because I think it's I think it's intention

1695
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:30,720
No you can't be like if antifa wants to be an anarchist group

1696
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
Without immediately stopping and being like

1697
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:37,120
Does the antifa want to be an anarchist did they name themselves

1698
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
Anarchy Anarchy

1699
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
Eastgroup

1700
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,496
Anti-capitalists

1701
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,568
Like sure we can do all of those things but if

1702
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
If you were describing it

1703
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,640
It's called 84

1704
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,968
You can be for capitalism

1705
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,760
Philadelphia

1706
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,576
One might argue that the eventual Road will always

1707
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
Fascism but

1708
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
That's a conversation.

1709
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,160
Different

1710
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
Feel like

1711
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
Prior to becoming a

1712
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,304
Nationalist

1713
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,608
Stefan molyneux

1714
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,656
Spine hanging out with

1715
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:14,240
Anarcho-capitalist

1716
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,312
Anyway

1717
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,384
How many Wall Streets of you f******

1718
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
Occupied

1719
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Dumbshit

1720
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
They ever gone after the Fed

1721
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Wow

1722
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,880
Sure but that was a false flag

1723
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,160
Oh that's true

1724
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
Barnes

1725
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,072
Skedaddles out cuz you got a lawsuit going to work

1726
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,864
So Alex Goes to call

1727
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,424
And just call her

1728
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
This little 10 sec

1729
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,472
Can clip is perfect

1730
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:52,384
Booster shots Ruby patches micro glass that goes in your skin so they can track you if you know that

1731
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,944
No but I

1732
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,736
I mean I believe anything now and I just

1733
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:01,088
PSU will oh no no no

1734
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:07,232
That was a perfect moment Alex says something like I didn't believe anything

1735
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,536
Yeah that will do will believe anything

1736
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,584
Do you listen to this b*******

1737
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
Yeah

1738
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,448
Um probably run and win office as a Republican

1739
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,752
If your if your slogan was just

1740
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,568
You'll believe any old should I say

1741
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,896
Call God if you did something that would be like

1742
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
Universally

1743
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
Decried as offensive and horrible

1744
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,600
I'm going to run for office

1745
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,136
But I'm never going to wear

1746
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,352
I'm not a shirt guy

1747
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,936
I say it like it is

1748
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:52,800
If you're really confident about it I bet you could win on a Gob probably

1749
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Yeah

1750
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Yeah

1751
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
Cuz they just don't

1752
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
F****** care

1753
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
They don't act

1754
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Suggest

1755
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
Hate the left

1756
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
I stick it to the libs

1757
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:07,136
But I insist on every public appearance that I have I'm wearing a snake on my neck

1758
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,160
Here's what we got

1759
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
You want to stick it to the libs

1760
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,720
You go with me

1761
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
Shirt or no

1762
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:17,120
Would you want to not stick it to lose you vote for one of those other assholes over there they're not going to stick it to the lips

1763
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Now probably wearing

1764
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,168
Suit

1765
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,472
No shirt no shoes no service

1766
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,800
Nolibs is what it is no shirt no shoes or lips

1767
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,592
No shirt no shoes no

1768
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
Make ramen.

1769
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,480
Landslide

1770
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,808
Alex has been having a good time on this side this episode but

1771
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:36,832
We kind of sucked up

1772
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,672
He went to play a bunch of videos of antifa pretending

1773
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,488
Bixby cops sure sure that sounds right

1774
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
I'm sorry antifa pretend

1775
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,632
I really want to spend a half hour today

1776
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
I never bother you

1777
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
Going crazy I'm about to play a few of the clubs but I'll just have to

1778
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:04,224
Winter stories and I've been doing pretty good job

1779
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
They want the shutdown

1780
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,928
Economy under going to use

1781
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,232
The cover for the collapse and then blame that

1782
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,024
Raipur

1783
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:20,096
Wait what

1784
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,424
Martial law

1785
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:31,104
But your calls are actually a lot about that

1786
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,664
Research

1787
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,760
Today

1788
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,064
Wow

1789
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,856
That's difficult to follow just

1790
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
As ideas

1791
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:50,560
I guess you really take issue with his the idea that obviously there's going to be a global collapse

1792
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,608
Calming natural in order to

1793
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:55,424
To make sure the bankers don't get blamed for the global collectors

1794
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,984
But your calls are more important naturally

1795
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,008
Absolutely

1796
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:04,640
If I were a color I would take issue with that I just don't even I don't even know how to hear him

1797
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:08,992
Just saying words that's exactly what I

1798
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:14,112
Like when he's when you're following along with what he thinks is supposed to happen it what

1799
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,184
Certain is supposed to happen everything he's doing

1800
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,208
It is insane

1801
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,256
It is an insane person

1802
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,328
But that's what I'm saying is this real or fake it doesn't matter

1803
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,120
If you believe this stuff is crazy

1804
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:28,448
He doesn't believe this stuff he's made me more insane

1805
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
So Alex does end up playing

1806
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,640
Some videos of antifa acting like cops either

1807
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,456
Major I didn't want the audio

1808
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,504
And this is a surreal thing if

1809
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,552
You are just listening to the audio

1810
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Because

1811
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
You can't see what

1812
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,648
The on the video and he does

1813
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Say like

1814
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:53,024
He doesn't narrate the deal at all. Kind of bumbles

1815
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
About violence

1816
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,096
And it's very upsetting

1817
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,704
Watching stopping

1818
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Renata just beating people up

1819
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,800
People I mean

1820
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
Unless it's just trash

1821
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
I'm sorry man

1822
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,208
Reflect your throat

1823
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
Johnny

1824
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
Are you sure you don't want to file a lot of that around like a real problem

1825
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,104
You want to punch my buttons be five or six people Center

1826
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,552
When the big

1827
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,488
What's the weather

1828
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
I just destroy each person Awana time

1829
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
Whoa

1830
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
Okay

1831
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,200
Is gone in a Direction

1832
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:19,040
Yeah that's not good you go to Family Court

1833
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:32,096
Self-esteem whatsoever is in the only way I know how to express that it's through fantasies of viola

1834
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:38,496
Plants which makes me a healthy person is everything kosher my audience that it's easy to kill people

1835
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
Is that cuz I'm a man

1836
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,360
No I don't have a governor I would not like

1837
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
To see this kind of conversation on any program

1838
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
Like any program that

1839
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,296
Trying to be political or talk about issues

1840
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,368
Mumbling about murdering people is just

1841
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Goof

1842
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,928
Whoever

1843
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,488
I've been what lawyer was it that

1844
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,024
Made it so that they could

1845
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Didn't show

1846
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,072
Clips of his show

1847
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:06,656
Barnes

1848
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,936
Cuz whoever did that

1849
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,704
Man

1850
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,008
Imagine just going to Family Court

1851
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
I'm just being like hey

1852
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:14,592
After we went to Family Court last time

1853
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:20,992
I'm going to play this clip of aleksandr show it's very easy to kill I do not have a governor

1854
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:26,880
Most people think it's hard to cover themselves on the other hand

1855
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,512
Use with murder could we please keep this man as far away from us

1856
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
Possible

1857
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,816
Of course

1858
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:38,912
Simon says something about murder that I actually kind of think is

1859
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
I mean it's not news

1860
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,408
Young

1861
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,504
I know why you have that Intuit

1862
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
No

1863
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:06,560
I think we know that and we have known that for a long time well aware of it kind of been the whole thing

1864
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,864
About you

1865
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
Types Alex's that you

1866
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,704
Very clearly want to kill us

1867
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
Won't stop talking about

1868
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,800
In Injustice

1869
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:21,408
Just amazing how in a very short. Of time you can save

1870
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,712
Trash

1871
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,272
Obviously I could kill

1872
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
And I want to

1873
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:32,416
And I don't know cuz I know you do too and you could do

1874
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:35,232
That's the problem that's the problem

1875
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,816
Obviously I have no Governor or immoral

1876
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Said him and I'm willing to kill despite being

1877
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
A Christian

1878
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,264
I am ready and willing to kill with no Governor I have no governor and the left

1879
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
Think

1880
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
That they're all safe

1881
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:54,176
The veneer of our politeness and murdering is starting to slip

1882
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:54,944
Yeah buddy

1883
01:29:55,456 --> 01:30:00,320
It slipped while ago remember when you stormed the goddamn capital

1884
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,136
Are the United right Rally or

1885
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,464
All the murders you guys do

1886
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,024
Cooking burgers

1887
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Talks

1888
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Yeah

1889
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,352
Yeah that f****** psycho

1890
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:16,448
We want last clip here and take the call

1891
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
And I just

1892
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,288
Want to play this because I think it's unhinged

1893
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,336
One I was going to

1894
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,128
See if you could like

1895
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,664
Hold a call in

1896
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,968

Time in H

1898

4

1899
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:37,952
Like on Sunday or Sunday night or something like that

1900
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,840
Power Sunday

1901
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,424
Dedicated

1902
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
You're right

1903
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Thank you thank you

1905
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
And I prayed right along with you on that

1906
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Prayer B

1907
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,480
Yeah I think our prayers got Trump elected

1908
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
This is just like this is great

1909
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,856
If I were out I'd be so pumped about something like this Wednesday

1910
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,160
Okay the audience is starting to suggest

1911
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,952
Did I become a televangelist

1912
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:16,608
Yeah I can make this transition work is just push a little bit if I can have a proof-of-concept

1913
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,704
Where I start doing shows that are entirely she or religious

1914
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,520
I can make that profitable

1915
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,312
I can stop this whole bulshit

1916
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:28,896
Man I can stop doing things that are going to get be sued all the

1917
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,712
Hi hi just want to scream at the

1918
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
These people I don't

1919
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:37,088
Why would I wish I wish I did not have any

1920
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,880
No biblical education

1921
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,160
I just ate

1922
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:43,488
Drives me insane like I was hammered into me so much

1923
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
Sofa

1924
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Talking much

1925
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Now that the idea of

1926
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,936
These people saying oh we're so f****** Christian in the left is evil and immoral and ship

1927
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,728
Read your goddamn Bible

1928
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,288
Do you imagine can you imagine Jesus

1929
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
Woodfield

1930
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:03,456
It's an if you made money off of praying to him

1931
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:08,064
Hour-long show just about prayer for you and then he's going to plug in the

1932
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,160
God dammit

1933
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
You're going to tell me your Christian

1934
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
The s***

1935
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,536
Play Smite the globe

1936
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
Dammit

1937
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,584
I hate this f******

1938
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
Please

1939
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,888
Smite my enemies

1940
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Amen

1941
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:28,288
Also. I should tell you it's 45% off

1942
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,104
All these bodies on the real

1943
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,384
The real

1944
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,456
It is just it's just sitting there and I see some

1945
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,992
Yeah I think

1946
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:40,320
I think it would introduce a difficulty for me in terms of like

1947
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
If you're sure when

1948
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
It's full televangelist

1949
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,464
Google having me here no I think I'd have to keep

1950
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Doing it

1951
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,304
Right I have to keep following the show

1952
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,144
It's a new frontier for us

1953
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,984
I don't think they necessarily that's where he's going although I do think it would be a

1954
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Smart decision

1955
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,800
Probably just why whenever they're sort of

1956
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
Indications of

1957
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,872
An instinct to go that way though

1958
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,968
Take that off ramp man probably smart

1959
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,552
You can survive these cases that you're in the middle of now

1960
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,856
Televangelism

1961
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
Your golden

1962
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,928
The speaker's been scamming for

1963
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,952
Decade

1964
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:22,816
Prison. Even trying

1965
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584

Went to prison in just smoothly walked back into it he has a compound in the Ozarks

1967
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:34,592
Everybody no one talks about it into the middle of nowhere

1968
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:39,456
Jim Bakker survival food he owns people who live in is Campo

1969
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:44,320
That's real he can tell them what to do whenever he wants

1970
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
Oh my

1971
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,112
My God

1972
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
The hammock retirement

1973
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,232
It heads like Alex a Dream Most

1974
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:56,096
I thought this was fun if only because you know this

1975
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Study was

1976
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
Just at Justice

1977
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,400
Travesty

1978
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,936
Of Alex

1979
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,728
Just being unable to

1980
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:07,872
Yeah deal with any kind of source material that wasn't even rejected that was lit on fire before he even had

1981
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
The Chancery

1982
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,456

Full circle there was a narrative

1986
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:22,208
Through line and you close it out

1987
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:28,352
What's wrong with spouse Mouse
