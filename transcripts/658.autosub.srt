00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
The altar of Celine and talk a little bit about

8
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
Alex Jones

9
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
I have a quick question

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
What's up

11
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008

Going around

14
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
On the Infowars webs

15
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
Believe it was

16
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
The Bandit

17
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,272
And periodically you'll see some fun advertising

18
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
That's on there

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
And there's a new one

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,136
Which I will post a picture of this ad

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
On Twitter but it's

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
A picture of Alex doing the Uncle Sam

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Going to pick up the camera tax relief get the number one tax

24

You saw that I just like

26
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
So great

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
Half of his career has been talkin about how the 16th Amendment

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
It doesn't exist it wasn't ratified

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
Can't be happy

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
With Infowars branded comply

31
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Really hear about Irwin Schiff if he's running this time

32
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
A relief hotline

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
Joe Bannister

34
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,192
Beckman Murfreesboro f****** old-school weirdos

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Leaving Centerpoint. Where it's like

00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:23,616
Have you had a personal injury Infowars says go to you know it's a were there

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Yeah

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Yeah

39
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
That is actually like

40
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
I thought I would find that more acceptable people

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
Vetro haven't spent most of his career railing against like

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Have you been busy of personal injury suits or something

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
You shouldn't believe that I don't want to pay taxes why you having a tax settlement first

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
My bright spot Dan

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Is baseball

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Going to happen

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,056
Going to do it okay they're going to they're going to have today

48
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
They're going to do it nothing great

49
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Maghrib today

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
2/2

51
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
The Baseballs the new play 460 I didn't even know there was a problem with Facebook

52
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Has not been happening for almost 100 days

53
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,464
Isn't that the offseason though yeah but even during the offseason you still do so

54
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,120
You throw the ball Camp none of it

55
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Nobody got paid

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Nothing

57
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,752
Is brutal all because the owners were like what if

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
And I'm

59
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Throw this out there

60
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
We could negotiate with the Union

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
What if we broke

62
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
The union beneath our heels in Smash

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Their teeth

64
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Grind up

65
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
How old are so weak

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Power armor

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
F****** penis

68
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
That seems like coming to be more

69
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
Yeah and they almost did it

70
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,120
CLA convey in the mix man I hate themselves

71
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Nobody ever in history of the world is the rickets are here ever never there

72
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
They're like a tubal

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah it's

74
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
It's like the reverse of that weatherman

75
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,600
Tom what does negative

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Everybody says everything negative about the eclipse

77
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
Congratulations on getting your baseball

78
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
We have an episode to go over give me jumping around a little bit throughout time and the reason

79
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Is because

80
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
By Kurt Vonnegut

81
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
Exactly it's these

82
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Spiritual sequel to momento

83
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
So

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
Taylor Green's been making more appearances on Infowars

85
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
And I believe this to be

86
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
B A troubling

87
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Where else would you find a shrieking harpy

88
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
Probably some other places but

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Well

90
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Not so much a media Outlet

91
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,367
So yeah we're going to talk a little bit about that but before we do

92
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
Let's say hello to

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,303
The great idea superstreets Roper's blue comb

94
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703

00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,639
Pics of weird I listen to you and I kind of do to thank you so much

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,063
Termites

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
I'm a policy wonk don't you f*** with DJ Danica I'm telling you

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
Thank you very much

99
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
I hear from some people that they

100
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
Speed up and listen to the podcast and like

101
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119
Look there's something about a timing you know like

102
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
Really kind of

103
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
Comedian it is

104
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,895
Kind of an important thing that we care about is almost unfathomable to me

105
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
I guess if you like doing that do you think

106
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Next number one

107
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,303
Thank you so much,

108
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
I'm a policy wonk I have

109
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Risen above

110
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
A little breaking for me

111
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
And then we're going

112
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
To come back

113
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
And I'm going to start the show over

114
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
F*** you

115
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
F*** you

116
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
I got plenty of words for you but

117
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
At the end of the day

118
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
F*** you and your new world order

119
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Bucking horse you rode in on

120
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
And all your s***

121
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Maybe today

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

123
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

124
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And you never see me again

125
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Really what I want to do

126
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Come back here again

127
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
I apologize to the crew in The Listener jester

128
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

129
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
I'll be better tomorrow

130
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,231
Tomorrow they're bad

131
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
It's definitely

132
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
For concern

133
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Repair

134
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
The relationship

135
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
It's growing between Infowars and Marjorie Taylor Greene

136
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
They're becoming a bit more in

137
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
French then you might have expect

138
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
Did the taste of beer or

139
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
I could have predicted

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
Green appeared on Alex's February 2nd show and we discussed that appearance but

141
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Connor further interaction

142
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
Invading Ukraine thing definitely seems like a more relevant topic

143
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
Take the cover but now that Alex is kind of settled into his

144
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,495
Very transparent status quo cuz I big booty while pretending he's just looking at all sides

145
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
We have an opportunity to go back in

146
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Can fill in some gaps

147
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
From things that we missed along the way

148
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,479
Order initial appearance Alex mention that he's excited to meet Marjorie in person and as it turned out

149
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
He didn't have to wait all that long

150
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,367
And she ended up making her first in-studio appearance on February 20th

151
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Which is where we're going to begin our episode today

152
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
Screen doesn't show up until the 2nd hour

153
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Of this Sunday episode but

154
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
If you take the time to listen to the

155
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Beginning of it

156
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
You'll notice that Alex's pop story is not one

157
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
It looks great in hindsight

158
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Marijuana

159
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Europe

160
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Northeastern Europe

00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Crane with her soulmate

162
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Foxy War

163
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
Between the globalist

164
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Russian

165
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
Here's are some of the headlines Russia plants big

166
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Biggest war

167
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
19:45 says the British

168
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Globalist

169
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Who knows it might be true

170
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
Russian troops receive orders to proceed with Invasion USA

171
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Intelligent shows

172
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
The same us intelligence

173
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
Kind of brazen wire that Alex is

174
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
He specifically casting doubt on assessments

175
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,343
That Russia was going to invade Ukraine is February 20th show

176
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
Bad and I think a lot of people would have said similar things

177
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Problem is

178
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Just a few days after this

179
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,399
He decides to put together a compilation of dumb clips

180
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
He's pretending he predicted the invasion

181
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Back in August

182
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
2021

183
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
This is Central to one of Alex's deception

184
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Games

185
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Key to getting what's going on

186
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,527
On February 20th is probably aware that he'd made a prediction that there would be War by February

187
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:05,439
You swear that he yelling about war being imminent for a while but he also knew that he been saying it was going to be a war with

188
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
China

189
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
So there's news coming out about the possibility of Russia being involved in a war

190
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
At what house is looking for

191
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
No

192
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Alex Lopez booty

193
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,239
And hates the United States government took an agency within the US government to save the food

194
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Was going to invade Ukraine

195
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,615
Of course that's not true and now it's a supposed predict prediction isn't even a factor

196
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Doesn't

197
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
It doesn't come into his mind

198
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
13 actual Invasion calculation

199
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
The prediction of war with China dematerialized

200
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Is close enough for him to use

201
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
This is what he was talking about the whole time

202
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
We hurt we heard how in the

203
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Is compilation he used

204
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
The clip from last November where he

205
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,399
Headed out the part where he said that he didn't think Russia was going to invade Ukraine

206
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,471
Here you see that same mentality stealing place on

207
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
February

208
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
20th

209
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
At the core of things Alex's just a mod

210
00:10:54,335 --> 00:11:00,479
He legit Amelia's willing to say whatever feels good to him in the moment he's more than willing to lie about the world and his path

211
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Bass positions

212
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Lanterns a very serious topic

213
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Sex even including the invasion of a country

214
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
If there's a chance that doing so will increase his status

215
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
And make him a few bucks

216
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Ratatouille sucks

217
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Right right

218
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
It is

219
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Important

220
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
To remember

221
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Do you know like the noble truths

222
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Like life is supper

223
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
That's a really important

224
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
What people

225
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Forgot and what God, wasn't even

226
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Really thinking of

227
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Was that if

228
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Life is suffering

229
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
You should

230
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
Therefore be able to make money off because there's nothing you can do baby

231
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,343
Come on

232
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Also if there's one

233
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Problem with katanas conception

234
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
It's the idea that when you die you just

235
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Play a harp

236
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
I was so mad whenever I read that

237
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Like I mentioned

238
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,287
Marjorie Taylor Greene the parents here on the show

239
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
I want to give a bit of a

240
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Content warning

241
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
The generally goes over I would say a lot of

242
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Of this episode

243
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
It's going to pop in and out there or not it's not the sole topic

244
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
It's going to be covered but

245
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,255
There's a great deal of transfobia that's going to be emanating from Alex and Marjorie Taylor Greene

246
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
And I hope that we can

247
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
Discuss this into the sensitivity that is appropriate

248
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Nam and is it something that

249
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
You do you find

250
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Objectionable

251
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
You might want to

252
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
TuneIn on Monday

253
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Yeah cuz there might be some stuff

254
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Knock knock

255
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Not so great

256
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
I tried to not put anything

257
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
And you know that's just

258
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Gross for

259
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Pacheco

260
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
It being gross

261
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
But

262
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Some things are unavoidable

263
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Yep

264
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
So Alex

265
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Starts to introduce Marjorie

266
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
And

267
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
He gives his normal speed about how like

268
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Celebrities male

269
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,543
Well I could care less about Hollywood stars I could care less about Paula

270
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
About anybody but my family and

271
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Other hard-charging

272
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Excited

273
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Down

274
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Before she got

275
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Extremely

276
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Excited to have

277
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
MTG

278
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Marjorie Taylor

279
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
From Georgia

280
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
District

281
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Weather Friday

282
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Greatpeople

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Have you good people in Congress

284
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
She's probably my favorite

285
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
But I tell you

286
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
She is just the most

287
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
System coming after her

288
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
This is so funny Paul is the son of anti-communism royalty and Alex's favorite politician of all time

289
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Who actually come on Alex's dumb show

290
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,671
As someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene gives him a second of attention saw like Rand

291
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Who

292
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Yeah that's

293
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
That's very sad

294
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Alex's show over the years

295
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
There was at least once at one point the pretense of being about principal on the issues where is the Temps

296
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
The hijack people's attention

297
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Do some trolling and then talk about meme s***

298
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
How do you Sue at least pretended

299
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Discuss documents

300
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Wheats or sub stack

301
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
The people write F don't mean anything

302
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,951
How to set up guest wedding air of seriousness around then whether or not they actually were but people like Webster

303
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
Guitar player G Edward Griffin

304
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,119
But it wasn't so long ago that they were replaced by people that Carpe donktum Linda Mike cernovich

305
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Alex Beverly Headley

306
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
True depth of the stuff he was saying and covering but

307
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
He was earlier career there was at least an expectation that he

308
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
At this point the cultural landscape has changed enough

309
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
There's no real point in pretending

310
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,735
And now it's good enough just to do the troll s*** and pretend that that is itself Subs

311
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Well I mean

312
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Are you kidding

313
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Say that it's gone downhill

314
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
Or you could say that it's

315
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,999
The modern Algonquin Round Table sure so I mean they're The Luminaries

316
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
In their individual field

317
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,631
Dorothy Parker she is not Marjorie Taylor Greene

318
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Anyway that brings us to Marjorie Taylor Greene popping onto the show

319
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
She's fairly popular witch

320
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Clearly extreme right-wing politics

321
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
The only reason with Alex's any interest

322
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
She's actually desperate enough for it

323
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
She's willing to be on Infowars

324
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
There's a pretty good

325
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
Good chance that she's going to retake her seat in the 2022 midterm election

326
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,183
Just have to do with the inherent

327
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Advantage of

328
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Incumbency

329
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,327
She's a really f***** up person who's willing to give speeches at Nick Fuentes political

330
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,143
Conference to make regular appearances on Infowars

331
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
In the position of being someone with a bit of a

332
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,007
Constituent constituency seal

333
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,919
Well it is true that the GOP is drifted closer to their brand of insanity in the past

334
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
In terms of a potential GOP Primary

335
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,807
She's ever up against a really strong candidate who doesn't tolerate with Nazis

336
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Or if she's up against like

337
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
The grand

338
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Dragon of the KKK

339
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
You know like that she can go I can go

340
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:07,167
Way to Dolores and everybody's like well why we even bother with her

341
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,239
Is the grand dragon by actually I think you're wrong

342
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,383
If the Grand Dragon of the KKK was in the GOP Primary against her

343
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,991
A third person would win because they would split the vote

344
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Yeah that would be the misogynist racist

345
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:29,695
And the non misogynism that is under her constituency ceiling

346
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,047
And that would be problems in the GOP candidate would probably

347
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Just get everyone else

348
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
And that would be the grand wizard

349
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,519
The two of the Grand Dragon on Grand River

350
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
Marjorie a the proceeding

351
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Global Awakening

352
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Against the people and I said

353
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
What do you want

354
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
On my list

355
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
A my list was in this

356
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Synced up

357
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Right now so

358
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Vanoss

359
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Send text message

360
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Studio

361
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
I'm so happy to be here with you Alex

362
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Some of the most

363
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Yes I can do so I'm so high

364
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Happy that I'm here

365
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,383
Maybe some exciting interview for her cuz she can just talk s*** in

366
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
And speak freely

367
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,759
Other interviewers are probably pushed back on completely insane things you might say but Alex's

368
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Just let that s*** slide and then try and outdo her

369
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,415
Bigotry is on the table stupid conspiracy theories are treated like serious concern

370
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
It's much more fun

371
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,535
Been being on CNN for some reason bigoted and really loved stupid conspiracy

372
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
You don't have to hold back I know nobody's going to be like

373
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,055
Children to Cthulhu and you'll be like look like I never said that I'll tell Tera Coca

374
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Cthulhu positive conference

375
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Because I didn't know anything really that you say that's a negative

376
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Paddock

377
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
It's like you're already on Infowars

378
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
What what

379
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Anyway

380
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,791
Marjorie Taylor Greene congress not too long ago

381
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
And you might be surprised to learn that she was surprised about something

382
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Call yeah

383
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
B l u

384
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
For me what I see

385
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
And I'm just a regular person I've never been in politics

386
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,359
And going to Washington the most disturbing thing that I

387
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
The people in Washington

388
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
And it's his tiny little world

389
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
If you really look at it

390
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
It's a small percentage of people

391
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
But they truly look down on the rest of America

392
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
And they sing

393
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
But everything they

394
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Think in their little bubble

395
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
And what they want for our country is

396
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
The most important thing

397
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Look down on the common

398
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
American man and woman

399
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
And they

400
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Don't care if their sodas

401
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Disconnected

402
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,591
Wow that's really profound how the thing that Marjorie learned what you went to Washington is literally the most obvious

403
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,991
Complaint that everyone has about Washington any complaint more obvious

404
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
They're not in touch with the Working Man

405
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
She's so unlike these cloistered Washington bubble beings and you would think that our legislative history of all kinds of important

406
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,583
Bill's really help the people who she represents

407
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
It certainly wouldn't be a bunch of s*** that's essentially just playing Washington politics games and appealing to right-wing media entities

408
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
I was going to put this up.

409
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
It looks like she's introduced 18 bills in Italian she's been in office

410
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
Expelling Maxine Waters from the house and her committee

411
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
Didn't go well.

412
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
Open Arms about water saying people that stay in the street and protest

413
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,815
Through the Chauvin trial

414
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,911
Play something it's super relevant to the constituents in Georgia's 14th

415
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,495
Whether or not a congressperson from California keeps her committee assignment

416
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:00,127
That's definitely not just a desperate ploy to ride the wave of right-wing media attention and get a little bit of yourself

417
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
I know

418
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Both of them died in

419
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
She also introduced for bills

420
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
Joe Biden

421
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Do you know they didn't go well

422
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,695
I guess it's a little more relevant to Georgia voters

423
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Georgia is in the United States

424
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Like it's a little much

425
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
Maybe looks like she also introduced a number bills are obviously going to die in committee but had names over his perfect for folks in the

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Stuff like that

427
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
The Wii will not comply Act

428
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,127
Probably got a law that

429
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,015
It's called we will not comply otherwise I can't

430
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,463
In November she introduced the bill HR 6070 which was known as the Kyle

431
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Rittenhouse

432
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
Congressional gold medal a

433
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
She wanted to give Rittenhouse a congressional gold medal

434
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
You know that thing that's been awarded to people like Rosa Parks

435
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
Nelson Mandela and Jonas Salk

436
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,847
This seems like something that if I were just regular person living in Rome or Calhoun or Dalton Georgia

437
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
Be pretty interested in my representative taking the time to do that

438
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
That stuff right

439
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Fight my battles for me

440
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
80s like

441
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
The people in Washington

442
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
I just disconnect

443
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
And all they want to do

444
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,159
Is give gold medals to murderer

445
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
You know and it's like

446
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
I know people think that they're that washing

447
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,840
Is working for them but I swear to you all they want to do is give gold medals

448
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
All they want to do is do stuff it's red meat for the right-wing media

449
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
They just love it

450
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Define criticism of Congress to say that Congress members are often two in their own world in a bubble but the reality is the Marjorie Taylor

451
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Evergreen is in a bubble to

452
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
It's a way worse bubble

453
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
It's a bubble where the mechanisms of government really only exist in order to create opportunities to bring yourself more media 10

454
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Nms strengthen your own brand

455
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
It's essentially all marjorie's

456
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
Been doing since he's got into office

457
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,048
Introducing these meeting with bills that are read me for extreme right-wing media

458
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Going on tour with Mac

459
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,936
Gates speaking at Nick Fuentes event now showing up on Alex's show more than once

460
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
The normal Congressional person

461
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,544
Bubble maybe an issue because it does keep them

462
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
I'm a bit detached from the larger world

463
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
But Marjorie Taylor Greene bubble essentially only has room in it for herself

464
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Which is a big

465
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
She's in a bubble

466
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Created by

467
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
Delirium from the Sandman

468
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
It's like we're at we have to go

469
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
Downright mythical

470
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
To get to the level of weird-ass bubble sheets

471
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
I got really lost their cuz I thought you were saying that like reading the same and Comics gives 1/2 l

472
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
The endless

473
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
Washington

474
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Care about important things like

475
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
Canadian truck

476
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
So disconnected

477
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
That's why all they want is like war in Ukraine

478
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Instead of even

479
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
I'm thinking about

480
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
Truckers Who deliver food and supplies

481
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
They don't even care about kids wearing masks they don't care about our border with

482
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
Fentanyl pouring across

483
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,024
Killing young people and being the number one cause of death

484
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Not covid-19

485
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
And it just bothers me so much babe

486
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Play treat me

487
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Some kind of

488
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Happy person

489
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
I feel like

490
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,616
People who the guy you're talking to someone who talks about the people having horns

491
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
Being a demon

492
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
String of words

493
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
Meant to appeal to a far-right base but

494
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
What's the relationship between any of these thoughts

495
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,976
You can see that there isn't any because right-wing media training is essentially

496
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
That cram it into the sentence

497
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,192
It doesn't matter what your sentence is about cram a little aside in there that's like

498
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,080
And Democrats kill everybody so that then then get to gas prices

499
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
I guess is up by 5

500
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Kind of like a

501
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
Poorly executed debate

502
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Strategy to make a bunch of points

503
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,856
As quick as you can it's just this.

504
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
Also fentanyl is absolutely not the number one cause of death

505
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Summer Country

506
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Even with covid that owner still ghost

507
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Heart disease

508
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
The cancer coming

509
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
And second

510
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
In 2020 700,000 people died

511
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah it's

512
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,264
Names of the number one cause of death of Americans aged 18 to 45

513
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,616
Which is a problem but ultimately she doesn't have a solution

514
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
Or the Border or something

515
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,040
If you wanted to make a concrete difference in this area she would support safe access to drug sampling and test strips

516
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
So people can know if the drugs that they're using contain Fenton

517
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
This would be ultimately unacceptable to someone like Marjorie though because it would be tacitly accepting the reality that some

518
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
People do drugs

519
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
You can't have that

520
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,192
Same thing with like safe needle programs in the right-wing opposition to that s***

521
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Okay so you think this is

522
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
You think this is a bad idea

523
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,872
We never tried to limit the supply of drugs

524
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Is coming in

525
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Because

526
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
If you limit the supply then people won't get it

527
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,528
So all you have to do is close up those borders

528
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
And there's no way

529
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
That drugs will find their way into this country

530
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
It's just like

531
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
Whenever we prohibited alcohol

532
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
Nobody got alcohol into this country not one-time totally worth it was a 100% effective

533
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,216
I don't know why anybody stopping terrible idea

534
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Alex Alex

535
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
Do you recall from Alex's shirt

536
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Of the presidents

537
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,432
Yeah one of the things that was glaring at it was it for some reason Teddy Roosevelt

538
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
At 8

539
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
But nondescript

540
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
Non-random

541
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Call Bland face

542
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
He had his own caricature all those in the wrong place in the order

543
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
Is definitely supposed to be Teddy

544
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
That's because of Alex's favorite speech

545
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
The man in the arena speech

546
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
Alex

547
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,776
The highest honor bombardment Evergreen Arena

548
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Congress

549
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,080
Winning by record number

550
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Attacked being

551
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
The woman in the arena.

552
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Roosevelt

553
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
What is that process

554
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
In the last three years is

555
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Stronger.

556
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
The Roosevelt speech was about the man in the arena and it's very specifically not about the woman

557
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
The arena

558
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Literally or metaphorically

559
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,144
Teddy Roosevelt president from 1901 to 1909

560
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Adele 1920

561
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
The ratification of the 19th amend

562
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,848
The first woman was elected to congress in 1960

563
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,200
Hey Rebecca Felton was the first woman in the senate in 1922

564
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
But she was appointed to fill a vacancy and only serve for one day because she was installed as a PR move on the part of the governor

565
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,648
Who is running in the upcoming senate election

566
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
I didn't want to appoint somebody to fill the vacant

567
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,768
But he might lose against

568
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Supremacist

569
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,656
She's remembered as the last slave owner to be in the Senate so that sucks

570
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Yep

571
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,664
I set up to talk about one depressing thing and it turns out we found another

572
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,112
Teddy Roosevelt would come out in favor of women's suffrage in 1912 but the speech that Alex is referring to is 419

573
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Team 10

574
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
So the little incongruous

575
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Betty White

576
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
You know

577
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
There's some deep

578
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Deep lessons

579
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
That you learn

580
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Way to go into

581
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Dan Marjorie has the opposite

582
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
When I got there

583
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
This is what they told me

584
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Marjorie

585
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
That's not how we do things

586
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:29,152
You see they wanted me to come there they want all the new members of Congress to come

587
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
And talk about that

588
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Talk about

589
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Decide taking lunch

590
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Well it just comes gradually

591
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Play from different people

592
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,928
So they have their committees everything

593
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
Setup on committees

594
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
And what you have to do is you have to

595
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,584
The chairman or the leaders of the Committees

596
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Want you to vote

597
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
And that's how you're being a team player and

598
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
That's how you're doing the right

599
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,800
And if you're not doing that then they want to minimize you they want

600
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:02,432
They do not want your bills or your your voice to be

601
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
You know

602
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
You're saying it's not just the Democrats doing this it's a republic

603
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Percent

604
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:14,208
Alex and Marjorie legitimately sound like children having this conversation really surprised that political parties have

605
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
A vested interest in

606
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
Corralling the votes of elected representatives within their parties

607
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
I started a new job

608
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
And this guy

609
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
This guy he was like

610
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
You have to do what I say

611
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,544
Less Direct than

612
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
The boss but

613
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
The coalition

614
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
Is it is it really something that they're going to present to the conspiracy here that political parties derive their power for being able to vote Isabel

615
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
That's essentially how

616
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Democracy works

617
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Honestly this is painful to listen to not only because it's stupid but because it revealed a shocking level of despain.

618
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Marjorie have

619
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
For the people who are listen

620
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
What Marjory is describing is

621
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
Strongarm tactics

622
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,680
Some kind of a weird conspiracy within Washington

623
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Caucus

624
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Martyrs actual

625
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Complaint is it she didn't have the political Capital to

626
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
The dictate the direction of the

627
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
The party in her first term in office

628
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,736
It's really an expression of narcissism and entitlement being disguised as some kind of complaint

629
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
About Party politics

630
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,928
If you have a problem with the gop's use more than welcome to leave the party and become an independent and then she won't have to get all the s*** that

631
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
But she might get if she doesn't want to vote with the party on some important vote

632
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
You can't do that though because the GOP is a very powerful

633
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Fundraising machine

634
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
And without that are next door name

635
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
Should be essentially f***** in any election in odisha

636
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Especially if I fundraising

637
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Machine where to go behind one of her opponents

638
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
What do you hear March

639
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
Greek gyros essentially impetus

640
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,688
Because she doesn't understand how to make things work in government

641
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
She's not willing to

642
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
To figure it out

643
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
Why would you what doing

644
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
This kind of b******* then do doing media spectacles

645
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
Is clearly more profitable for you than cover

646
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,672
Governing is hard

647
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,256
Using your power and your elected influence

648
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
To make money for yourself

649
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Is astonishingly easy

650
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:02,240
You can guide me she's already made a s*** ton of money at the stock market just because she knows it that she's not

651
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,152
I don't know that to be true but I'll take your word erupt

652
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,040
Well I was looking at her primary race in in Georgia

653
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Adidas discrepancy

654
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Between her fundraising and her neck

655
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Closest

656
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Big guy

657
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,744
Weird weird

658
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Weird weird weird

659
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Looks like there's a correlation between how much money you have and then How likely you are to win

660
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,472
And also being part of the political party

661
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
Get lens you a little bit more

662
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Credibility

663
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,128
And such With Envy the fundraising

664
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Apparatus

665
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,944
No and you have a lot more resource

666
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,248
You can hear her literally being like

667
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,600
Ignoring the fact that yes that's why you're part of the Republican Party

668
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Just being like me

669
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
I shouldn't have to

670
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,672
To make trade-offs

671
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:58,048
Nice to get everything I want I want your money I want your power I want your influence and

672
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,376
I want to do whatever the f*** I want to do and you not to Quest

673
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
I want to be able to reject

674
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:08,032
Whatever you bring to the table that I don't want and I walked

675
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
To be able to insist

676
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
You backup everything I want

677
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
To do

678
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,712
All right fine that is an adult

679
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
Great if that's really what

680
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
How you model or that's what you want

681
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Meant to be great

682
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
It's on it's counterproductive

683
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Obviously you wouldn't

684
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
She is

685
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,584
Otherwise you sound like a child

686
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Yes

687
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,216
Take a civics class

688
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
Anything tonight

689
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Be

690
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
Forced to accept publicly the

691
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Rampant narcissism

692
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
What's behind your belly

693
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Interesting question that comes up

694
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
From Alex

695
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Hey Marjorie

696
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Who's Maury

697
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
Alexandria ocasio-cortez

698
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:02,304
Call Mitch McConnell

699
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,656
At such a difficult question for Marjorie Taylor Greene

700
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Who's more evil

701
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Simone biles

702
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Flies first class

703
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Thousand-dollar outfit

704
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
What's his hard-working mom

705
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Verdad

706
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
Is she mad because she admits

707
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Or is somebody like me

708
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Mitch McConnell

709
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Cuz he claims he's with us

710
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Well there's a big

711
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,256
Comparison there I would say ayo

712
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
I see is death

713
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Definitely

714
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
She's a she's again

715
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,120
Start

716
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Can Waze

717
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,472
He's honest about it that she'll tell you

718
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
Where is Mitcham

719
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,776
McConnell he lies to you

720
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
He says he's a republic

721
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
Like an he's the leader in the Senate

722
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Of the Republican Party

723
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
Everybody's married to Elaine Chao

724
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,016
Call record on record

725
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Wow

726
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,928
Second this is really interesting thing for Marjorie to be doing because

727
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
In some ways

728
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,792
Kind of behavior is only really going to drive a further wedge between her and the party

729
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
You seem so frustrated that she isn't in control of

730
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,192
The kind of seems counterproductive because it's Grandma's things may seem

731
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,080
The odds are enough completely insane people like her getting voted into the house to make a coalition

732
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
The chica

733
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
You know used to

734
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Getsway it's

735
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
Kind of low

736
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,480
Being able to actually work together also

737
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,272
Incredibly low

738
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,880
TCU the crazy kook correlation and then you'd be like wait a second that could be cake

739
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
KK and then you like all I get it

740
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,280
And then they're just trolling you they make $1000000

741
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:42,144
I want to die 2021 green tried to start the America First caucus

742
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
Yes but was only able to bring him Paul gosar Matt gaetz and Louis going

743
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,640
Immediately after announcing the faction the GOP leadership Express their strong disapproval of it and the group disbanded

744
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
Most likely because people like Louie gohmert knows where his bread is buttered

745
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,904
Surgery is a little too obvious what they're actually for want to sign up for that

746
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Speaking of making things to offer

747
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:10,048
CVS on their policy platform statement the America First caucus had a section about immigration

748
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
Little bit too

749
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Domino's

750
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
They kept referring to people as quote

751
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
19 6

752
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
55 Emigrant

753
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,056
Which is a dog whistles white nationalist to believe that the Hart Celler Act passed in 1965

754
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
Was Anna Faris blocked

755
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
Diminish the white population

756
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
In the country

757
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,456
By stealthily bringing in non-white immigrants I mean

758
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Just really putting those

759
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Specifics down on

760
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
Paper for pee

761
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
People like Marjorie of big ideas but unfortunately

762
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Timcast awesome

763
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
I can't really help but wait

764
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
So they're big at audience in their statements

765
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
The beliefs

766
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
The whole thing doesn't work

767
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,728
Naturally Marjorie Potenza

768
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
How to position paper

769
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
She took her shot and fail

770
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,176
Because the accumulation of political power when you want to work within and without the established party hierarchy

771
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Complicated

772
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
It takes Precision Tools

773
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
She's just a jackass

774
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
Destroying anything she tries to create

775
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
Outside of publicity

776
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Those

777
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
You don't need a soft touch for

778
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
You need to yell

779
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,744
She could do that fine

780
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
It's not hard

781
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
No

782
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,096
Mitch McConnell's wife

783
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
I'm not sure if she and Mitch are on the Chinese payroll

784
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
Metal how much of that is being said by Marjorie just because

785
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Travis Chinese

786
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
X100pre

787
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
I suspect that

788
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,360
In reality child's family owns a shipping company

789
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Does business in China called

790
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
Though she's not formally connected to the company they stood to gain from foreign policy decisions

791
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
The Trump could make

792
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,856
Let's not forget the truck named Charlie Secretary of Transportation

793
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
That seems almost

794
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,280
If you don't want to touch that part of it because then it looks bad for Trump

795
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
So this seems like a case of racism intersecting with some good old-fashioned

796
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Corruption

797
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
Depicted as proof that someone is a spy for

798
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
A China

799
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,032
Actually is a Chinese spy

800
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,872
A real idiot for making a part of his cabinet

801
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
Sherwood

802
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
That's not impact that though cuz this isn't a realization

803
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
It's mostly just

804
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Racism

805
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Easy to be racist in it

806
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Mitch McConnell doesn't care

807
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Probably not

808
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
What are you talkin about

809
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
McConnell

810
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976
Is s*** in the world

811
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
But the reality is

812
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Marjorie

813
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Believes in the p

814
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Much like a Dusty Rhodes

815
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
People drive me

816
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
I don't like that

817
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
I don't like that I sent back

818
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
You know sometimes I wonder is that too late

819
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
But I don't think

820
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
So hold on to hope

821
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Constantly

822
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,808
Because I do believe in the mirror the American people

823
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
I believe in you

824
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
I know you're for real I know your voting records

825
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328
So we'll get to the greens boating I could but I wanted to bring up something I didn't realize until I was poking around about Marjorie for this episode

826
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,936
Did you know that between May 2021 and January 2020

827
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,544
Marjorie was find at least 34 times for not wearing a mask in the house chamber

828
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
I knew she was find a s*** ton

829
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Did not know is that many times you believe you can find it

830
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,224
At least $78,000 for not wearing a mask over

831
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
With the course of about 27 months

832
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,344
That's approximately three times the per capita annual

833
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
Income for people in her home District Georgia's 14

834
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,000
What an amazingly childish a****** luckily the good news is

835
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,096
Either one no one will ever come to collect it or two it will come out of the

836
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Taxpayers

837
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
Second one 100%

838
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Gun to his head Alex

839
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Couldn't come up with a single vote Marjorie is cast

840
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
He has no idea what a record is like outside of a record of making

841
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
Inflammatory public state

842
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
My son he likes those

843
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Do you remember that time she voted yes

844
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
I remember that one

845
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,296
I was going over to record American Adventures

846
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Everything points to come up

847
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
The first of the

848
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Didn't vote against

849
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
The gop's

850
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
Position then dinner time in Congress so far

851
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
24.2% of the time

852
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,304
Ben-Hur the third most frequent person in the house

853
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Going against their party

854
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
That makes some sense

855
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
But was really wild

856
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Is that if you look at the list

857
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,008
The top 41 of them are all Republicans

858
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
Of course

859
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
It says

860
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
There's chaos in the house for the Republic

861
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,176
I mean they all agree on the big things

862
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
It's like telling people who disagree with them

863
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
And then that causes

864
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,064
The problems cuz on the inside they disagree with each

865
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
So it's like

866
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:22,208
The God I have a constant stream of people that hate outside of their otherwise like

867
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
We just shut off.

868
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
TV around the Senate

869
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
April like 2 weeks

870
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
There would be 22 Republican Senate

871
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
They would have just eating each other

872
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:37,568
N6 new political party

873
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
Medicaid

874
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Amputees

875
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,688
I was I was pretty shocked at that that

876
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
That lack of

877
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,272
Sort of Coalition management

878
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
41

879
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,344
People in the house

880
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,672
But the highest percentage of voting against their party line

881
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,440
All Republic

882
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,072
Nuts I realized that I'd get into her voting record by realize WhatsApp

883
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
I wasn't gonna break up

884
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Pacific

885
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,400
Who cares

886
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
Not at all one of her votes has mattered about any

887
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
A large part of this interview is

888
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
Iraq transphobe

889
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
It's pretty bad

890
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Pretty pretty

891
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
All around

892
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,856
Introduces this next segment here just

893
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
Reading off a laundry list

894
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,232
Deceptive and misrepresented

895
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
Headlines that he's using for the sake

896
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Of spreading

897
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Transphobic narratives

898
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,680
Santa it gets to this clip which is

899
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Is bruised pretty bad

900
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
Fiji is here

901
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Weather

902
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Oh I think

903
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Make it straight

904
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,640
First off

905
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
If I was a parent and my

906
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Had to had to sleep

907
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
Shower in some kind of

908
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
At some summer

909
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,624
Camp that I paid money to send my child to

910
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
And there was a man calling himself a

911
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
A woman sleeping in her cabin

912
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
Showering with her at that guy with

913
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,048
He be in jail

914
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
He would be in jail will first off my husband what Abby

915
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
Beat him into the ground

916
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
And then he be in jail

917
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
But this is exactly how we need

918
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
To stand up against this stuff

919
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:17,152
So one thing that's pretty important to point out here is the story that Marjorie is talking about involved absolutely no wrongdoing

920
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,224
No child was hurt or anything

921
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,552
The entire issue is that one of the counselors at a science camp

922
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
That's a fifth graders went to

923
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Was non-binary

924
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
And use they them pronouns

925
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,816
Business to do with a 5th grade students from Los Alamitos

926
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,168
Is any of the people who participated in Outrage ramps like Marjorie

927
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Took the time to look into this at all

928
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
They can learn a little bit more about this camp and realize that it's

929
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
More or less a luxury camping

930
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Set up

931
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408
When they say that the kids stayed in the cabin with the counselors

932
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,456
It's meant to evoke the idea that they're staying in like

933
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
His tiny Shack

934
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Big buildings

935
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
That has 10 students in bunk beds

936
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,136
And have separate rooms at the counselor stay in

937
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,976
Also eats cabin his 223 private bathrooms and showers

938
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,792
There's no communal shower and going on here at all

939
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Of course

940
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,936
Everything I can tell this started as a local news report from KTLA about two parents who are bad

941
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Debbie School District didn't tell them that someone who worked at the

942
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,544
The camp that their children were sent to

943
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Was non-binary

944
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
And if they'd known they wouldn't have sent their chill

945
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:27,296
From everything I can tell no other parents were upset and I can't find a bunch of other complaints from other parents

946
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Golden to this camp

947
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,904
Kick-off a right-wing media campaign

948
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Skip

949
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,768
The fact that everything was fine at the camp and no child is mistreated leads

950
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
Folks having to show their cards

951
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
It's a little bit too clearly on this one

952
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Nothing happened

953
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:47,008
But tomorrow jury the mere existence of a nonbinary person in proximity to Children is a threat

954
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
Do that child

955
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,592
Because she believes the trans and non-binary people are in

956
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,128
Inherently dangerous to children

957
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:56,479
In the same way that the right-wing Media made that argument over gay people in the 80s

958
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Are black people decades

959
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
Doing the same game

960
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
Over again

961
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Disgusting every time

962
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
Also Marjorie needs to be way more

963
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
Careful with her language

964
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,791
I have no idea how intentional what she said was but at the end of that clip if you

965
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
You just take her words in the context of how she set them

966
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
She's advocating for committing acts of violence

967
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Against trans and non-binary people

968
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,287
He's pretending that it's about people sleeping or showering with these two

969
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,591
But in the case she's talking about

970
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
That didn't

971
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
Happened

972
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,735
The story she's basing her outrage on is just that a nonbinary person was employed

973
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
That's the long and short of it

974
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,903
Is if these people acting the way that they never have

975
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Never will

976
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,767
And frankly wouldn't make any sense at all for anyone

977
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
Then I think we should commit violence against

978
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,607
Won't

979
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,727
Can't and never will should not stop us from continuing to commit violence against

980
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,007
It's just

981
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
It's just a boring

982
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Becomes kind of

983
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Amane sticking

984
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Throughout

985
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,479
Some of the stuff that we're going to be talking about today this this case of that

986
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,319
And it's just all around.

987
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,695
But of course this leads to a conversation about trans people in sports

988
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Cosgray

989
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Here we go with that rate

990
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
And then the men

991
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
This guy

992
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,119
Lea Lea Thompson I'm sorry that

993
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
That's William

994
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
And he's not ashy he's a he

995
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
He should not be

996
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Women's swim

997
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
He did not win whoever came in

998
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Second place

999
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
The real girl in the race

1000
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
He should be

1001
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Thrown out

1002
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Swimming completely

1003
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,111
And I do not care about it shouldn't matter about what they do in their bedroom if they want to wear a dress

1004
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
But what they're doing is they are defeating women

1005
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,207
It's about beating women.

1006
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
That stands up for it and

1007
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
America needs

1008
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
Most Americans agree that this is

1009
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
Ridiculous and I don't know why

1010
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Goes along with the whole pronoun

1011
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
He's in the season that she's in whatever

1012
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
These are men

1013
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,871
We need to call him what they are there men

1014
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
Makes them and he

1015
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,967
And not play the pronoun game anymore

1016
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
And 16

1017
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:17,791
Easy place for people like Alex and Marjorie to hide their hair

1018
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,095
Bigotry coming from a place other than what it is

1019
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Which is just

1020
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,495
I've never once on his show or any like it the conversation about transmitted

1021
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
Abita men's sports

1022
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,223
Cuz it doesn't work for the narrative that they're trying to use it this mask to cover on the same page

1023
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,295
Discussion about unsuccessful trans women athletes because

1024
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
Again that cuts the opposite direction

1025
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Albania be image

1026
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
To look for their propaganda to work

1027
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
If you knew that there are plenty of successful transman athletes competing in men's sports and that many trans women athletes or either just

1028
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
That's okay or

1029
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
Not very dominant in their sport

1030
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,727
Complicate the issue to the point where people like Alex and Marjorie couldn't

1031
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,751
Use it anymore

1032
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,847
Just ignore the other side of the story

1033
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,919
I want to put a fine point on this

1034
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,479
In the way that I mean to be very emphatic

1035
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:14,367
What Marjorie Taylor Greene is doing here isn't making a political statement about trans athletes or anything like it

1036
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,951
He's categorically dismissing the validity of Dreams people's exist

1037
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
Very least she's producing being trans to being a pure purely sexual thing by saying things like whatever you do in your bedroom

1038
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:29,983
This is an unacceptable level of ignorance for a person who's an elected official to have it

1039
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,871
It's particularly relevant for someone like Marjorie because she represents a district in Georgia

1040
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
Which happens to be the state

1041
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,479
With the fourth highest percentage of the population identified as Transit

1042
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
Very relevant

1043
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Constituency

1044
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,039
Probably

1045
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,855
Leo lot more so then whether or not

1046
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
Kyle Rittenhouse gets a gold star from Conger

1047
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,767
Yeah this is this is actually a very destructive thing

1048
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
For her being able to represent

1049
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
The people of Hurst

1050
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Guide mean

1051
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
You know

1052
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
It is

1053
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
It is such that

1054
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
She

1055
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
It's a club

1056
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
And it is

1057
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
F****** discuss

1058
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
That it's it's just like what

1059
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
How

1060
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,295
How why what

1061
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
And it's just

1062
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Like she just gets

1063
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
Personal satisfaction

1064
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
That's it

1065
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
You know

1066
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
Like really at the end of the day

1067
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
She gets nothing more than

1068
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
The personal satisfaction

1069
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Of having herpes

1070
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,983
Because she can get money out of it but she could get money in and any other difference

1071
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
You know you don't have to go to Congress

1072
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
To get money

1073
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
And frankly you don't have to go to Congress today

1074
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,687
Get money for doing that

1075
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
It's just that she

1076
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
F****** hate

1077
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,343
People and then everybody gets so happy for like wow you're so great

1078
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Hating people

1079
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,511
People I think I think a part of it too is signaling to the the folks

1080
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,839
Set of accumulating power which is

1081
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
Engaging in the

1082
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
The communal demonization of

1083
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
The Chosen victim

1084
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,495
Or the Devon herbal group that

1085
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
Bedside the rest of your

1086
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
Group is ostracized

1087
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
And I think that she

1088
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,943
She gets something out of that it being part of

1089
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Signaling

1090
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,271
And make very concrete that she is part of this

1091
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
In group

1092
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
That is doing the

1093
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
The Hating of this vulnerable

1094
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,159
Also Alex

1095
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,487
Had some old talking points he wants to leave back in

1096
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
And now that's

1097
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
It's just grass

1098
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
Women's

1099
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,191
And children

1100
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
Free time

1101
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
The Big Show

1102
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Batman

1103
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Clown outfit is a woman

1104
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
Sorry

1105
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Not a woman

1106
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
This is all

1107
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Very very

1108
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Sexualization

1109
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Little kids

1110
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Who had no

1111
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
G-strings

1112
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
Glitter on their genitals

1113
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
And hugging little kids

1114
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
Naked men

1115
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
This is four years ago in Austin

1116
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
Make naked men

1117
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Literally

1118
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Grabbing show

1119
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
No that's

1120
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Get here

1121
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,031
I can't even understand that

1122
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
But most drag queens aren't trans

1123
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:19,199
Performance art doesn't really correlate with someone's gender identity

1124
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,527
How to do some talking points that are way past their expiration

1125
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
Stop

1126
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,647
I also that video that Alex's describing doesn't

1127
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,975
I've seen the video that he claims the pics that

1128
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,999
Absolutely not what

1129
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Describing

1130
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:39,167
Alex is lying to a member of Congress in an attempt to make them even more radically anti-trans than they already are

1131
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Which is

1132
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Man you know

1133
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
It's like how did we get

1134
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
The other day

1135
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
I saw my neighbor

1136
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
She put

1137
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
A frog

1138
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
A frog

1139
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Holdrege

1140
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,015
Cauldron

1141
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
3 Doors Down

1142
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,159
Immediately felt at Walmart

1143
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,231
Her fault entirely how did we get here

1144
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
It's unfathomable

1145
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
You know what we got to

1146
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
All of the f****** rules

1147
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
Yeah

1148
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
I think that's why I hate

1149
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
I hate this

1150
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
The contact

1151
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
But

1152
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
There's something about it

1153
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
That I think is

1154
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
It would be negligent

1155
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
If we didn't bring it up

1156
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,527
Inasmuch as

1157
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
This is a sitting member

1158
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Congress

1159
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,391
That is actively engaging in this

1160
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
With Alex

1161
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
And

1162
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
It's bad man

1163
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:40,351
Got no a member of Congress is engaging in stochastic terrorism in order to

1164
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
To get trans youth killed

1165
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
So

1166
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,495
Yeah I would say that's the

1167
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
I can't

1168
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Express

1169
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,175
How infantile even these these thoughts

1170
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
The cheese bring to the table are

1171
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
This is such perversion

1172
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,367
But it's also grooming children it's grooming them to believe things that are lies

1173
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
And there

1174
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
Completely wrong

1175
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,487
No children are not born a certain way

1176
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
Thinking there another gender it's there

1177
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,071
Parents that are training them that way

1178
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
It seems mother said

1179
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
I think it's like a handbag

1180
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
They need to have a boy

1181
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
A girl and a trans child

1182
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
Because if there's some kind of

1183
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Hollywood

1184
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
Stars

1185
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Exactly

1186
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
What do you what

1187
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,759
Why did Alex stop himself when he was he was clearly saying the status symbol

1188
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Clearly what he was

1189
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,855
Yeah about to say

1190
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,159
And then changed it to like

1191
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,231
What Hollywood stars do which I assume he means like

1192
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
Paris Hilton having a dog in her purse or something

1193
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
Kids are possibility

1194
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
I suppose

1195
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:52,543
Either either are possible but this is a grotesque

1196
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
Perspective

1197
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
So she also has some complaints

1198
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
About

1199
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
People not

1200
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Stop it

1201
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
This

1202
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Or something

1203
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
I don't really

1204
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,159
This is just

1205
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Just awful

1206
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
Yeah now it's really disturbing but here's what bothers me the most

1207
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Is

1208
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
So many good men

1209
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
They won't

1210
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Say anything

1211
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Stand up and protect

1212
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,751
We want men to real man to stand up and say

1213
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
We're not going to allow you in our daughter's bathroom

1214
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,151
We are going to allow you in our girls cabins at

1215
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
We are going to allow you to be

1216
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,015
Down our women and our daughters

1217
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
But we need the UFC or other.

1218
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Literally

1219
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,815
2 open trans women who competed in MMA professional

1220
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
There was Fallon Fox who retired in 2014 and Alana McLaughlin professional fights

1221
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,543
So far not for the UFC before combat global

1222
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,103
Not a silence B for UFC fights

1223
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,175
Most of them were with the championship Fighting Alliance

1224
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
That is to say that there is not been

1225
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
A trans woman fighter

1226
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Competing in the UFC

1227
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,599
Right but that doesn't mean that they haven't been killed

1228
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
Well I think that I was just lying about how in her last fight before retiring Fallon talks did break her opponent's

1229
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
Skull in the ring

1230
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:22,143
And then he's complaining that with it a 2019 story about the CEDA elata

1231
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,447
Who was a woman fighter in the UK

1232
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
Who competed in the fast

1233
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
Furious fight series

1234
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:32,383
How late is a brain injury

1235
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Text day

1236
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
Her opponent Jamie Morgan is a cyst woman

1237
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,831
How to combining these things in making up details in order to suit his purposes because this is a trans

1238
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,903
Episode he's got going on here with Marjorie Taylor Greene

1239
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,183
And

1240
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
Why not

1241
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Pretend

1242
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
That

1243
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
Hey listen

1244
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
If the enemy

1245
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,399
That you want isn't doing the thing that you need them

1246
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,935
To do in order to make them your enemy

1247
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Just say they are

1248
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
So

1249
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,591
Jump off this this subject

1250
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,919
There's more than it said that is

1251
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Dear God Dax

1252
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,759
Unacceptable

1253
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
Open the

1254
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
Exact same thing

1255
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,903
Play more would really kind of tend to be

1256
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,487
I think it might feel like wallowing around in like them being awful

1257
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
For the sake of

1258
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
Demonstrating the awfulness

1259
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
That's right

1260
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,751
Will jump 22 this where we get back

1261
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
2 Civic

1262
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,335
And at our lack of understanding

1263
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
Someone's like 100

1264
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,735
But here's something that a lot of people don't understand about

1265
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
So most of the bills that get passed

1266
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Our path

1267
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
By Voice vote

1268
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
That is until this year

1269
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,463
And you know everyone remembers the story of me being kicked off

1270
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Committees

1271
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
Not that big of a deal because

1272
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,631
Democrats are in control and Republicans can't really do much on committees anyways when the Democrats

1273
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
Control

1274
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,031
Because that means you know what that means swamp

1275
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
Exactly who I

1276
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,407
They knew that I wasn't going to hand over my

1277
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:17,087
Well nobody wants you looking at the legislation incompatible with getting anything done

1278
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159
The the consequences is virtue it's just

1279
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Stop

1280
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,535
Do you know that you know that you're on the right track when everyone

1281
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
Does not like you

1282
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:32,959
Imagine looking apply that thinking to Osama bin Laden

1283
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Yeah

1284
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
I mean nobody gets more right

1285
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,335
All sorts of

1286
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,407
Negative figures everybody hated Hitler

1287
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
Everybody

1288
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,759
Some of the people who are on Alex's Network might actually

1289
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,831
I think that might be it might actually believe

1290
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:55,487
Marjorie after she lost these committee assignments it don't really matter and it's a badge of honor that you lost them

1291
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,791
Begin with I mean in her defense

1292
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,559
EXO

1293
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
I will say that

1294
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,399
When everybody in the GOP kicked her out those committees

1295
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
Is there has been like

1296
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,727
We are not here for this

1297
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,775
So we can use her

1298
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,079
This is not what

1299
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,175
Start time for someone like this

1300
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,711
But unfortunately

1301
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,295
What do you got understand is when you try to use

1302
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,111
Somebody like this to play a role

1303
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
They will end up attacking you

1304
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
The chair

1305
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,743
Recognizes the congresswoman from Georgia

1306
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:33,375
The weapon the weapon will be turned on you

1307
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,399
The very quick

1308
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
She lost this committee assignment you know what

1309
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,543
Cited meaning should learn how this year government

1310
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
Works

1311
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:45,151
Is Abdul still builds

1312
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,711
And so when I lost my committee's ice

1313
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,735
Sitting on the house

1314
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:50,783
The story

1315
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,343
I started sitting on the house floor and what I wanted to do

1316
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Is Lauren Dupree

1317
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
And so I started watching them.

1318
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
The Bells

1319
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Back and forth

1320
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
And they would

1321
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
The person in the chair

1322
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
Speaker Pelosi

1323
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,375
She would or he whoever it was with a man

1324
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
I had no idea but it usually wasn't Nancy

1325
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
They would ask

1326
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
The Voice vote

1327
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
And so on

1328
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
They debated the bill the Democrats

1329
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
Say yay and then the Republicans on our side

1330
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Woodside

1331
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
And then the person

1332
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,967
Sitting there in the sky

1333
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
The speaker share with the gavel

1334
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Say the bill passed

1335
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
And like 10 members of Congress

1336
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,135
Would have voted

1337
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Insane yes or no

1338
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
I'm not kidding you

1339
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,023
And so what I started doing as I started using floor procedure

1340
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
And I started

1341
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Call boats

1342
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
So they would debate

1343
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
The bill back and forth

1344
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
And then this

1345
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
Person in the chair

1346
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
A speaker mask

1347
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
For whoever it is

1348
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
With

1349
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
The Voice vote

1350
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
And before the bellapass

1351
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Speaker II

1352
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
The recorded vote

1353
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,271
Well that means that all members of Congress had to come in and ask

1354
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,319
Do you see we have a voting card

1355
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,087
And worse

1356
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Supposed to use that it's

1357
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903
Supposed to be an electronic vote

1358
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,231
And it should record all of our boats whether it's yes or no

1359
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
And so I would

1360
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
Would put my

1361
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
We are

1362
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Are supposed to put our card

1363
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
In there

1364
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Push yes no

1365
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
Vanna White is present

1366
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Either yes or no

1367
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
And you should know

1368
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,031
Weather Fresno fence February the house Freedom caucus

1369
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
It's joined in with me

1370
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,871
We have over five

1371
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
500 bill

1372
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
They're on record

1373
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
But you can actually look up

1374
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,015
Any member of Congress you can look up their vote

1375
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
And even CD

1376
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,831
Did they even show up for work that day today

1377
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Actually boat

1378
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,647
Did they vote Yes did they vote no

1379
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
Is there doing it not just a minute

1380
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,767
That is exactly what I'm telling you

1381
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
I mean Ori one could argue that it's a

1382
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
F****** Mass

1383
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Massive government

1384
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:48,543
Stroke and all of these things are negotiated for months in advance

1385
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,895
Time to learn about what it means to be a member of the House of Representatives

1386
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
Is when you're they or anybody

1387
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
Take off your committees

1388
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:01,599
Yeah the time to get down to brass tacks and figure out what you're supposed to be doing

1389
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,695
Marjorie's are real idiot but I guess in the long run on this one who cares

1390
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:12,351
Vote on every measure with call votes because there's so many members that body that if they were going to do it

1391
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,167
Forever and essentially nothing would ever get done

1392
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Conversely with

1393
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,519
Just 100 members the Senate traditionally does do roll call vote

1394
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,543
Formosa orders Abyss

1395
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:28,223
The way things work is that bills are measures a resolution that are most likely to pass or fail or put up to a Voice vote

1396
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
And then it's

1397
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:29,759
It's decided by the

1398
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
People's men call for a rule called

1399
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
So someone can test

1400
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,183
The vote that can be looked at more closely in the house

1401
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,743
Laborious process

1402
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,047
What Marjorie is discussing doing

1403
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
Could have been a problem in earlier days but at this point it's

1404
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,471
More lights just an annoyance

1405
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
About yay or nay

1406
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
Also

1407
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,127
You can go to congress's website and look at the list of roll-call vote in previous session

1408
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Samba Congress

1409
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:02,015
And honestly it doesn't appear that there any more or less of them since Marjorie started doing this

1410
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:06,111
Princeton silver 449 roll-call do to the first session of the press

1411
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
Congress compared to

1412
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,231
705 in the first session of the 114th Congress

1413
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
Which was in 2015

1414
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,839
You can find the voting records for folks in the house

1415
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Spectre

1416
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
She's making an impact

1417
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:23,775
I really don't think Marjorie is having an impact at all these especially not the way she thinks

1418
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:28,639
She is part of that has to be Deuter clear ignorance of how government works as evidence

1419
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:33,247
Bewilderment at the idea of a Voice vote by the idea of

1420
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
People voting present

1421
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
This indicates that she doesn't understand the bodies of

1422
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,183
The Congress and now they need a quorum to carryout business legally

1423
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,279
So if you don't want to take a side but you also want to make sure the vote can happen legally

1424
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
Foolishness to vote present

1425
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Yeah there's other

1426
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
He'll be done in a caseworker

1427
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Congress member has a conflict of interest

1428
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
So they can't vote one way or the other

1429
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,407
If they were to I cannot vote and it leads to a core I'm not being there that

1430
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,687
Effects could be

1431
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,015
Them working in which F-150

1432
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
There's a number of reasons why on my phone

1433
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,999
Basic things before they decide to run for Congress but when it's all about attention and just yelling

1434
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
Why would you

1435
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,607
Why would you care about how to effectively do the job

1436
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,399
You're asking people

1437
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
2

1438
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,727
A public elect you to do

1439
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
It's disgust

1440
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
It really is kind

1441
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Astonishing

1442
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
About that

1443
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
I think back about my

1444
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Civics education in school and it's like

1445
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
Yeah I can

1446
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Can see somebody

1447
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,623
Who at just has my Civics education from school not like learning anything outside

1448
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,207
Going to Congress and being like this isn't how it's supposed to work

1449
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,231
Yes I can

1450
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
Well maybe we should spend more time teaching people how our own f****** government works or or people who want to run

1451
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Should have to take a

1452
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,471
The clubface

1453
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
There should be

1454
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,567
I don't want it to be like a ridiculous

1455
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,103
Bar of Entry I mean obviously

1456
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:09,503
That would work against people who are working people don't need that

1457
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:13,087
In terms of the time commitment that it would take in order to

1458
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
Like

1459
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,183
Can you create an aerostat aerostatic ruling class

1460
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,719
Already have

1461
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,839
I just I I find I find it to be really difficult

1462
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
Think how

1463
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
Can function

1464
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,751
If people like Marjorie you have no idea how any of this stuff work

1465
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Yeah

1466
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,079
The people who get elected

1467
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
It's it's a it's a

1468
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,407
Electing a stick

1469
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,199
Do a wheel conference

1470
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
That works

1471
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,063
No

1472
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,879
But it is it is so counterproductive

1473
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
2

1474
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,951
Cuz she thinks and these Dum Dums think

1475
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,511
But if they go in there and they like disrupted

1476
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
The process

1477
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,119
Right we'll give them more power and bring more attention to the sub

1478
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,447
When in reality when you go in there and you obstruct

1479
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
The process

1480
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,311
That only makes people who have any actual power

1481
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:12,479
Go as far away from this b******* as they can in order to do things in those secret back rooms that you hate so much

1482
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,159
Obviously we're living in a point where the Democrats are in control of the house

1483
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
I am fighting

1484
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Is president

1485
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:26,303
And so the people who may be wield more of the centralized power within the Republican Party

1486
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,375
Obviously don't mind someone who's just

1487
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,423
Meaninglessly obstruction

1488
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
Oh yeah yeah

1489
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,519
Trying to not get anything done

1490
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,823
Hooray

1491
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Your hero

1492
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,895
Anybody else comes into office the house

1493
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Flip Republican

1494
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,991
All of a sudden they try to push an agenda through

1495
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
She becomes

1496
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,087
The problem or Republican

1497
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
Suddenly the

1498
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,207
Chip is a little bit different and your antics

1499
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,999
Anyway you got to give her some money

1500
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Coming after you like

1501
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,631
Need you to win with a record level or they could

1502
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
Remove you from Congress

1503
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,191
When you're such an important

1504
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
Person

1505
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Donate

1506
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
2mt

1507
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
Fiji Water really appreciate you asking that

1508
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
The coast.com

1509
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,895
Supported by Regular People

1510
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,199
I don't take money from lobbyists or pack

1511
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,759
Ntg4 america.com

1512
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
Cloud

1513
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
Here's some of the donors that Marjorie has gotten money from this cycle

1514
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
Breaker on regular regular people

1515
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,631
First event so that probably.

1516
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Broadway

1517
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
On Google

1518
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,311
Money from the house Freedom fund

1519
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
And the Freedom First political action

1520
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,503
Both are regular

1521
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,551
We consider marjorie's larger record

1522
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
In 2021

1523
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:59,487
She probably broke house rules when she appeared in an ad soliciting donations for a group called The stop socialism

1524
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,399
The issue was the candidates and elected officials can solicit donations larger than $5,000 but people can give an unlimited amount

1525
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Faxed

1526
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:10,751
So this was a super unethical thing for her to do

1527
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:17,407
The systems already on ethical like the fundamental system is already on ethical at a certain point

1528
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
Even the Republicans are like Jesus Christ

1529
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
It's already yours scam

1530
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,367
Not only that though at the end of last year when Marjorie is going on tour with Matt gaetz

1531
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
It's part of that was Italy

1532
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:33,279
Organization deep put America First pack

1533
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,375
I completely fell apart because they spent all their money they raised on a tour with

1534
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
Go to the Boston then the pack ended up centrally broke

1535
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
No problem with

1536
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,079
Incredibly Shady campaign-finance stuff is all bulshit

1537
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,943
It's that virtue signaling if I ever side

1538
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,015
It's also like if you understand the funding different

1539
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
Between her and her next

1540
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Closest

1541
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,879
I think it's Jennifer Strahan is the

1542
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
Did the other person running who's closer

1543
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
Sister her it's comical

1544
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,279
The gap between them

1545
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,351
There's no reason anybody analysis audience should be sending her body

1546
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Even if they believe in

1547
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,167
While it's redic

1548
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
This is a

1549
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Totalscan

1550
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Anyway she has an idea though

1551
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
To me you know that

1552
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,127
About the Civil War in the GOP will I fully embrace it

1553
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Because I believe that

1554
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Iron sharpens iron

1555
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
And we need to be the GOP conference actual

1556
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
Something for a change

1557
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Instead of talking

1558
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:32,671
Easy I think Republicans have a job to do and that is to job

1559
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,719
We need to be the American party

1560
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
Not left or right

1561
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
The American party

1562
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,887
So fun how these do Wanna Party that's the American party

1563
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,287
I will say that it happens have literally all of the positions that are miles

1564
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,127
To the right of the current GOP

1565
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
It's not about left or right

1566
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
It's about America where the people who when we go to government we don't know anything about how it works

1567
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,343
We don't

1568
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
No

1569
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,671
We'd know

1570
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
Nothing let's make a party

1571
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,143
Is the last Refuge of the scoundrel but there's an addendum to that

1572
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,983
Early refuge for really lazy con artist

1573
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
That's what's going on

1574
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,895
How do I say that's about as much as their reasoning February 20th episode

1575
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
I will say that I say

1576
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,223
Think of the most relevant element of this is like

1577
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,807
I know that Marjorie was awful

1578
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,903
No that she wasn't of this ill-equipped

1579
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:41,023
When I heard her talk about being surprised by the idea of Voice vote

1580
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
They're not knowing why people vote present

1581
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
Was trouble

1582
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
That's that's a problem

1583
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,471
I'm at a larger problem obviously is

1584
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:54,847
The willingness to be so explicitly and disgustingly transphobic

1585
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
Score

1586
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:03,039
A benign story

1587
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
But nothing happened at teachers

1588
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
0 event

1589
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:10,207
That features only the existence it might as well have been like a

1590
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
Dad

1591
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
I went to a God camp

1592
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
When I was younger

1593
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Right

1594
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,703
I kind of story I wear were people there from mission trip with Kaylee

1595
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,495
And like

1596
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
Make people shower together

1597
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:29,407
Because I was uncomfortable with it and I was made fun of for it right

1598
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
And while we were in the

1599
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,735
Bunks like one of the dudes who is

1600
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
ICarly derf

1601
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,575
College dudes running around naked

1602
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,879
Coolers with a towel

1603
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
Classic

1604
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:46,559
Cisgender good behavior that no Parenthood objective I told that story

1605
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,863
Other people who went to like Kristen campson

1606
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,143
Dates never like

1607
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,703
I can't believe that happened

1608
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:59,103
I went naked around noon ziplining with a f****** Christian band All In

1609
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871
In their 20s

1610
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
Who were Camp counselors and they

1611
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,527
They grabbed me out of bed at like 2 in the morning

1612
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
To go take me to zipline

1613
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,111
No one had a problem with it

1614
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,695
And those are not okay things that happened

1615
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:20,351
Definitely more problematic than the story that Marjorie and Alex

1616
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,399
We're responding to Ryan made

1617
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
A Transformer

1618
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:28,031
Oh yeah I know know if any one of those band members was a vape

1619
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,103
Then it would have been a problem maybe not them though

1620
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:35,967
Well it wasn't the hot issue for the GOP at that point

1621
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
Cab if they were they

1622
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
It would have been tried

1623
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Find

1624
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
So

1625
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,087
While she was in Austin

1626
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
Alex and Marjorie Buckley went to dinner

1627
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,719
And they released a little 6-minute video

1628
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,559
Of him interviewing her I guess about how Nancy Pelosi doesn't wear masks enough

1629
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:57,215
It's a little dumb and honestly there's a feeling of a couple people drinking and then one of them grabbing the camera

1630
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
Say that thing you said so I can record it

1631
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
It's very clunky

1632
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,895
It's a 6-minute video but actually only 2 minutes or Alex talking to Marjorie

1633
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
The other two

1634
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,967
Two-thirds of the video is a compilation of people like

1635
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:13,343
Joe Rogan and Tim pool talking about how right Alex is about everything wow

1636
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:18,463
As if Alex has every reason to assume that having Marjorie Taylor Greene in this video is going to draw eyes to it

1637
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,255
So while he has people's attention to me

1638
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,583
Goal is really to make sure that people know that idiots like Joe and Tim like him

1639
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
Pretty bizarre

1640
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,679
Also Marjorie says that she's going to be starting a podcast

1641
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
And that it's hard

1642
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,031
Possible impressions videos

1643
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
Convey

1644
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,871
One is that a podcast has to be done through Infowars

1645
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
The other

1646
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
Is that Alex desperately wants

1647
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,735
To give that impression too though it's not true

1648
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
I have no idea but I would caution Marjorie against

1649
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
This plan

1650
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,135
Actually doesn't seem to have much to say and I think

1651
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
She did a podcast with over it

1652
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,999
Expose her I don't know how much of an actual committed audio

1653
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
She has

1654
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,423
You have to factor in the reality that most of her audience is probably been outside the normal podcast audience demographics

1655
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
And younger people who support her

1656
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
I don't like Nick Fuentes followers

1657
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:10,175
They look at her is just a useful tool to bring their white identity ideology closer to the mainstream they're not somebody who they would take

1658
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Take the time to listen

1659
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
To that very sad moment when she is like

1660
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,391
What do you mean I'm not a puppet I'm a real boy and they're like oh

1661
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,487
That's nice

1662
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:28,095
You enjoyed our piyo think we like you

1663
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,375
Ruffling their hair

1664
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,239
Also dumb was Marjorie showing up on the War Room to chat with Owen

1665
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,567
Some other dumb things happened over the next days

1666
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
Last bit

1667
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,527
Ananda present-day The Washington Post story came out there

1668
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,599
Someone apart thousand dollars

1669
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,415
Was the worst mistake in American history

1670
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,743
Really wanting to get out of town fast after things

1671
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
Stopped off at the Capitol on January 6th

1672
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,583
Really wild that he would want to do that

1673
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:03,167
Probably just him throwing a temper tantrum because Trump pardon

1674
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Steve Bannon

1675
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,543
I'm selling a parking tickets just good old-fashioned Rodger Stone corruption

1676
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
Play Rodger is decided

1677
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,151
The claim that those videos are deepfakes

1678
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,479
Play by the North Korean

1679
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
Annabelle

1680
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
Disrupt

1681
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:23,135
Yeah King of the Heavenly features of Rodger

1682
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,975
Is really dumb but I guess it's good enough for the importers audience

1683
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
I don't particularly care about what Rodger has

1684
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
How to say anymore if I'm being totally honest

1685
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Tim's really clear to me that the walls

1686
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:38,751
They're closing in around him and that he's going to be increasingly increasingly combative until eventually goes back to

1687
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
The jail

1688
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,151
Really disconcerting how many different groups are there were involved in planning to Riot on January 6th and he was

1689
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
Directly involved

1690
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,991
I think I saw the Riddler in even more about in the future

1691
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:53,087
Yeah Joshua James remember who pled guilty to seditious

1692
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,927
A ain't guess what he was providing security for Rodger Stone on January 5th

1693
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,207
Along with dirt roads.

1694
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,255
Team leader for January 6th Michael Symon

1695
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:06,655
I bet he heard them talking that Rodger was working really closely and even directly with Allie Alexander

1696
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Durant stop the steal stuff

1697
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
I got a permit to hold

1698
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:16,127
What's on the capitol grounds under false pretenses

1699
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,455
Doesn't sound like a problem at all

1700
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,735
The proud boys

1701
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,271
Leadership which just got a wreck

1702
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Texas bid on conspiracy charges

1703
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,367
Related to January 6th and if you read their indictment

1704
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
It's super clear they plan to storm the capital well in advance

1705
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
What does deep connection

1706
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,583
Well-documented plants do what they did on the six

1707
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
But yeah

1708
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,935
My really weird yeah Rodger isn't super guilty

1709
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:46,335
I hear he has some real serious explaining and soul-searching to do but how he's mixed up with all these people are planning to try

1710
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
Overthrow the government

1711
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
No idea

1712
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
We're up to

1713
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:53,247
I'm looking forward to the moment in court where the defense lawyer is like

1714
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:58,367
I would like to remind everybody we have a presumption of innocence in this country and then everybody in court laugh

1715
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
Come on man

1716
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:08,095
Rodger came around to whine about this article on the post and then try to get the audience to give him more money

1717
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,143
Scrap mechanic

1718
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
Help somebody pee pee

1719
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,775
Marjorie was in person with Alex on February

1720
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
That's because she

1721
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,615
She come to town to support Christian Collins

1722
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:22,175
The GOP Primary for Texas 8th District

1723
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:28,319
I also present

1724
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,903
They were coming in to support this Collins guy in the primary

1725
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,951
And on March 1st Collins loss

1726
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Morgan Luttrell

1727
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,303
We got 52.2% of the vote to Collins's 22

1728
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
Doesn't seem like right there

1729
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
Don't seem like the

1730
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,239
Combined powers of Mike Lindell, Florida and Marjorie Taylor Greene

1731
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,031
Can over overcome a

1732
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,871
30 point loss I mean it's tough when you're behind that far

1733
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Okay

1734
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,479
That far behind because of a k Munoz

1735
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
Why would they come

1736
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,879
The 22 rally for someone who isn't that far behind

1737
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
You wouldn't do that

1738
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,695
No

1739
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:12,095
I think it was close to be the most Greenwood has no stomach in the world

1740
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
Thursday

1741
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
Isabella bunny

1742
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,799
You don't want you don't want to go in like like I'm headlining a rally

1743
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,079
Tragic losses

1744
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
Then on February 25th

1745
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,271
Green was off to Orlando where she spoke at Nick Fuentes is pseudo Klan rally and then it's c-pack the next day

1746
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,087
People were a bit shocked in disillusion by the depths of

1747
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
Ethiopia

1748
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:38,463
Totally fine with somebody associating with somebody who started a propos

1749
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,583
Ain't saying the n word one day

1750
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,655
Remember being welcomed at the biggest GOP event of the year the neck

1751
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,495
This helped to give a little bit more attention to the profoundly hateful things

1752
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,055
Is the Greenwood said on Infowars a week prior to this

1753
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,871
There were a few articles about written about her appearance and

1754
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
It's probably apply

1755
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,199
Add support for violence against trans people

1756
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,015
What group is doing this kind of situation is double.

1757
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:06,879
They recognize that there's a tension in them thar Hills and they get to mining for it immediately

1758
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
Runs largely on

1759
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:16,351
Something the best way to keep that outrage and attention pipeline open is

1760
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,679
Do more of the things that made people angry

1761
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:23,263
Conversely an elected official really as a responsibility

1762
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,567
To carry themselves

1763
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:31,455
So naturally Marjorie decided to double back on out to show on Tuesday March 8th

1764
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
Which is now what we will

1765
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
I'll be getting in

1766
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:40,415
Be mad at her what is she going to lose her election what do you got

1767
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,279
So just to check in here Alex on March 8th is continuing his

1768
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,327
Boy I love poop butt

1769
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,887
I got to say that I see both sides

1770
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,983
Finding Russian position but I understand

1771
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,543
Well-known

1772
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,103
But doing this would make Russian

1773
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
Just say

1774
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,039
But you're not going to bring

1775
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Ukraine

1776
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Hi Joanne.

1777
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
I will not invade

1778
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,439
GameStop

1779
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
Sabotage

1780
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
In the South area

1781
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
The Russia and

1782
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,823
That they overthrew Ukraine

1783
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,223
Stop meddling around in this area that we've seized from you illegally and also

1784
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,063
Say that you're not going to let Ukraine into NATO which

1785
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
ACTA mean

1786
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,159
Germany's chancellor

1787
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,743
Say that prior Terry specifically eyes

1788
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
To keep them from abated

1789
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,327
Yes I mean like this is all the

1790
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,399
Just b******* you just telling the Food Lion

1791
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
I do like

1792
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
How it's a warrant

1793
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
You know it's not

1794
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,615
If you do these things I will invade and murder a lot of people

1795
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,407
For fun

1796
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
And in trash

1797
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,991
That's a warning

1798
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
Definitely not a threat

1799
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,623
So it becomes a good guy he was just warning people

1800
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:21,023
He was just like take watch out there's a car coming and I'm driving it and I'm going to drive through your body

1801
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
Crossword

1802
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:26,399
So we have two big news that Alex is going to go on a little break again

1803
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,959
Schedule right now

1804
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
To California next week

1805
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,543
Really big podcast

1806
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,127
Meaning something

1807
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,711
Guardian of the Galaxy

1808
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,015
Things are so dangerous

1809
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
Not go

1810
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
The situation is

1811
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Titusville

1812
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,447
User user user

1813
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,799
My guess is Russell Brand

1814
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
That would make sense

1815
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,639
He seems like the only person that really fits

1816
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:12,479
This description of being a large platform and someone who'd be stupid enough to let Alex

1817
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,015
Pokemon interview with s*** on challenge

1818
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,831
Tucker's based in New York so it's not him

1819
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,159
I feel like most people in California wouldn't have Alex on

1820
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,231
Jimmy Dore is definitely dumb enough to have Alex on

1821
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:28,607
Possibility that Bill Maher might be craving enough to have him

1822
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:34,751
I wouldn't be surprised

1823
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
It is just so sad

1824
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,871
Break the internet so maybe it's like Kim Kardashian

1825
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:46,527
Or cognac that would break

1826
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
Talk I would watch that

1827
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,671
And I don't think tension

1828
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
I would find that surprising

1829
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,791
Donda to is the first album

1830
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Did I have

1831
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:02,399
Absolutely categorically refused to listen part of the press tour for that album

1832
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,471
Infowars exactly. That was so bad

1833
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,359
That I refuse to listen to down to two.

1834
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
I have written

1835
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,455
Several hundreds of thousands of words about how much I like

1836
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
Kanye's music

1837
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,063
Yeah I think Russell Brand

1838
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,391
Jimmy Dore in Belmar in that order of descending

1839
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
Likelihood

1840
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
Are the people that I would put in the in the possible

1841
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:32,607
Honestly if history of Prelude this thing's going to end up having some weird podcast I've never heard of

1842
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:35,935
Write some somebody with guitar

1843
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,471
Audience that

1844
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
Is so

1845
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,615
Niche that I've never I would be surprised if he did Tim Dillon podcast

1846
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,175
Is he in LA or

1847
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:50,015
I think you move to Texas City move to Texas

1848
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:56,415
I don't know but yeah I think that would be a

1849
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,767
Right right I mean even on Rogan with Dale and Dylan's got to have you on his show

1850
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
Yeah and he doesn't care

1851
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
Now I don't know

1852
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
I don't know.

1853
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,495
I can't really think of many other possibilities my big money

1854
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,712
Nutella green is on on this March 8th episode

1855
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
For some reason

1856
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,296
Some of them more interesting than others

1857
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
This one is

1858
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,880
Only if more interesting

1859
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
By default cuz the rest of it's not very

1860
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
When you were in studio

1861
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
Done it today

1862
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
Breaking news right now

1863
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,496
About this

1864
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,616
Well my bill is the Congressional voting accountability

1865
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,944
Since I've been a member of Congress

1866
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,272
It's been a lot of time in the house for calling for recorded boats

1867
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,576
Do The Voice vote conundrum

1868
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
Oh my God

1869
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,368
Y'all

1870
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,768
This is absolutely going nowhere and that Marjorie will be able to make a huge deal out of how the evil government doesn't want accountability

1871
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,048
Because they wouldn't accept her bill

1872
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,400
Essentially this bill is a propaganda trap and she knows exactly what she

1873
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
He's doing

1874
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
This bill is

1875
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,520
Categorically designed to fail because of what it entails

1876
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,176
The bill would require the prohibition of not only taking voice votes in the house but also would make it so Representatives

1877
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
This could only vote yay or nay

1878
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Prohibiting them from voting present

1879
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,160
It's honestly hard to tell if Marjorie really doesn't understand the basics of how Congress work sorry

1880
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,232
If this is really just a childish Outburst of someone who does

1881
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Get to do whatever she wants

1882
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:42,912
Under the current rules anyone can call for a roll call vote if they disagree with The Voice vote

1883
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,728
Take him to a roll call vote

1884
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,752
1/5

1885
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,800
How the Quorum needs to agree to it

1886
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:55,456
Marjorie likely can't drum up 1/5 of the houses support her desire to slow down every piece of legislation to a

1887
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:59,552
But she still wants to get her way and this bill is an attempt to do that

1888
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
Yayoi

1889
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,856
You're just not going to get

1890
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
90 other people

1891
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,000
I mean you can probably get 70ish people

1892
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
In the house already

1893
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
What ended the house

1894
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,888
But also the rules

1895
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,728
Vaquera mistaken need

1896
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,264
100 members

1897
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,664
Is to be there type of coral

1898
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,712
238

1899
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:31,296
If the Full House is representative

1900
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
But still like whatever it is she doesn't have numbers

1901
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:38,464
Like I said there's no downside to this move that she's making

1902
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,864
This bill is going to fail and when it does it'll be a prime opportunity to hijack everyone's attention with claims at the houses

1903
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
Covering up their vote

1904
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,960
Which will feed into marjorie's attention economy and revenues

1905
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,288
Is just using the government as a tool to graft

1906
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,312
Bandits

1907
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
Kind of boring

1908
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
I mean

1909
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,200
It's literally she must have introduced that and everybody in the house went

1910
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
This

1911
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:05,600
Why don't you try to get Rittenhouse another medal

1912
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,648
Please

1913
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,672
Grow up

1914
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,816
So glad we talked a little bit more about what her bill would do is very dumb

1915
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
And the reason why this bill is so important

1916
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Is it wood

1917
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,496
Asking bills by Voice vote

1918
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,800
Problem

1919
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,640
Sitting on the house floor and they simply say yes and no

1920
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,456
Members of Congress

1921
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,016
This bill would force

1922
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,832
Every single member of Congress actually

1923
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,880
And not vote by proxy

1924
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,720
Show up to work and vote in person and on record

1925
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,536
The American people can see our jobs

1926
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Performance

1927
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,352
Absolutely wouldn't do any of those things

1928
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,632
There's no way she could

1929
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:52,448
Wouldn't help did this even though the way the bills written

1930
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:57,056
Waste ever because of the way the coram's are formed it would not require everyone to cut

1931
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,080
It's just

1932
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Complete

1933
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Complete waste

1934
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:06,016
Another thing I was thinking about those listen to this is how much of a boner Alex's with the idea that American government grew out of the u.s.

1935
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,856
Western British tradition all the time

1936
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,136
Our tradition

1937
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:15,744
Voice votes in the House of Commons

1938
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:20,096
And this carries over to governments in places like Canada and Australia is well

1939
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,632
A big part of our system

1940
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:28,288
I'll let you be staunchly opposed what Marjorie suggesting because it's a radical departure from the traditional upon which the founding

1941
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,312
Fathers built this

1942
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,944
Here's some fun for you in 1801 Thomas Jefferson rotateq

1943
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:41,344
Call D Manual of parliamentary practice which Marjorie is explicitly calling to upend

1944
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,880
From Jefferson's manual

1945
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:50,048
When the debate is on did the speaker holding the bill in his hand put to the question for its passage by saying gentlemen to all of you who are

1946
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,608
Of the opinion that this bill Shall Pass AI

1947
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,400
The answer of Isaac

1948
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
All of those

1949
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,960
The contrary opinion say no

1950
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:03,360
The affirmative and negative of the question having been both put in answered the speaker declares whether they yeas arnaiz have it by

1951
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
By the sound

1952
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
If he

1953
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,736
Himself satisfied and it stands as the Judgment of the

1954
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
House

1955
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,600
But if he be not himself satisfied which voice is the greater

1956
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,880
Or is before

1957
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,976
Any other member comes in the house or before any new motion made

1958
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,304
Any member shall arise and declare himself dissatisfied with the

1959
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
The speaker's this is

1960
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:28,448
Understanding of the founding fathers he pretends he studied and idolizes

1961
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
He would probably

1962
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,800
We kick Marjorie Taylor Greene out of the studio for daring to propose a bill

1963
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,128
It spits in the face of Thomas Jefferson's rules for how the house

1964
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Conduct business

1965
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,040
It doesn't mean anything

1966
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:46,112
I mean it is one of those fun things where it's like

1967
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:46,880
Lesson

1968
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Those assholes

1969
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Wrote that s***

1970
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,000
300 years ago everybody knows the

1971
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
This is

1972
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,584
Not tenable for the modern world even these dubbed

1973
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
Cuz they don't

1974
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,728
Right but as long as you're citing Jefferson all the goddamn time I guess what

1975
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:02,752
He wrote that to

1976
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,360
Douchebag yeah you're you're actively promoting

1977
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,896
Endorsing somebody

1978
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,480
Who wants to undo the Jeffersonian model

1979
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,040
Of how the voice votes are taken

1980
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
In the in the house

1981
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,880
It's a disgrace

1982
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,208
To the tradition of America I will say

1983
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
I will be off

1984
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,816
That one that one is hard to put on a meme

1985
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
So

1986
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,888
I mean as far as Thomas Jefferson quotes

1987
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,936
That one doesn't go down in history quiet

1988
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:36,032
As well I will tell you that reading that kind of language is not my strong suit

1989
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
A words

1990
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,896
In places they don't belong

1991
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
Knowing

1992
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Yes

1993
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:49,344
Not only does Voice voting go back to the literal beginning of the House of Representatives

1994
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
It also predates

1995
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,160
The American government

1996
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
This is pretty funny

1997
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,256
Most

1998
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Love the fact

1999
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,376
I mean that is

2000
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,448
Just amazing we know how long they've been pulling this trick

2001
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,800
They've been doing it for decades and decades and

2002
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
Decades of decades

2003
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,384
Paula District

2004
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,152
What are

2005
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
What are you guys doing

2006
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
What are we doing here

2007
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:22,880
What are we just put a camera showing their ignorance entirely and a lack of Interest

2008
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,952
A government operating this is borderline

2009
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,256
This reminds me more of

2010
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,584
Like those reaction videos where they give six-year-olds

2011
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,120
Like I Super Nintendo

2012
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
I know like

2013
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,680
What is this is this a phone

2014
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:41,056
Did they use this in the olden days and you're like yes I get it I'm fine with this is great

2015
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,896
This is that being like I don't understand what is this government you speak of

2016
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,944
Right or like you're in the horizon

2017
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,272
That they have a watch

2018
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:56,160
It's called a never the f*** gold high or whatever I tried

2019
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:00,000
We get back to now

2020
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
Phobic content

2021
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,584
I am so just another warning

2022
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
About to dive back

2023
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
Can't not because

2024
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
There have been these articles written

2025
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
About marjorie's,

2026
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,288
Right on Alex's show

2027
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,896
A part of her coming on is to announce this stupid bill that's going nowhere

2028
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,200
And is an affront to Thomas

2029
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
Persons Legacy naturally

2030
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,296
The other part of it is to deal with

2031
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,344
Criticism that is being Levi

2032
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Against her

2033
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:33,024
Boys build a man of straw ladies and gentlemen

2034
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,560
Creating a fake version of her comments

2035
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
5 minutes the next hour cuz I want you to be able to respond

2036
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
Annalise and

2037
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
You actually said

2038
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
Interior two weeks ago

2039
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
Put on the front so we can have a

2040
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Get out there

2041
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
The counter the fraud

2042
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,672
We were talking about men in girls showers

2043
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,232
Logical man in front of little girls

2044
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,304
And some of these man it was in the news a salted women

2045
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,840
Kevin White

2046
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,960
Imprison and raping them and you said

2047
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
Who doesn't agree

2048
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,360
Woman rapes a woman or man rapes a woman or a little girl

2049
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,688
Beat up

2050
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:26,272
RuPaul on you know their TV show

2051
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,320
You know show me some transgender person

2052
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,624
Listen true

2053
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:37,024
Although Alex was in a deep hole of mostly fake stories that he uses to push intense hatred of trans people to his

2054
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,816
Inflatable for marjorie's comment

2055
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:42,144
Marjorie wasn't responding to any of that stuff with her comment

2056
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,680
That led to Violent talk

2057
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,984
Little bit complicated

2058
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
She was responding to a

2059
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:50,080
Fake version of that story about camp

2060
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,920
Holly when she said her husband would beat somebody up but ultimately

2061
01:29:54,432 --> 01:30:00,320
The only thing that triggered that response in her was that a nonbinary person worked somewhere where kids were press

2062
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
The fact of this non-binary persons exist

2063
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:08,768
In that space is enough for her to experience as an attack or violation on a child so that's

2064
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
How they talk about

2065
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,632
And that leads to them fantasizing about committing violence

2066
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,704
But here's the towel that they know what they're doing

2067
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:23,104
In order to make their violent rhetoric seem defensible to Their audience stories like the one from

2068
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
Harbor grown men

2069
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,688
I'm sleeping or showering with 5th grade girls because

2070
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,736
Do they actually Express their real grievance

2071
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,808
It'll be way too obvious that they were full of hate

2072
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,856
They don't come to their audience

2073
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:38,720
Some say that they're mad that trans are non-binary people are allowed to have jobs and places work it might be

2074
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:44,864
Because in reality what they're saying is that they don't think the children should have any exposure to Transit on binary people

2075
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,424
Which ultimately leads to the real point of the rushing

2076
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,496
Which is the trans and non-binary people shouldn't be allowed to

2077
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Existing Pub

2078
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,592
It's really clear of this goes because think about it

2079
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
Ultimately what the

2080
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,176
The story that responding to his about is

2081
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:01,248
A couple of parents are uncomfortable their kids came back from camp

2082
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,552
Inside the Bay Medical Florida

2083
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:08,928
There was no crime committed there was no problem it was just fifth graders meeting a non-binary

2084
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,280
If this is enough to Merit the reaction that Alex and Marjorie are having

2085
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,816
Then where would they draw the line

2086
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,632
Leica Transit on diners people working retail

2087
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,168
Could they work at a library

2088
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
Could they be teachers

2089
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,288
You can easily see how much a society Alex and Marjorie wish to exclude

2090
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,336
People from under the pretend justification of

2091
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,872
Protecting children or whatever

2092
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,200
But here to things that they would never do

2093
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:35,040
It would never discuss the underlying stories as they really happen

2094
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:39,136
Because if they did it would become way to clear that they're overreacting

2095
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,440
And they would never be honest about what they want

2096
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,512
Because if they did their bigotry would be way too clear

2097
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:51,168
They only respond with grotesque bulshit in anger because that's the feeling they want their audience to experience and adopt towards

2098
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,448
Trans and non-binary people

2099
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,496
Anger and the Prejudice of

2100
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,312
Beer that they pose a threat to children by their existing

2101
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,248
Oceans notoriously for keeping you from Reading another story immediately after being so angry

2102
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:09,344
I'm so Furious I better look at it and make sure that they're accurate

2103
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,904
Curiosity

2104
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
This just happened

2105
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,744
Repeatedly

2106
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,840
Just creating fake versions of her comments in order to Justice

2107
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:27,008
You were very clear that when men pose as women and sexually assault women little girls need to be punished

2108
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,312
Yes I was

2109
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:38,016
If there is a grown man in adult biological man

2110
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:44,160
Dressing as a woman to be able to go into bathrooms dorm rooms going into

2111
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,952
Women's private places

2112
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,024
Showers and so forth and we were talking about

2113
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,144
Adult biological men

2114
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,936
Camp counselors

2115
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,984
Who identify as women

2116
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
We're staying in

2117
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:05,664
Camp Smith

2118
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,200
That's not what you said

2119
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:11,296
You can see even from this rewriting of her position how indefensible her comment

2120
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:15,136
That's where he's trying to rationalize her approval of viola

2121
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,464
Once by lying about the circumstances of the story from that count

2122
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:23,328
If there was a camp counselor regardless of gender showering with the kids and it makes a bit more sense to be

2123
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,120
But that's a fabrication

2124
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:29,216
That's just from her bigotry and the bigotry of the right-wing media that you can sue

2125
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,288
Keep pushing a fake version of a real situation in order

2126
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:34,592
Go to justify her reaction of endorsing violence

2127
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,944
If that's an essential element of this that she steadfastly refuses to accept

2128
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Because she knows

2129
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,784
That she doesn't want an accurate image

2130
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,624
That she's a dorson violence against trans and non-binary people

2131
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,928
Who work anywhere might involve children

2132
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,000
That's the position that she's actually Express

2133
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:57,120
How do I sound like a broken record but this is just disgusting Behavior to see from someone who's in elected office

2134
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,168
No she is she is

2135
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Look

2136
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
I mean

2137
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,240
It is it is

2138
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:08,640
Easy to be like oh it's it's an exaggeration or it's an overblown or or whatever but

2139
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,688
The ultimate desire here

2140
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Is

2141
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
If not

2142
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
Complete eradication

2143
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Then

2144
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,832
It is

2145
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:22,208
Going right back and it's the same thing with everything I ate today going right back to

2146
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Okay

2147
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,000
Trans kids

2148
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
Cannot be in school with this

2149
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,840
Cisgender kit trans kids

2150
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,632
Drink at the same f****** waterfall

2151
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
It's like that is not

2152
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,728
An exaggeration that is the desire

2153
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,776
That is what they want

2154
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,176
Whether or not they're willing to do all this slightly differently

2155
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
You can tell from contacts

2156
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,272
Clues that

2157
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,552
What is it like

2158
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,856
They're expressing is essentially a desire to

2159
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,136
Criminalize parents

2160
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,952
Of ptq

2161
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
Non-binary children

2162
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,560
And so it would be it would involve

2163
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352
Arresting their parents

2164
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
Re-education

2165
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,424
Probably getting them to

2166
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,008
The Camp's the things that would be just terrible

2167
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Call

2168
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,312
For Alex to

2169
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,336
Support

2170
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,920
Steam it seems like that's more in the d-line

2171
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,456
And then like Direct

2172
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
Repression

2173
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Like yeah

2174
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:22,624
Trying to create societal situations where it would be

2175
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Just

2176
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,672
Harsh

2177
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,952
Penalties for

2178
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,720
Not

2179
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,048
Livingway that someone like Marjorie

2180
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:30,816
Would approve of

2181
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,608
People live

2182
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
So again

2183
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,728
Pretender setting the record straight but they're not

2184
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,616
She wants trans people to be physically attacked

2185
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,176
What she never said that

2186
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,272
Hundreds of publication

2187
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
She's here

2188
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Congresswoman

2189
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,792
Thank you Alex I'd love to set the record straight as usual

2190
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,864
Corporate media lies they always put the lies in the headline

2191
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,448
And then maybe the truth in the last paragraph of their article

2192
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,056
The truth is that biological men are assaulting or attacking

2193
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,104
Anyone under the age of eight

2194
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,896
Children

2195
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
Yes later

2196
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,736
And there's nothing wrong with saying that

2197
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,552
Corporate media and the end the radical leftist Arc

2198
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:26,112
Sbl

2199
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,160
How the rest of America fields

2200
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:32,768
Not only do they deserve to be that they deserve being arrested they deserve to be charged

2201
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Deserved

2202
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,304
Prison

2203
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,352
This isn't setting the record straight

2204
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,120
It's lying

2205
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:41,472
Is marjorie's position was just the people who sell children should be arrested or even if

2206
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,032
She understands that a person like apparently

2207
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:50,432
Instinct would be to respond violently their child is assaulted uncontroversial and don't really

2208
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
Think writing a better comment not a word

2209
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:57,344
The problem in the issue that Marjorie and Alex will not disagree gate from their b*******

2210
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,744
He's lit she and Alex believed the trans and non-binary people existing in public is in and of itself and assault on chilled

2211
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:10,656
They won't make this position that they hold clear because they know that to do so would mean some real problems particularly from

2212
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:14,240
Marjorie said she still with the fundraising and stuff

2213
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,776
Being in the house gets racks

2214
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,824
She's not

2215
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,592
Outside of

2216
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:23,200
Being a lunatic who's in the house

2217
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
Have that then

2218
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,992
She got nothing

2219
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,808
She can maybe get a show on Infowars Mabel sinking ship

2220
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,672
When Marjorie said when she said she was responding to a story that had nothing to do with violence

2221
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,208
Or children being assaulted

2222
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,256
G imagine that that was the case

2223
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,560
Because of her underlying bigotries that equates

2224
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,120
Trans and non-binary existence 28

2225
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:41,888
Threat

2226
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:47,776
This is an essential question when it comes to assessing our comments which is why it will never come up on Infowars

2227
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:52,128
The lying and spinning masquerading as correcting the record will continue

2228
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,944
The charade can continue

2229
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,736
And it says it's pretty repulsive

2230
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Yeah

2231
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:01,344
Yeah a lot of this is really just want to boil it down to be like

2232
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
Listen

2233
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,160
Do you want to improve things

2234
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,720
Or do you do or do you want to do things that

2235
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,000
Satisfy you almost

2236
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:15,168
You know like it's very satisfying emotionally angry but if you're not going to get a straight answer

2237
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,192
I hate that the truth

2238
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,800
Satisfying myself emotionally is

2239
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
What I call making

2240
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,736
It's not what if you did make things better and it didn't satisfy you emotionally with that

2241
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,504
Abbey press

2242
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Rebel

2243
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
And the answer is no

2244
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:35,904
Again it's just

2245
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,464
Marjorie there's a justification

2246
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,232
For what you said

2247
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:44,096
Now biological men that are trying to act like their women is Camp counselors

2248
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,680
Going into showers with this graders or sleeping in their cabins

2249
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,984
With other little girls or boys

2250
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:53,568
That is completely wrong and it's okay for me to say

2251
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,360
They might

2252
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
They might need a

2253
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,224
You know there's nothing wrong with that and I'll double down

2254
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
Say it again

2255
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:06,112
About hating trans people are anyone

2256
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,392
It's not

2257
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,672
That story isn't

2258
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,488
Like that's not an element of the story

2259
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
If it were thicker, so

2260
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:19,936
Still be wildly inappropriate and Unbecoming of somebody who's an elected office but

2261
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:26,336
She's just lying in order to soften what she saying or make it more defensible and it is not it is not

2262
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,640
Commentary is not defensible

2263
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
It's

2264
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:30,944
It's a disgrace

2265
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,296
I don't know I don't know what to say really

2266
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
Outside of

2267
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,880
It's nuts

2268
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,648
That

2269
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
She's coming on in Fort Worth

2270
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,512
I mean even Trump only showed up once

2271
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,072
Priority was mostly the shallows book

2272
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:52,704
He's coming on and there is a part of me that's keenly aware that the midterm is coming up

2273
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,800
And it might just be something where's I got maybe I'll be able to get some voters out of this

2274
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
It's

2275
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
A bit more of a connection

2276
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,968
It appeared previously

2277
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,760
Fasting

2278
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
Is predictable

2279
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,576
And also troubling

2280
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,624
It's predictable in the sense that

2281
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,928
She's trying to sell these stupid

2282
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,256
Publicity stunt bills chair

2283
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:19,584
Let's get everyone excited and I'll create these narratives around

2284
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:24,192
The house is hiding everything they do behind voice votes or whatever the f***

2285
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,472
There's that

2286
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,848
Say level of

2287
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:33,408
The transfer is being

2288
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
Deployed by her

2289
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
And Alex and

2290
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,992
In conjunction with her

2291
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:40,064
Is further than some of the

2292
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
Some of the stuff it may be happy

2293
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
Canzano more regular basis

2294
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,160
And that's

2295
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:44,928
That's not good

2296
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
Yeah

2297
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,000
I mean even if the story was

2298
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,280
Exactly what she

2299
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,304
She characterized it as

2300
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,840
Even if she was

2301
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:54,656
100% getting this story itself right

2302
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
It is still not

2303
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,240
About biological men causing

2304
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,520
Harm

2305
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,080
If it support children person

2306
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:02,848
It is

2307
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,920
Committed a crime

2308
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,688
Importantly

2309
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,480
It's not about Ben

2310
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,784
It's not about men. It is about

2311
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
Trans people

2312
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:18,208
Non-binary person

2313
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,792
Anybody outside of the f****** door or whatever

2314
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,936
But what she considers plenty of violence that men

2315
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,008
To get swimming that she is 100%

2316
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,568
It's not about violence against women or children

2317
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,616
I'll see what I'm doing with Matt King

2318
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,384
Yeah it is

2319
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,688
Yeah

2320
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,760
So I mean I expect Ally

2321
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,600
Yeah.

2322
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:49,440
I don't know I have a tough time

2323
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
Putting any kind of

2324
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,256
Summation on this other than to say like

2325
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,816
I find this deeply

2326
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,352
Troubling and I think it's a good

2327
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,656
Deserves

2328
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,216
You know and I cast upon it

2329
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
And I don't

2330
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
I think it's something that should be overlooked

2331
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,312
Obviously

2332
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,616
Enough thing when I was sitting person

2333
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,896
In Congress

2334
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,432
Who's not named Ron Paul

2335
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,968
Shows up on Alex

2336
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
I think that's

2337
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
Problem

2338
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,528
And then when it's

2339
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,552
The content is like

2340
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
This

2341
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,088
It's just

2342
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:21,952
And then it's also a person who spoke at Flint this is bulshit

2343
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:23,232
I guess it's

2344
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Yeah

2345
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,816
Yeah I mean the summation is like

2346
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
Care for and protect

2347
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
Text trans people

2348
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,680
Do as much of that as you can

2349
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
And just making them

2350
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,520
On a functional level making them happy

2351
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,824
Happy trans people is a f******

2352
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,640
Terrorizing thing to the

2353
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
To the right

2354
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,432
Don't don't

2355
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,456
Use violence

2356
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,736
Help people

2357
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,064
I think obviously is

2358
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,344
The most important

2359
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
Something the people

2360
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,136
Can do

2361
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,488
Like beat like

2362
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,512
I don't know

2363
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:00,864
Vote for Jennifer Strahan primary

2364
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,936
Find some way to stop these people

2365
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,008
Retailer green is somebody who

2366
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,664
Getting outraged at her speeds Nicole

2367
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
This

2368
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
And her comment

2369
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,112
Leads to her being able to do it a Victory lap on Alex's show double down on stuff

2370
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,952
And create a larger false presentation of what she was saying

2371
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
And

2372
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,560
She's vulnerable in the GOP Primary

2373
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,352
Caribbean Pools that have shown

2374
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,424
But there is a possibility that someone could be

2375
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,704
Beat her in that primary

2376
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:37,728
And

2377
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,544
I feel like

2378
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:46,688
It's entirely possible she has no place to be in government absolutely not

2379
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,456
Credibly

2380
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,736
Horrible positions

2381
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,064
Then also for her clear lack of understanding of

2382
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,856
Literally anything about Civic

2383
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,136
And corrupt

2384
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:55,904
Corrupt

2385
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
Wow that's kind of

2386
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,232
That's par for the course right

2387
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,072
With another episode

2388
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
Maybe you talk

2389
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:04,864
More about

2390
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:11,264
Maybe we'll cover Alex's appearance on Real Time with Bill

2391
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,616
We also are on

2392
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,432
We are now just fighting that go to bed Jordan

2393
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:23,552
Dzx Gorgan dr. marbles

2394
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
And now here comes

2395
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
The sex robot

2396
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,976
Alex
