00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,240
I've gotten back to make

Quite quite a response

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
Cranked out and sent out to people

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,784

Text Mike recreational time

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
While I'm sitting around making button

21
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,744
Sure I've been watching a bit of Survivor

22
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,096
Okay when I ran to

23
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,936
I'm starting at the beginning

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
It's better getting yes but I'm not putting a time frame on it

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Episodes of The Tick

26
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
I realized well I've got this Amazon Prime account now I've never had access to whatever is on

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,184
And so I was like I loved season 2 of Survivor

28
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
When I was a kid

29
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,584
Season 1 to season 2 stuck out in my head as like being really great

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
I watched a couple other seasons

31
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
I missed a lot

32
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
And I missed

33
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
The time

34
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,520
And I really am curious where did it fall apart

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Lie cuz I know who they've got

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
Everything got too complicated everything

37
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
The total mass

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Yeah

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
It was

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Good I think

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
Oh and so I started watching

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
From the beginning

43
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
And I have not gotten

44
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,672
To where it's terrible

45
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
I'm in season 2

46
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
And

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
I want to talk about it

48
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Non-Stop

49
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
I have a million

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Yeah oh wow okay why I'd started a little bit before

51
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Like I have

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
I have so many thoughts

53
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
About all of this

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
First of all

55
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Season 1 is amazing

56
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
Okay it's it's a very

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Well done

58
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,760
There's an earnestness to it that like

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,648
There's a recognition that what they're doing is a little bit goofy chordae mean it

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Sincere right right very nice

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Season Two's A little bit

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
The little bit of a departure

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,680
There's a there's a little bit less of that to genuine

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,008
That Curiosity shoes

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,360
Well I think that I think that

66
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,944
If you cut like a first season really wasn't that

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,320
Like everyone being like who am I going to

68
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
And season 2 it's just like

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
Is it already is jumping into that

70
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
I'm going to throw this out

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
Coucher when people get to aware of

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
The metagame

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
I think that there's a lot of conversation

74
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
Wrong wherever we know how to plan for this is the right move

75
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,040
What happened in season 3 or whatever you do

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Yeah

77
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,440
I think that is beginning to happen already in season 2 not overwhelming but it's

78
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
Like it's very different than the kind of conversations they're having in season 1

79
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,351
Yeah I realize wow

80
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,935
And the other thing to was

81
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
I don't watch any of these that's like

82
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
I mean what would it been like

83
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
This is pre 9/11 stuff

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
Yeah straight up I think that we're on like he's in 2000

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,503
Yeah we're on the season 13 hours

86
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,903
I was like 16 or 17

87
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
Remember watching it in like I had

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Various feelings about various cast members

89
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,607
Re-watching it one of the things that really stuck out to me with those two things

90
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
First

91
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Elizabeth

92
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,495
I really like Elisabeth filarski she was great

93
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
And I realized re-watching it that I liked her because she reminded me of the girls that I had a crush on

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
In church okay alright to really sweet kind of word

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,927
Track

96
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
And the other thing I did I didn't realize

97
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
Watching back is that there was this guy Michael

98
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Who fell into the fire

99
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,983
And ended up getting evacuated got airlifted I watched it when I was younger he seems like such a leader

100
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
You know received like a somebody who's like

101
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Is outdoorsy

102
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Watching it now

103
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
Increase

104
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
Total weirdo so weird sucks

105
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
I had a very negative response

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
To him watching it

107
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
I am too I was

108
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
Just looking out for these people now

109
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Turns out he got arrested

110
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Good for running a Ponzi scheme

111
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,911
And in the process of the investigation they found c********* on his computer

112
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
That's what I've always dreamt of Survivor being more like those early years of Sasuke the the Ninja

113
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Warrior

114
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
Just because like they would make a huge deal of like this is our 25th

115
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Season

116
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,087
And there's only been one person who made it to the top of Mount Midoriyama

117
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,927
And it's like I've always wanted Survivor to be that where it's like we're on season 40

118
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
Two people that survive winter

119
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Yeah yeah I think

120
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,495
I think in order to do that you have to really rich people's help

121
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Steal the other solution is like

122
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,687
People died this year

123
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
Taken aback by it was like in the first season berries

124
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Is not a lot of problem with food

125
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
Totally fine on rice

126
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Richard is out there fishing you catching all kinds of fish

127
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
They have rat traps that they've created the eating rats

128
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
Yeah it is not a problem

129
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Events season 2

130
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
It's a bit of a problem

131
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,007
But it's only a problem because they miss ration the rice

132
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
I feel like

133
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
That takes away from this

134
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Being about surviving

135
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
That's it

136
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,807
So funny just because I remember reading this huge like

137
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
Oral history of kid nation or whatever that MTV reality show was where they put

138
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,559
Town of kids and they're all like 30 kids they're all like 12 years old

139
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
And the oral history behind it was they built a functioning Society

140
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Producers will like we can't

141
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
We were going for Lord of the Flies but in real life

142
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Looking everything up for these kids osher

143
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,015
We got garbage pickup why are you guys throwing garbage around like awesome

144
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:56,415
It's so funny to me that they can build like a we're rationing appropriate

145
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
Adults do it

146
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,767
A reality show there like 1 all the food

147
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,839
Yeah there was also like real fingerprints

148
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Weird manipulation

149
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
But I didn't recognize

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Watching it initially

151
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Like there's like

152
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,359
1 levels of awareness of what's going on at the other camp that like people shouldn't have

153
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Oh yeah

154
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
Producers are talk

155
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
It was a little bit like

156
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
All right I see through a little bit of this

157
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,159
More but anyway it's fun and I'm excited to see where it really falls apart

158
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
Buy like season 7 or something it's going to be a disaster

159
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
My aunt before she died watch

160
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Every season of Survivor

161
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Loved it so much she watched

162
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
Survivor and big brother knows where the two for her

163
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
And I just remember watching like

164
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
I think it was like season 23 with her

165
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
And just going like

166
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
How

167
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Do you not want these people

168
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
Shot into the surface of the Sun and she's like that's why I watch

169
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
That's why you watch that you watch

170
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Pool for summer

171
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:06,559
We talked about this too much already but blast point I want to make the experience that I had

172
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,863
Watching season 1 is that I like

173
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Both of the tribes

174
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Aiden watching season 2

175
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,287
Cuz I don't like either of these

176
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Which is weird

177
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
It's not definitely not how I experienced it as a u

178
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,759
Anyway I will talk more about this as it goes along I'm sure

179
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
The Creator's new album

180
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Friday

181
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Fantastic

182
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Absolutely fantastic

183
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
Jessica's last album scumfuckflowerboy

184
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Was

185
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,471
More of an R&B album almost like a Frank Ocean album

186
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
And this one he gets right back to

187
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,591
Just doing straight-up hip-hop and rapping and he's so good

188
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
It's amazing

189
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,991
Especially his career Arc can you imagine being like four

190
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,367
14 years old and and then becoming what he becomes like a weird

191
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Is wild

192
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Look forward to an oral history of that one thing

193
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255

194
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,911
I'm sorry to not spend 10 minutes on your brights

195
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
Thoughts about

196
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
I could have complexed thoughts but they might be very boring they could be

197
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
It will not be boring Jordan is all right

198

Oh s*** we're doing present-day episode I thought we were going we're doing

200
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Present-day episode because I wanted to give Alex

201
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
The chance to have a more developed

202
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
Conspiracy theory about John McAfee staff

203
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Call report is emergency brake

204
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495

00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543

00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735

Can't even start a podcast without getting a million dollars

217

Is someone life is giving someone death

223
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
You can say that

224
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Life is good

225
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479

00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Could see it being automata Monday episode like you just says that exact same thing every new episode

228
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
2021 all right here's an out-of-context

229
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
He hasn't said it as much but there was a little stretch

230
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
Like a week or two ago where he was

231
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Articulating that talked quite a bit

232
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
Cade

00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615

Cade happy golden birthday

239
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,951
My golden birthday I was 24

240
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
And I was a mistake

241
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,375
Hopefully KD let me where I am today but

242
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Anyway hope you have a good one

243
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
My golden birthday was 8 and it started me doing stand-up

244
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Aaj Ka Rick

245
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,479

249
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Happy birthday is a sandwich sandwich

00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,791
Irwin Kansas Moses this is

251
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
This is important

252
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583

And a wedding

254
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Coming out

255
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
There's a very important request

256
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
This is not guaranteed

257
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
But it I checked in on it

258
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
And Selene does give her blessing

259
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
Nicer yet there was a chance that Selena be like

260
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
Hallmark says is a good wedding gift

261
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271

And we like to congratulate Metal Alchemist I think that's a Fullmetal Alchemist

266
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
But I wanted to wish this

267
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Baby

268
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
A welcome into the world and the congratulation

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
To ran into although unfortunately to give life is 2 kg

270
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Let's get in today's episode Jordan

271
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
Today we have

272
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
Contacts

273
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
I don't have to imagine really don't that's kind of regular

274
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Pretty Dura lyrics

275
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,663
Thankfully like sometimes you jump you thinking like

276
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
Is it going to talk about

277
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
The thing that I'm interested in sure

278
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Namely

279
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
McAfee

280
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
And sometimes he doesn't

281
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
In this case thankfully he.

282
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,975
Well we've got the Red emergency

283
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Radar scan

284
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Background up

285
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
I need one thing

286
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Assassinated

287
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
10 days ago our style that we talked about

288
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
Very famous

289
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
Emmy award-winning

290
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
The Grammy Award

291
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
TV news

292
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
That expose the tarmac meaning

293
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,343
With Bill Clinton and then attorney general Loretta Lynch

294
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
We shouldn't even tried to kill him

295
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
Commit suicide

296
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
And then he was found shot

297
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
In the head inside of Home Alone

298
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
Married man with two children

299
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
John

300
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
McAfee you I do very well

301
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
20 *

302
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
We haven't talked in the last few years because he was in a Madrid jail

303
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:54,879
Awaiting extradition

304
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
They will suicide myself they will kill me

305
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
Episode we discussed the immediate coverage of McAfee is death

306
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,167
Story in the context of Alex's coverage of the death of Chris

307
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
A sign

308
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,567
Because I want to lay the groundwork for a narrative Arc about political assassinations when he talked about sign

309
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,895
He was prepared to tell this exact story no matter who ended up dying

310
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
And regardless of how suspicious the circumstances of their death

311
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Really work

312
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,135
Alex looked out in a high-profile person who is sort of associated with died not too long after signs coverage

313
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
We would be seeing the outcome that we're seeing now

314
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,255
If no high-profile dance fit the bill Alex

315
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
Could easily

316
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,631
You know just get away with pretending he never made a big deal out of signs no pretending

317
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
But it was a professional

318
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
You can really tell how dishonest that works

319
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
The coverage is because of the intentional MS

320
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Reporting he's doing

321
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Surrounding these two cases

322
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
For instance Christopher sign as far as I can tell never said that he wouldn't kill himself then

323
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
The comment that he was getting threats

324
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
That came from a fox interview from

325
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
From February 2020

326
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
He was specifically talking about the rights that it come quote

327
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Shortly after breaking the story

328
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Which is to say back

329
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
In 2016

330
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,607
You never specified who the threats were coming from and it could have easily been from mentally Disturbed

331
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
Pro Clinton or anti-trump individuals

332
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Completely disconnected from

333
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
The two politicians

334
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
There's no reason to jump to the conclusion that it was

335
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
F****** Hillary making the threat

336
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,223
Alex's disorder distorted this to fit his narratives because it Infowars world

337
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,087
Anytime anyone dies by suspected suicide we wants to paint is the victim of a Murder

338
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
The same script as followed

339
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,207
I'll testify to the details of this case would neatly fits the ark

340
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
What type of he's already established with past case

341
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,911
Also sign had three children and many of the details of his life that Alex is getting wrong or just things that Alex is assuming

342
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Ryan making out

343
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
The same Dynamic existing coverage of McAfee

344
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Some of the details that are

345
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Completely wrong included

346
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
McAfee hasn't been in jail for years

347
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
And it wasn't in jail in Madrid

348
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,223
The daily was in was in Barcelona

349
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,831
More importantly though is Alex's lying but the timeline of McAfee

350
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,975
The tweet that Alex's referencing where McAfee said he was quoted getting subtle messages from us officials

351
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Posted on November 30th 2019

352
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
He said he wasn't going to kill himself was from

353
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
8 months ago

354
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:19,263
Alex needs to take these tweets and make them a lot more current than they are because the in reality there

355
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
Completely rational explanation

356
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
Nothing to do

357
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
With the notion that McAfee was the target of a globalist hits

358
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
By combining these sentiments that McAfee is Sheridan

359
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
In the course of the last few years

360
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
And pretending said them just

361
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Before he died

362
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
I was just trying to create a persuasive

363
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Eviction cell is audience

364
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
And that picture is exactly how Alex's started the show

365
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,095
The point in the messages that the globalist are entering the part of their endgame where they're going

366
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
In the stage high-level political assassinations of their paper autonomy

367
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
This mentality is so dangerous for Alex to be playing around with

368
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,871
Since it's one of the things in the past he said is a sign that the cold Civil War is going hot

369
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
And it'll be very easy for his listeners to take this as a sign

370
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
That is killing time

371
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:05,343
You've already got your list I've told you to get your list out there now it's time to enact

372
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Spell playing

373
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
Ethically speaking this is yelling fire in a crowded building

374
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,583
No matter what the outcome is and whether or not anyone gets hurt this is just Reckless endangering activity

375
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
It's fine to yell fire when there is a fire

376
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Cuz there's a fire people

377
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
You know you can help them avoid the fire right

378
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,407
In order for Alex to metaphorically create the appearance of a fire here he has to lie about multiple details of these two men's death

379
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,295
This isn't someone responsibly covering the fact of a situation it's someone lying about reality to suit his purposes

380
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Which is making money

381
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
Not caring at all who gets hurt

382
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
He's a real

383
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,743
Piece of s*** like I really like whenever I used to work

384
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,071
Customer service you can have those macro responses that you

385
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,887
He's pretty written responses it's almost

386
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
When McAfee died he was almost like

387
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
Boom Madlibs I'm already ready

388
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
I've been doing this for 20 years

389
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Is pre-written

390
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
You know it's like fucoffee bottles that are like

391
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,319
I can't afford that well Lord if I told you

392
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Is it safe

393
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
It's sort of a branching

394
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
Video already knew was going to go down

395
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
So what are the interesting things about McAfee is death that isn't actually a

396
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Nothing but some people on the internet

397
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,471
Having fun with it is the idea that

398
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
Alex's found it

399
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
Basically as you already know

400
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Found dead yesterday

401
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Pretty amazing and he said he got a dead man switch

402
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Sound

403
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
The Deadman switch buried in

404
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Talking about that

405
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,559
Coming up here on the transmission today this is all made up

406
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
It doesn't look like McAfee actually had a dead man switch setup because the way he's described his failed to become a real

407
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Madea doll

408
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
He told an interviewer that he had a choice

409
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Daily check-in switch

410
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,151
So if you ever missed any of those check-ins the dirt would all be sent to the media

411
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,759
That's not the same thing as him burying something somewhere in a bizarre and complicated

412
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,855
Cryptomages John McAfee is so

413
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Aware of time that he's never

414
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,512
John McAfee has never missed a date

415
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,840
I've never been drug it out

416
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Hungover

417
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:31,776
What's actually going on here is that after back if he's dead someone posted an image on his Instagram with you was just a big

418
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,544
Q right

419
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
After this happened qanon folks started

420
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Speculating that the image

421
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Continue the key to a cryptocurrency address

422
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Show a map where all the goodies were

423
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
This is made up out of thin air and completely not true

424
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,880
There's meditate on the picture but from everything I've seen about the situation.

425
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
It's not a crypto key

426
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,048
McKay's Alex is just taking bulshit he or his staff read on a conspiracy blog or Messi

427
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Message board

428
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Pretending that he got it from

429
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Some kind of

430
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,424
Navigate of process or imaginary high-level source

431
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752
But he's trying to pass off a sanitized version of it to his audience

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
This is essentially Alex's role at this point

433
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,432
Find dumb s*** on the internet and tries to laundry to the point where it can pass is a story he could

434
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Pretend to report

435
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Inevitably this dead man switch will fail

436
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,576
Materialize and Alex would probably say that the global is somehow

437
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Recoup dead or something

438
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
Then there's going to be this great

439
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Magoffin out there

440
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
We could totally prove all of Ark

441
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,536
Conspiracies are truth only Mac if he's dead man switch

442
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,608
Hannah been received by the globalist or whatever

443
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,448
See this is a problem with the internet conspiracy theories they don't know how to have

444
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
Have fun with it here's what you do

445
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
You don't have any evidence that this isn't

446
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
The case say that they found trace evidence

447
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
Of John McAfee dick in his own stomach

448
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:49,600
Then why everybody's like a human leg out of a shark's stomach and everybody's like

449
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
I guess he actually followed through with it forward

450
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
The man who had one big left

451
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Do on this

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
That was either though dick it's been done

453
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
News story of the day there's also talk

454
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Fauci

455
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
Doing covid

456
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
Grouchy one month before the cupboard

457
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
Outbreak

458
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Covid

459
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
Covid-19 vaccine program

460
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Windows exact sequence

461
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Understand

462
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Premeditation

463
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,280
Total complete open-and-shut case

464
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Everyone involved

465
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
Is lucky or they end up in a supermax

466
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Frozen

467
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
Arrest of their lives

468
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
I decided to play a little game with his drop okay I was going to treat this story as if I was just a listener of Alex's show

469
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,920
Like what would I know about this story from the information that he's present

470
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
At this point

471
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
I guess that a month before the pandemic started

472
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Fauci Direct

473
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
Get someone to begin working on a vaccine that's mysteriously a perfect

474
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Covid-19

475
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
That's

476
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Mysterious

477
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,816
And this is being presented as definitive open-and-shut proof that there was premeditation with a development and release the virus

478
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
I've not heard this

479
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
So I'm going to

480
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,728
Eagerly await Alex telling me more about it

481
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,264
He doesn't

482
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,664
That's surprising yet seems like a big story ruined my entire game but not

483
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
I'm going to act like a Alex's listener experience

484
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
B******* and you have no idea why or where

485
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
But I have no idea

486
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
The back to McAfee

487
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
McAfee

488
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
McAfee

489
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,448
Mine really smart individual true American rebel

490
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
Why does gel cell in Barcelona Spain

491
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
It's 75 years of age infidel

492
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,040
World

493
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
U.s. government is

494
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Suicide

495
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Commit suicide

496
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
And I believe him

497
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,584
Wishing a lot of suicide lately of people that challenged the clintons and others

498
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,864
A lot

499
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Not that it's a Clinton

500
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
A lot

501
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Call Dad

502
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Call it

503
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,592
My immediate response when my friend texted me about this was

504
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,176
Somehow Hillary I got bingo

505
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Of course it was

506
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
I mean the other

507
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
One thing that I would expect

508
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
From John Mackey

509
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,232
The day before he killed himself to claim that he would never kill himself like

510
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
But even so

511
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
All of the stuff that Alex is talking about his old tweets but he's pretending happened a week before

512
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
No he is not

513
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,408
Neither is Alex does not matter if he is his best friend or something

514
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,552
This is like when somebody in your high school dies in the most popular kid is suddenly like

515
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
I was their best

516
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
Friend please everybody feel bad for me

517
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
God you're evil

518
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,560
So Alex plays a little clip hear of McAfee talking about the Deep state

519
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
I have some thoughts

520
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Cheering from the grave

521
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
Talking about the political process on this planet

522
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
The Deep state

523
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Is a

524
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Conspiracy

525
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,296
It's defined as the people within the US government military who are in C

526
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Secret

527
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
Please people

528
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
The Deep state

529
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Is those peep

530
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Within

531
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
The US

532
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
That are

533
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Career employees

534
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
Cannot be fired by

535
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
We

536
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Elect

537
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
By the Congress

538
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
The president

539
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:55,104
There are the FCC

540
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
The CIA

541
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
Securities and Exchange Commission

542
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
All of them can be fined RS

543
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Control

544
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Can they enact

545
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
Laws

546
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
No kiss

547
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
The cold regulations

548
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,024
I understand that Mike if he's a real hard-nosed libertarian in the

549
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,144
Nothing more than government regulation idiotic

550
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Apparently the

551
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Deep state of these government employees who can't be touched

552
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
No matter who you like

553
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,872
These people include according to McAfee the CIA the SEC the FCC and the IRS

554
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
And every single person who is headed those agencies

555
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:36,576
Is it for the past 10 years has been fighting there's a little bit of nuance to it

556
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,464
The CIA is headed by director who is nominated by the president who we elect confirm

557
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Who are elected

558
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:49,376
CIA director reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence who is nominated by the president who was elected

559
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Nothing confirmed by the Senate

560
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,192
Who is our like it

561
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
If the president who was elected

562
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,336
It so chooses they can replace even the CIA director or the Director of National Intelligence

563
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,664
I guess it would probably be improper for the president

564
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,760
To fire an individual CIA employee but through the chain of command if there was a

565
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Specific legitimate Direction

566
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
The president wanted to take the organization they could do that by picking

567
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
The new director

568
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
So assholes but just

569
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,768
Data entry in El Dorado is the president fire gif

570
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
No reason he just wanted to see if he could Obama thinks you're up to

571
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,472
The SEC the security

572
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,616
Exchange Commission is run by a Board of Commissioners are appointed by the president who was elected and confirmed by the Senate who are elected

573
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
They're put in for five-year term

574
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,272
When he was running for office John McCain threatened to fire the SEC chair which sparked

575
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,832
The conversation about whether or not he actually could

576
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
It seems a bit unclear whether president could fire them without Congressional approval but

577
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,048
It would be a really big deal to try to remove one of these people

578
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
The SEC is supposed to remain very independent seeing as their tasks

579
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
With dealing with Market manipulation

580
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
To be best not to allow people like a president to be in the position where they could fire them without a really good reason

581
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,664
It's almost like for retaliation towards let's say one of their super rich

582
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,712
Which friends that might be something that you would

583
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
The SEC to be in Independence

584
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
Yeah it's something that you'd really need to

585
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Try to create

586
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,792
Safeguards against the appearance of impropriety willy-nilly firing an SEC

587
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Dinner would be

588
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
Imagine if you were is Senator with

589
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,472
Early information that a pandemic was coming

590
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,360
And you sold all of this stock before everything happened whenever we still at a higher value

591
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,944
That's something that the SEC would investigate and take care of

592
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
If they were an independent organization as we all know they are

593
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:45,088
ICC is run by a board that is appointed by the

594
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
President who was elected

595
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Confirmed by the Senate

596
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Or Alexa

597
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,744
This is also an agency that's meant to be independent so it's widely understood

598
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,328
The president could not just randomly fire an SEC commissioner

599
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,448
Interesting article from 2014 and Politico brought up a way that a president could still

600
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,496
Work to shape FCC policy

601
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Well it's accepted that Obamacare

602
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,616
Could not fire the SEC chair he disagreed on policy

603
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
Zephyr teachout made an argument that he

604
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
He could still remove the chair from that position

605
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
And replace them with one of the other commits

606
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
This would keep the same board intact

607
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
But still shake up the power Dino

608
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:23,488
So while there's good reason that the President should not have the sole authority to mold and penitent

609
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
Agencies are there will there still things that

610
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
Can be done to affect change

611
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:32,960
The irs's Run by a commissioner who's also appointed by the president was elected in

612
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
Confirmed by the Senate elected

613
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Arsene

614
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Some arguments that suggest their president

615
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Actually fire the IRS commissioner

616
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
In a lot of conservatives are really pissed off

617
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:47,040
The truck didn't do just that during his term went John tashkin was in that position

618
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,904
Similarly there now calls for Biden to fire Charles Reddick who's the most recent person

619
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Fill the role

620
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
Being appointed by Trump into

621
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
2018

622
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,768
Neither commissioner was or has been

623
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:01,120
Been fired in the reason again is probably the doing something like that requires a really strong just

624
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,192
Occasion or else it'll just look like severe corruption

625
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
The idea that the government is secretly run by these on elect

626
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
The people is a popular refrain among folks like McAfee but it fails to take into account that each of them serves at the pleasure of people who are alike

627
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
And the choices that are made

628
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
In elections can have

629
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
Drastic

630
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
Implication

631
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
On any one of these are

632
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Renovations what are the big

633
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,392
Failings of our government is that

634
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,304
Trump appointed an incredibly corrupt person to run the IRS and then it would look like corruption if you

635
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
Just fired up

636
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
It's like Jesus there's just no ass

637
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
It's not

638
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,800
How you would want it to be it's unclear what level of Elections and how

639
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't know

640
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
IRS

641
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:50,528
The Midland management or whatever with that need to be elected

642
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Satisfy Maccabees complaint

643
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
The reason that it's confusing because it's not a real

644
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,208
Compliant you just doesn't like regulation and government doesn't want to pay too

645
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,792
A fine position to has but the framing of this argument

646
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Modesto Toledo

647
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,960
Dishonest if you're if you're being like all their own elected deep State people we should reform it but you're

648
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:15,360
Your actual plan is like a we should just burn down the IRS forever and the building is gone and the government's gone

649
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
Just get rid of all of it

650
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
Don't frame it like you want it

651
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,344
And the point that you're making about like eruption still existing within even organizations that are

652
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Intended to be

653
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Independent

654
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
What is is

655
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
Is very fair

656
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
The different it's a different

657
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Complain

658
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:36,352
Then the complaint that McAfee is bringing you and I are not in agreement

659
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Mia

660
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
So

661
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,216
You know what else you're not in agreement about

662
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
Just about everything

663
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
Your resume

664
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,312
I'll give you the inside scoop

665
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
On

666
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,408
Good idea exactly was I was doing

667
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
He did work for

668
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
Guava different spook agencies

669
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
Including the CIA

670
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
Masa

671
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,232
Including Shadow government

672
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,584
While

673
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,400
He was recruited into it as young man

674
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Intelligence level

675
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
And good luck sweetheart all

676
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
What

677
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
The rest is history they killed him

678
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Debtor

679
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Man

680
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,944
So what's the what's the agency you think he was in those above the

681
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,832
The CIA aliens Bradley

682
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
Treaty with the aliens in which case I guess they're kind of

683
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,440
Coco equal branch of universal government

684
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
I'm excited for Alex on on a

685
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,512
Very

686
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
I mean it's sort of facetiously but

687
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,144
McAfee is somebody who Alex can makeup

688
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
So many stories about

689
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Yeah totally he can have a field day

690
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
I would buy would buy most anything right

691
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
Couldn't have

692
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,480
It's almost the ideal person for Alex to have

693
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
Die cuz now you can take total control over the narrative my best friend

694
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:08,768
Cooper let's do it all man you imagine how many things Alex can make up that McAfee told him

695
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
Conversation

696
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:16,960
I couldn't tell you before because he's alive and now I got to Spill the Beans

697
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:23,872
Government systems

698
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,456
I drop is going to be Alex's imagination

699
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
It back if he does

700
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,624
Three times a day Alex will claimed he's killed everyone

701
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
So Alex is a

702
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Is is OverWatch

703
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,280
Teeth poleaxed you might sell

704
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,328
Let me just try to process this

705
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,448
Reason I'm going to be a I am here today

706
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Because I am Pole

707
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,104
Trying to really cut to the heart of the matter so let me just

708
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
Put this out now

709
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,480
There comes a moment when the Tyranny really lodges is full of tact

710
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
It all the window dressing Falls away

711
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,624
Do you learn more in a daily alarm the previous year

712
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
More in that Zeitgeist that quickening

713
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
That acceleration

714
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
That

715
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Apocalypse

716
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Apocalypse

717
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
Everybody is dying

718
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,240
New ideas coming forward

719
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
Death Rows of

720
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,336
The Old World Order

721
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,152
It calls itself the New World Order

722
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,712
Wanted to control the future of humanity

723
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
Everything I say is an inverse

724
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
They say they're the new age they are the Dark Age

725
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,368
So do you want a new world order

726
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
I think that's what he's saying we don't want the old world order to be the new world order we want a new world order to be the new world

727
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,328
I just grow weary of listening to this

728
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,632
Over so many different time periods

729
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
I and Alex constantly saying

730
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
You learn more in a day than you did in the year it's so many different times

731
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
It always

732
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
Seems to be like

733
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Everything is

734
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Isn't it

735
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
Intensifying now

736
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,200
Alex is the voice of the

737
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
The person who's like

738
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
This is the most important time in history ever

739
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,880
Everett healing that every generation has

740
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Yep

741
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Nobody nobody thinks the world is going to exist after the

742
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
There's a certain solipsism to every generation

743
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
That is kind of

744
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,192
Just so standard on Alex's broadcast-style it's

745
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
It's annoying

746
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Yep

747
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
I'm so about a year-and-a-half ago it was

748
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
Declared over for Humanity

749
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
There would only be Lone Survivor

750
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
According to Mike Adams the health Ranger

751
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Can't argue with the truth

752
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Apparently vaccines are killing everybody now I don't know anybody who's got the vaccine and it's not dead

753
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,416
Alex makes a

754
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Bold

755
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,952
Prediction

756
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,048
About what the world will look like in a year is it over

757
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,584
It feels like it might be

758
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
The mask

759
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,080
I bet 20 million extra dead people than a year

760
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,640
And this is just the start

761
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
It's all coming up today

762
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,832
Any year I guess we'll check back in and see if

763
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,904
20 million additional people are dead

764
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
In the United States

765
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
From vaccines and such

766
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,584
And then will I consider all of the people who are like you got to you got to just

767
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
Do you know how often is Alex Wright

768
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
Ivory

769
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568
Ty Wilson right about it being a summer of Rage Devers on its over $40

770
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Collapse

771
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:38,432
Gold is the only thing to buy haha yeah I think he's been right

772
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
Obama is going to declare himself

773
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
King use the FEMA provisional government to bring a Muslim caliphate

774
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
After the government before that was Larry

775
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
True that was agreed with him

776
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,840
That wasn't Alex original.

777
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah the ring in ballots from North Korea

778
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,848
Trudog

779
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:10,432
Through the Panama Canal and nobody

780
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
Check the North Korean shifter

781
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
That sounds true

782
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
That sounds true

783
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,464
20 million additional deaths in the United

784
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,232
Spaceman

785
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
He just can't even moderate the you know it's over for Humanity I mean I guess 20 million is a conservative number

786
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Walter's over for Humanity right

787
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Sure

788
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,104
Yeah I mean lone survivors versus 22 koosman

789
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
The escalation

790
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
Deescalate

791
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Subways

792
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
A little bit later this route

793
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
Maybe more than 20 million specific number will check back in on that new year

794
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
How long it last

795
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
Alex talked a little bit more about Chris

796
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,096
A sign and get some of the details about

797
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
This guy Ron

798
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,912
11 days ago

799
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Versailles

800
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,544
Christopher Stine dead 45

801
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,896
So they were coming to kill him it was threatened to kill anyone today

802
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
TV

803
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Emmy

804
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
For those reporting on

805
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
What kind of sense does that make

806
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,928
That doesn't make any sense

807
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
The story about the clintons on the

808
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:31,072
Bill Clinton on the tarmac meeting with Loretta Lynch is so damaging to the globalist

809
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:35,168
That they have to kill this guy 5 years later after he reports it

810
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,240
But it's also supposed to be a story that would win an Emmy

811
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,360
That's kind of what I'm struggling with attention to the story

812
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,504
Entire media is like wow this is so good we're going to award you for rice

813
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Shrek the whole media is

814
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:57,696
Controlled by the globalist an independent thing

815
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:04,096
That is a tough reality for me to

816
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
M2 don't match up

817
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
The reality is the Christopher sign won an Emmy in 2040

818
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
2 years before the

819
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,520
Clinton story

820
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,336
Bruise coverage of the shooting of two police officers in Phoenix

821
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,688
He also want an Edward Murrow award for some of his reporting on serial killer

822
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Larson Phoenix

823
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,808
Alex just read a headline that he won an Emmy and he's assuming that it must be for the Clinton

824
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
Story even though that makes no sense when combined with other narratives that he's trying to push it at all

825
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,256
Cuz that's all we got

826
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:40,960
Just go after any winners is that like their secret duck there's a serial killers with that one weird thing you know

827
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,848
Exactly they got the treasure they all think they're doing it

828
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
That makes sense

829
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,200
Lookout Jon Hamm ever went one

830
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,272
Probably do Cranston

831
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,600
Stop with the Enemy Number One

832
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
That's all I know

833
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,768
We're just going to lose the Cranston

834
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
That's it

835
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:10,144
Yeah don't worry about Godzilla or

836
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
How many how many Emmys did Modern Family win

837
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
Alex talks about his own coverage

838
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Of crisp

839
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Resign staff

840
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
Jordans

841
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
In this

842
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,344
He wants to he wants to sort of change that the landscaper

843
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
What is prediction

844
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,208
Yes Papa

845
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
In the near future

846
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,816
Another prominent anti-establishment individuals

847
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
It's a message to everyone

848
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Myself

849
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
Matt

850
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Sound clip of himself saying that

851
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
It's not quite

852
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,895
He was saying that like

853
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,247
Maybe 2020 Patriot weirdos will be dead overnight

854
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Me and Tucker Maybe

855
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,367
You're going to be a little bit more specific then

856
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Anybody who

857
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,439
Might be

858
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,511
Hershey Everly related to a show

859
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
Right rice

860
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
In the past

861
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
McAfee does not

862
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Outfit the

863
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,959
Image of who Alex was talking about

864
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,239
In that

865
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
That episode

866
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
Please clap

867
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
Man this is it this is where everything falls

868
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
And so here is

869
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
The clip of myself

870
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Talking about this

871
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
A boy

872
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
10 days ago

873
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
The coal mines this guy was a big one

874
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,975
The next few days next few weeks

875
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
It's a message to threatened everybody to shut up

876
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
Tomorrow

877
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Welp

878
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,823
I'm not sure what's going on with the control room today

879
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
Hell I don't even have an idea at this point

880
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
You know for me

881
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Back up that clip

882
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
This again here I am

883
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
10 days ago with sugar on top

884
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
Okay so real quick

885
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Before you respond

886
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,559
Gary's him trying again the Q that card back up

887
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,119
I am

888
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,655
10 days ago with sugar on top

889
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,959
This guy was a big

890
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,287
The next few days next few weeks

891
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,871
It's a message the threatened everybody to shut up

892
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
Tomorrow

893
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:34,015
Oh I understand I sent you guys a full clip and somehow you didn't download them

894
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
Get here earlier I got a review

895
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
Every single clip

896
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,647
It's your job

897
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,463
You're talkin about doing your job

898
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,863
That's all your complaining about having to work the job you created for your

899
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,007
There's that but I think there's a secondary thing and that is that like he's recognizing that the people use

900
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Delegated these tasks

901
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
2

902
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,359
Doing their job except they are

903
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:03,199
I sent you a 10 second clip that he's 10-second

904
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,503
Maybe it doesn't feel like it to him

905
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,063
That is clearly the clip that you sent them

906
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,927
And if it doesn't say what he needed to say in the moment and is really mad he's laughing out its

907
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
He needs a time machine to go back

908
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,791
And tell himself to say what is going

909
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:24,191
To be best for his narrative because unfortunately he was talking out of his ass then and he's talking out of his ass now

910
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Buying his bath heino

911
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,823
Oh I understand I sent you guys a full clip and somehow you didn't download them

912
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,175
I just got to get here earlier I got to review every single clip

913
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
On this show

914
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,063
There aren't many reset the show

915
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
You're the worst

916
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm going to try to come back

917
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
Is all hell's breaking loose the wheels are coming off everything and

918
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Cuz of this clip that you played

919
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,863
Really really really really really really really trying

920
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
My bestie

921
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,919
Alrighty then

922
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
Well that is not how long that was

923
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
It was

924
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,951
It doesn't matter I'm here and I went over all this and I've got all this news

925
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
What does it even matter

926
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
What

927
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
Does it even

928
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Matter

929
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
The General Public

930
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
They don't care at all the time.

931
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Wow

932
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,519
That's up from 20 million now

933
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,591
Whiny baby

934
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:40,991
Please throw in the Middle East throwing a little fit because the clip didn't say how he set it up you set it up to extreme

935
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Extremely

936
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Didn't match those expectations

937
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
I know

938
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,647
Instead of dealing with that being like well you know maybe

939
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Baby I miss that that up or something used

940
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
Throwing a fit never was going to die

941
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,791
He's trying his best

942
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
So funny

943
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
What

944
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
I mean

945
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,447
How can you do with that

946
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,287
Fast how can you do it that fast how can you go from being like

947
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:08,127
The strongest we're going to fight this to Disneyland

948
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
This clip

949
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
I thought it was different

950
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Everybody's got

951
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
Going to die

952
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
I think that

953
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Good comedians

954
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
On stage

955
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
Will be able to respond to changing Dynamics in the audience

956
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
It's really fast it's almost like your job

957
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,887
Yeah it's like if you're on stage and you're in the middle of let's say a b or a story

958
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
And something happens in the audience so you need to respond to you can change

959
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:37,567
What you're doing in order to respond to that otherwise

960
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
It'll cause a wrench in the gears

961
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
You'll be doing a bad

962
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Experience doing stand-up

963
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
Like don't know that

964
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,135
Don't get how it's even possible that someone could do that

965
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:57,535
And I think with Alex he has that skill but in this world in this realm and that is covering up the

966
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,095
The appearance of that doesn't make sense

967
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,167
With an emotional Outburst that's really severe

968
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
And seems real

969
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
2 people who are tricked

970
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
Take a decent to your bed

971
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,591
We're all going to die that covers up the fuk up

972
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,663
Yep. The dynamic in the room changed in

973
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
He's responding

974
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,503
Blaming it on the staff job

975
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,063
So talking about who cares we're all going to die anyway

976
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,391
What's what's great about it is that

977
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
Part of you if you are a listener like if I'm

978
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
Part of the Infowars listeners

979
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
Living through this clip

980
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
I am assuming

981
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
I like I like calling it living

982
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
Exactly

983
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Alex

984
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,007
Does have the actual clip

985
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
But unfortunately couldn't

986
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,079
Play it because of

987
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,175
The impression that he wants.

988
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,503
It didn't say what it is he wanted

989
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
To have said

990
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,879
And part of the conveying that to the audience

991
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Is the

992
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Of the little

993
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Petulant meltdown

994
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Totally

995
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Totally

996
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Has nothing to do with it

997
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,375
It is nothing nothing nothing

998
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
What you guys

999
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
The same one

1000
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
Actually get that out do that

1001
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,895
Maybe I'm not supposed to be on there anymore maybe the show's most

1002
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
Walkaway

1003
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
Disappear

1004
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Yes

1005
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
Yes

1006
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
There's a hold it up

1007
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Do it

1008
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
Play all people to fold out the system

1009
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
Quit play love the death they love

1010
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
Destruction I love being full

1011
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:42,751
Because their followers because they're idiots because they're more on it

1012
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
That's really what all of this has

1013
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Come down to

1014
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
What is that

1015
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:09,375
Literally there's nothing you can read into that positive than him thinking

1016
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
People are going to assume I was mad about the quilt

1017
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
I was mad about the clip

1018
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
I got to tell people I wasn't mad about the clip

1019
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,127
The progression of thoughts

1020
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,175
You can hear while he's silent

1021
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
You can hear them

1022
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
In his brain

1023
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
A hundred percent

1024
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
Wow

1025
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,903
People are definitely going to assume it was about that clip better say it wasn't

1026
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Is clearly

1027
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
100 / 0

1028
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Unprofessional

1029
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,423
Let me see if I can get out in front of me

1030
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,823
Low Drop because he stole my food

1031
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
Not about the

1032
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
So he wants to cover the big

1033
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,367
The globalist declaration of war against humanity

1034
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
Going to do a good job for everybody

1035
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Comeback

1036
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
No one interested in Rio

1037
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
No one come in here it's almost like a

1038
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,239
All day long

1039
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,031
Once there's something going on it's like a

1040
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:26,431
Asking for is to be left alone in the studio

1041
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Muckleshoot videos

1042
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
Dial everybody

1043
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,343
But I just I need to just focus

1044
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
In my own little cocoon

1045
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
My show

1046
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
That's what Imma Try to do

1047
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:45,375
Is the present now that he's like to distracted by things that are going on in the studio

1048
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Discover his

1049
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
To do is drive I don't know

1050
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,543
It's so now I'm not mad about the clip let's pretend it's not about the

1051
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,103
The clip and it is actually about him being to distract

1052
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
Goodbye things that are going on

1053
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,919
That's still his fault

1054
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,295
He's cultivated the work environment that he has if it's not conducive to him getting his job done

1055
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
That's on him

1056
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Absolutely

1057
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,927
I feel no sympathy

1058
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:15,071
Just bring it back to to Comics like that that's like if you got the light in your likeness

1059
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
I can't do stand-up

1060
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,751
I can never tell a joke again

1061
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,055
Or people like in the audience

1062
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
Eating

1063
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,407
Food affected by you eating I can't tell jokes

1064
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,199
Subject drop happened and now it's

1065
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,783
All over the show end but it's actually different

1066
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Because you didn't

1067
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Start the

1068
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
The club

1069
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,159
You are the person who made the menu

1070
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:45,279
It made it so these people would be eating while you're trying to perform stand-up

1071
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,351
Why did I get so many cracklins

1072
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
So much

1073
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,959
Yeah that's the way to make that analog

1074
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
I don't know

1075
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
I don't know

1076
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
I think that this is sad

1077
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
To trying

1078
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,175
Lanza he's got this this clip

1079
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,991
He's trying to use as an argument that

1080
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Joe Biden

1081
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
Threatening to Nuke

1082
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
The Americans

1083
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,671
You notified made that comment about our you know if you're going to

1084
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
Having guns to fight

1085
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,327
The government makes no sense

1086
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,143
Build this up quite a bit about others like you

1087
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
He's going to Nuke

1088
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Can people

1089
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,775
Wright has going to require more congressional oversight

1090
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,895
Firing let's say the head of the IRS or nuking the American city

1091
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Probably IRS

1092
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
IRS2Go

1093
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
Alex builds that up any plays the

1094
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
The clip

1095
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Obiden

1096
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,111
It does not say

1097
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
Eclipse again

1098
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,767
No Alex does a different move that he usually does

1099
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
Mexico

1100
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,351
Like sort of an argument at the beginning

1101
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,911
Play music

1102
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,263
Completely different argument weekend because it doesn't say what he says it said

1103
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,615
Here's by The Imposter the stooge

1104
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,919
The puppet The Pretender

1105
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Destroyer

1106
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Death Rides a Horse

1107
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
Figuratively and literally

1108
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
Literally rides on a white horse

1109
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Basically

1110
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,143
Admitting interzone senile rage

1111
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
That we want your gun

1112
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,799
Don't worry I already wise we've got the news

1113
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
Military

1114
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,103
Is separate

1115
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
From the American people

1116
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
And that their plan is military action

1117
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,759
As if you use a nuclear weapon

1118
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
On a rebellion

1119
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
Yeah that is ridiculous

1120
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:47,903
The cities are

1121
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,463
60% Democrats

1122
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Dominic thiem

1123
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,167
Unless you meant new car major power production sites

1124
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,727
Turning off the apartment access

1125
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,799
They're already turning off our pipeline

1126
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,847
Destroying our borders bringing in

1127
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
Dependent populations they control

1128
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,575
We got nude your separate from us

1129
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
Second Amendment from the day of

1130
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Limited too

1131
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
What type of people could own a gun

1132
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
What type of weapon you could own

1133
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
You couldn't Buy Canon

1134
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
I was just say the blood

1135
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,727
The blood of patriots Eno

1136
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
C-nile rape

1137
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Move against the government

1138
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,919
The tree of Liberty is not water in the blood of patriots with

1139
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
Enter

1140
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,271
Never been if you wanted you think you need to

1141
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
Have weapons to take on the government

1142
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,135
Uniden 52 maybe some

1143
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
The point is that

1144
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
Abilities unlimited rationally limits

1145
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
What type of weapon that can be on

1146
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Buchanan

1147
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,215
So there you go

1148
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
The Democrat

1149
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,871
You see a completely different

1150
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,455
Point being made after the video because I had nothing to do

1151
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,503
With the story that I was telling about

1152
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Always

1153
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Act militarily on the people

1154
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
Add point that Biden was making

1155
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
That there's always been limitations

1156
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
To what sorts

1157
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,559
The Weaponry people can own for safety reasons

1158
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
Yeah that's just a

1159
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,167
Mental abuse stay to do that and then

1160
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Make that Whiplash change as if you didn't

1161
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:44,127
I think honestly I was just review the clips before he comes you know he should listen

1162
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,919
Every clip

1163
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,015
You just have all this dissonance going on

1164
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,159
Sounds kind of realizes after pivoting to the side what fighting sexual point is

1165
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,463
It's a response to that I'd

1166
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
And of course you can

1167
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
No crime is that

1168
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
1 G

1169
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
Readysub

1170
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,127
Alex is trying to define a 50 caliber as a

1171
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
And even though he even refers to it as a rifle

1172
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,247
I think he knows that this is a dishonest Ark

1173
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
Also in terms

1174
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,391
The crimes being committed with 50 caliber rifles I was actually able to find a House of Representatives

1175
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Newport from 1999

1176
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
Specifically about crimes

1177
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,999
Committed with 50 caliber rifle

1178
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
This report.

1179
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,327
It's time to track with Alex's narrative

1180
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,935
But part of the reason for that is it 50 caliber rifles are very inconvenient

1181
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
In terms of committing most crimes

1182
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,311
Most of them are so large that you need to have them propped up on a stand for

1183
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
For shooting purpose

1184
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:52,735
Which is why most of the instances of crimes associated with 50 caliber rifles in this government report are related to disrupted

1185
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,503
Criminal plot

1186
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:59,135
There's a piece of a West Virginia Mountaineer militia member was plotting to bomb an FBI office wedding

1187
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
50 caliber rifle in his home

1188
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
When it was searched

1189
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
Exam

1190
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:08,351
The majority of people mentioned in this report had the fifty-cal at home but would use smaller more convenient weapon

1191
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
Pens for away games

1192
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,167
Yeah yeah

1193
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,703
Cuz cuz

1194
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
Said Alex is still just lying

1195
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
1 case

1196
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,591
What happened in 2015 what a man and his son

1197
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:22,687
Greg and Jason niedermeyer fired on a sheriff's office volunteer

1198
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,479
Enid him three times

1199
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,855
The officer lived but it's unclear if he 50 caliber that was being shot at him worthy bullets that I can

1200
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:36,255
We hit him but wouldn't not unclear is at the 50 caliber definitely was shot at him he's at

1201
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:42,399
Christ in his when he was fleeing in his vehicle

1202
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
Is that is

1203
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,983
That is functionally the most terrifying

1204
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
And Candice ever existed

1205
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,871
That officer had been part of an interagency group at it uncovered a marijuana grow site

1206
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:55,199
Arizona where they also found a ton of guns and pipe bomb

1207
00:57:55,967 --> 00:58:00,063
An ATV was seen speeding away from their location and this officer followed it

1208
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
What turned out to be the neidermeyer's home

1209
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,671
As soon as he exited his vehicle they started shooting at him

1210
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
I mean

1211
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:11,327
It's upgrade tracks the only reason that you would have a gun that big is to commit

1212
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,095
A big

1213
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:15,935
Crockett right so it requires more planning

1214
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,543
Not always snow I like walking into a f******

1215
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,847
7-Eleven over with the 5th

1216
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,319
In 2013 a man named Adam wickenheiser was arrested after shooting his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend

1217
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:38,207
The shooting the victim had called the police to say that way cuz her was on his own front porch with a rifle

1218
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:43,327
And quote well cops were on their way dispatchers heard a shot and a scream and the connection shut off

1219
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,191
So what happened is that he had a 50 caliber it and he was pointing it at this guy

1220
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:54,079
Allegedly just trying to scare him that'll scare you

1221
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
Wow that's not

1222
00:58:55,103 --> 00:59:01,247
Scary 2004 guy named Marvin heemeyer bulldozer with a

1223
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
Caliber mounted on it

1224
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,415
He was mad about zoning issues in city code so we went off in quote plowed the armor-plated bulldozer

1225
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Townhall

1226
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
The former mayor's home and at least five other building

1227
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,071
I mean in some ways

1228
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:21,471
I respect that he shot himself rather than get arrested and the fifty-caliber wasn't actually use specifically in the crime

1229
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:27,871
Mounted on his armored bulldozer so I think that couch

1230
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,271
You're the only person running the bulldozer I mean you would need somebody up there

1231
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Evernote

1232
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,367
There are plenty of other examples but I think the point is made and nothing

1233
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,671
Is going to top a crazy homemade armored bulldozer

1234
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,695
It just doesn't get better than

1235
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,815
Just2good 50 caliber rifles are rarely used in explicit

1236
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,655
Violent acts because other weapons are just as effective and easier to wheel

1237
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:56,543
However they are very often found in as part of the home collections of criminals

1238
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
Been there sometimes used in crimes

1239
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,663
What Elsa saying is just an old NRA talking

1240
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,455
Pinpoint that he's internalized is truth

1241
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,247
Because he's an idiot and a zealot

1242
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,831
Has brainwashed as ever any claims up the on the left

1243
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
The bunch of Dante

1244
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
I get

1245
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,159
So tired of

1246
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Same argument

1247
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Being convincing enough

1248
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
4

1249
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
These types of

1250
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Like

1251
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,607
If here's the thing

1252
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,423
If somebody gave me an argument that I

1253
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
New

1254
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
Was the exact same argument

1255
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
From the 60s

1256
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
That they tried

1257
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
I would say

1258
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
We don't care about that idea anymore

1259
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
We tried and it didn't work and these people are just like

1260
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
I know

1261
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
It didn't work last

1262
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
But maybe it'll work now

1263
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,743
And next year and the year after that and the year after that and the year after that and then they've been so brainwashed by it there's just knows things

1264
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
I love hearing it they love

1265
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Tahir

1266
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Guns are the best

1267
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:58,239
I think that's how you change a little bit of

1268
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,031
Little bit of aesthetic

1269
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
You change the shirt

1270
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:06,175
That the wiring or whatever you can pass it off as brand new

1271
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,711
I think Alex does a bunch of that

1272
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Leprechaun

1273
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,503
Conspiracy

1274
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
Culture like really

1275
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
Does a lot of that work

1276
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Yeah

1277
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
Yeah I mean though you've attended

1278
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:18,463
Again it's just that macro all over again you know

1279
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,607
You switch the Black Panther fatigues for a BLM shirt and you're just you're still like a their communist infiltrators

1280
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,167
Did the Democrats are bringing in from other countries

1281
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
To replace us

1282
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
Sure we said that in the 90

1283
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
Sure we said that in the 80

1284
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
Are we said that

1285
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
7260

1286
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
250

1287
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,455
Shore we did that

1288
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Now it's

1289
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,039
If you bring that example up and that's very fitting

1290
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
Cuz at this point Alex

1291
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,647
Gets into critical race Theory

1292
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:53,023
God no I'm not even taking this seriously as legitimate

1293
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
Argument

1294
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
That is being made

1295
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:00,703
What Alex is responding to is that clip of General milley

1296
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,007
Yeah saying that he wants

1297
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,543
To understand white rage

1298
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,687
Yadunnadi understands you know he reads a lot of things about theory is whether or not he necessarily believes

1299
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,455
Is there true

1300
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,503
Shores value in understanding

1301
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
All kinds of

1302
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
People's perspective

1303
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,855
Yes he said education is important

1304
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
The conservatives

1305
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:23,231
So Alex

1306
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
Has some real problems

1307
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
With

1308
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
General milley

1309
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
You're at some of the other

1310
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Brass

1311
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
Anybody who does

1312
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,215
Some say white people are the best and everybody else should die

1313
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,031
Apparently they're putting a bunch of black generals

1314
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
In charge because they're going to take the guns

1315
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,383
And then you're racist if you resist

1316
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,247
Black

1317
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
Across the country

1318
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
And the national

1319
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
German 2.0

1320
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,095
Is General Honore on record

1321
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,911
War on white people and gun owners

1322
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,519
Matter what you'll be a white supremacist

1323
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
You don't turn them over

1324
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
Always always

1325
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
That's what you said

1326
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
So yours didn't say any other

1327
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,855
It's so funny it's just so funny

1328
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,159
How obvious this is just because

1329
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
The moment

1330
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
People started talking about critical race

1331
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,023
The conservatives

1332
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,839
Reveal exactly why it's important

1333
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
By reacting in such a white nationalist way

1334
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
Immediate responses you're trying to kill white people hit send your likes to get why we need

1335
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
The theory

1336
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
Two little telling

1337
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,151
And I think honestly

1338
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
I would ask

1339
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,503
Any of these people who are complaining

1340
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Sing about

1341
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
This idea this Theory

1342
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
What is a

1343
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:59,231
They don't get an answer

1344
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,279
Reference to what

1345
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
The Theory actually is

1346
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
What weather roots of it are

1347
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,215
Anything other than white people are bad

1348
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,543
That's all that's only thing that he thinks

1349
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
This involves

1350
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
Nonsense

1351
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
You know Millie

1352
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Austin

1353
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Is generals

1354
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
The traitors

1355
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,551
Trader

1356
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
They're planning false flag

1357
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Nothing

1358
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,879
This country

1359
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,439
250 years history has never

1360
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
Traders

1361
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
Exonerate

1362
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
And Nelly

1363
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Austin

1364
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,863
These men once they've been politically

1365
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,887
Call Shirley

1366
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
Economically

1367
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,471
And he's in the criminal justice system defeated

1368
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,543
Will be known as

1369
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
The new definition of Benedict Arnold

1370
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,575
Call Slugterra tax here in America

1371
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
They're spoiling

1372
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
They're spoiling

1373
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,767
They're spoiling to overthrow

1374
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
And they're getting ready

1375
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,887
To carry out Terror attacks that is there

1376
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,703
Can be blamed on those of us they're loyal American

1377
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
So yeah we got

1378
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
I just

1379
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,335
All the time

1380
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
All the time

1381
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Conservatives are just

1382
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,247
Empty of everything but whiteness and guns now

1383
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
You do like

1384
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
Dare you disrespect the military

1385
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:33,695
Generals are all Traders and we should kill them like Jesus

1386
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,487
Christ there is nothing

1387
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
Is empty of whiteness

1388
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
And just

1389
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
What does a gun

1390
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,399
I agree at least from like the perspective of this

1391
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,727
This branch of the media absolutely

1392
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,287
Insane nonsensical

1393
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
But primalix specifically like

1394
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,663
I just don't understand how he feels like he can get any purchase out of like predict

1395
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
False flag

1396
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,479
It happens all the time

1397
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
NeverEnding

1398
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Prediction

1399
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,367
Ignore that you've made last week and the week before

1400
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
Outrageous

1401
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:09,791
It's a it's like you got to update you know it's like when you've got an album and the release date

1402
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:16,191
Keep getting pushed back it's like he's hitting the smooth alarm clock that is exactly what it is

1403
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Business news

1404
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,287
Cuz that all just plays white nonsense

1405
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:25,151
We need to get members of Congress in the military

1406
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
And then

1407
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,759
General milley General Washington General Honore

1408
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:38,719
We want to start out with the American people

1409
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:58,943
Frustrated trying to get business capital

1410
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,759
Is that what Alex was

1411
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:06,367
Maybe commercial

1412
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Somebody to work

1413
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,695
He's fake mad though

1414
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,535
So it's a Marxist plan this critical race Theory

1415
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:19,935
God Marxist even argue that Alex is making a compelling defense for

1416
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
My point

1417
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,519
Which is that if you don't read or engaged with critical

1418
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
Call Sierra Reis Siri

1419
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
You probably

1420
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,943
If you responded this knee-jerk

1421
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,503
Then maybe

1422
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:40,159
They're only because we immediately react in a way that would suggest we believe in

1423
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
The supremacy of white people

1424
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
Its side

1425
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
It's sort of telling on yourself a little bit

1426
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Any continues

1427
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:53,983
Seen it

1428
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
General milley

1429
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,639
And general Austin all the rest of these guys

1430
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,991
Up there with just such demonic looks on their faces

1431
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,783
Hateful towards Congress

1432
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
Critical role

1433
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,647
Siri that is a marxist-leninist globalist

1434
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,975
Liberation theology

1435
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,535
Did you read it

1436
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,327
This is pure poison

1437
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
I meant to say

1438
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:23,935
AR white members of military have to be asked whether they're good people or not

1439
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,239
That is so racist show evil

1440
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
Was that

1441
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:31,359
I just see the enjoyment of Millie and the enjoyment of Austin

1442
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,175
Knowing this is our takeover plan in there in on

1443
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,479
Conquerors

1444
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,551
To see them abuse their position but

1445
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
It's just it's it's it's

1446
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,463
I mean

1447
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:51,839
That that f****** refrain of everything they say we're doing is what they're doing

1448
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,703
And then he says that all the white members of the military are going to have to be asked how they think

1449
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:02,591
Not true in Florida all the students are going to be asked what they think because of the Republican Governor like

1450
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,639
Stop saying that you're doing

1451
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,551
Blood-curdling

1452
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,439
Frustrating to be guess what on a national stage so you know what you know what gets my Goose all say

1453
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
You know I have a line

1454
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
In the sand

1455
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,607
Critical race Theory should not be

1456
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,911
Preschoolers

1457
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,775
I honestly disagree you got to wrestle with those Concepts from the

1458
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Get eggs

1459
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
You know you do

1460
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,503
Clifford the Big Red Dog should be entirely about race relations people learn Edition

1461
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831

Critical race Theory to preschool

1463
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,655
How I do I don't know I don't know

1464
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
Well I mean

1465
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,519
Alex doesn't know what anything is

1466
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
You still mad

1467
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
True

1468

1469
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,783
Preschools

1470
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
That they're bad because they're white

I'm sure

1474
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,279
The General

1475
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,583
The capital was

1476
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,495
Oh I don't think it's hard to figure out

1477
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
Text the froggy election are right to do it

1478
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
Help

8560

1480
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
White supremacist

1481
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879
All of America is

1482
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
And you're the big

1483
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
U.s. military

1484
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,583
You got the nukes in the F-15

1485
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
The shows the gun owners

1486
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,471
I think Alex just embodied that thing

1487
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,103
This is an example of why this is important

1488
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
There you go

1489
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,711
Critical race theory about teaching children that it's bad to be white

1490
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,039
We were talking about

1491
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
But this

1492
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,231
Particular brand of Rage that Alex

1493
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,255
Drawings of bodies

1494
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
It is not all just racial

1495
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Sometimes

1496
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
It's homophobic

1497
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:37,215
Military

1498
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,031
They're controlled at their enthusiastic

1499
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
Fetishize

1500
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Nelly

1501
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
And others

1502
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,967
When they were all working against him just like

1503
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,319
Dog Mattis called mad dog is he such a homosexual or whatever

1504
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,671
But

1505
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
That's who these guys are

1506
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
What

1507
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,935
They blackmail him with that

1508
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,031
Mad Dog Mattis

1509
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
Everything they say about a frog

1510
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,871
Dog sees a madtree

1511
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,687
Would a coup against the president their sacks

1512
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,759
All American

1513
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:33,023
Really was a Green Beret

1514
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
Convince me by their fruits

1515
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:43,007
I would say that if you apply the standard of judging people by their fruits to Alex's guests

1516
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
I don't think he would like it

1517
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,615
You probably have to disown all of them

1518
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
I think you should

1519
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
How old is Steve

1520
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Connect stand up to the

1521
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,551
Judge a man by his fruit stats

1522
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,623
Apparently

1523
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,183
You can't judge him by his fruits because you will be killed

1524
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:04,767
Write his Global team

1525
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,815
World shatterer

1526
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,607
Fruits

1527
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:13,471
But he's taking responsibility for literally everything every never happened to geopolitics

1528
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,519
Assassination

1529
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Tons of that

1530
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Overthrowing governments

1531
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,895
The coos

1532
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:26,783
Not good fruit explain to me imaginary fruits of my

1533
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
It's like

1534
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:35,487
Steve pieczenik is the only person who is actively claimed to have already committed koos

1535
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:42,143
And I'm here

1536
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
Supposed to sit here and be like

1537
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,263
The people who work for the government are starting a coup

1538
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,311
Me and the person who commits

1539
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,639
Coues rap

1540
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:57,247
He's doing a koobits only because the other two

1541
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,807
Counters are we on now

1542
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,831
Who knows

1543
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,671
How about Leo zagami has his first

1544
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
We got the popo

1545
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,167
Yeah it's so he is a Jesus apparently that's true

1546
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:19,007
Good fruits that mean nobody's born better for its Benji's

1547
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:24,383
How about Rodger Stone in his North Korean ballad boats

1548
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
You don't even need the imaginary fruits of Rodger Stone

1549
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,319
Enough about how evil that

1550
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,367
Alex's recently made friends

1551
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
Mike Lindell

1552
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
He's got some

1553
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:39,743
Interesting fruit best pillows in the world

1554
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Haha

1555
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
Shark

1556
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
Hello

1557
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
Fruit salad

1558
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:52,287
Is not not a not edible

1559
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,871
Passion fruit and kiwi

1560
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,967
Together to the problem though is V the army and

1561
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,735
The services

1562
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,527
Is that the problem

1563
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
Wokeness

1564
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Wokeness

1565
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
God you're just

1566
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,903
White yes all you're mad about

1567
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
Yeah

1568
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:15,071
This is one of the satyr add pivots I've heard in awhile

1569
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,095
It's just you can experience

1570
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Is a bummer

1571
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
Cuz you're the one

1572
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
Person with all the corporation

1573
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,007
University

1574
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:27,359
And a whole system in Hollywood behind you to mess with our kids

1575
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,247
Text censoring everybody in the rest of it

1576
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
Totally disgusting

1577
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,367
Alright I have a plugged yet I'm just going to tell you this right now

1578
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Wow

1579
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,583
Yikes

1580
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,191
Oh yeah that's the other part of understanding white rage

1581
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,007
Which is ultimately when you get down to the bottom of it

1582
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,567
You just have to remember it's a bunch of people whining

1583
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,151
That white people aren't running everything and everything is

1584
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,687
For that

1585
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,247
Yep there seem to be a bit of that

1586
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,551
Talking about McAfee

1587
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Exciting

1588
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,535
Immediate video that you put out the evidence that Alex presented is all that

1589
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
Tweets

1590
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Just treats

1591
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,375
Suspiciously

1592
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:26,239
The next day we have a new piece of evidence have Alex's attic

1593
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
Do I do well

1594
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,151
He personally told me the last time we talked on the phone

1595
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
Couple years ago

1596
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,527
Before I leave strong in that Madrid prison for no reason wedding

1597
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
Reset my brain

1598
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,887
A.m.

1599
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,127
Barcelona

1600
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Barcelona

1601
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
Barcelona

1602
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
And I said go check his Twitter

1603
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
Siri said he would never commit suicide

1604
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
Wait

1605
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
You said

1606
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,415
Yeah he told

1607
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
Do you don't need the Twitter

1608
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,975
He told you first

1609
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:25,631
What does the van that Alex now gets to have with taking over the certified personal stories

1610
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,167
There's just enough

1611
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,703
Connection between them.

1612
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:32,287
Plausible that McAfee and him have had private conversation

1613
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,871
Just say whatever you want to be like you said that to me on the phone

1614
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:42,527
We are gradually getting closer and closer to my best friend

1615
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,879
We've been together for 30 years I was in Belize exactly

1616
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:53,279
Define well-being

1617
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:58,911
I'm really well we were close

1618
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,447
We texted all the time

1619
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,775
We were in a rotisserie baseball league

1620
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
Houston survivors veterans

1621
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,175
Yep

1622
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
So Alex Compares this of course to the death of Andrew Breitbart

1623
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,719
Alex is not brushed up on the Breitbart death narratives

1624
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,767
Eddie confuses some of the details

1625
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,815
Breitbart

1626
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
2 hours at the hospital

1627
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
Never say that they didn't say that

1628
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,447
The media lie

1629
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,775
He had information

1630
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Absolutely horrible

1631
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:44,991
Motor good friends all the time

1632
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,063
He said they might kill me their answer me

1633
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
Follow me but screw them

1634
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
Tell himself

1635
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:56,767
Ugly to Breitbart didn't kill himself he didn't kill him know I'm saying he killed him

1636
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,559
Alex is screwing up the details of

1637
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,839
Conspiracy theory

1638
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:04,191
The story was the Breitbart was killed because he had a video that would take down Barack Obama

1639
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,751
Presumably evidence that he was a radical communist

1640
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,775
Extremist

1641
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,103
The conspiracy was never about Hillary but the real version of the Breitbart

1642
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,407
Conspiracy isn't going to move the needle at this point

1643
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:18,271
Hillary is more interesting in the satanism

1644
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,831
MacGuffin

1645
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,647
Breitbart had that needed to be silenced

1646
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,463
Bounces just completely screwing up even what the

1647
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,999
Does the stories were

1648
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,559
I think it's kind of funny

1649
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,351
I think it's kind of funny how most

1650
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,167
Conspiracy theories about Obama have just

1651
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
Faded

1652
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,263
You know like they're all in the background now it's

1653
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031
Its back

1654
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,847
The Clinton somehow yeah you know like that

1655
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:49,247
Obama was President at your short while ago and you hated that guy but I think I think that they've been

1656
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,599
Transitional lot of the Obama conspiracies into actually being Clinton

1657
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Yeah

1658
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,415
It's sort of a sub-branch

1659
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:01,791
Bostwick Landon has a connection to both of them so you can kind of triangulate there

1660
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,327
But I mean it's just

1661
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,143
And Bill and Hillary are secretly running me biting Administration

1662
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
As well

1663
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,215
Like the only people who f***

1664
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
I hate Obama now or the left

1665
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,592
We're the only ones who've gotten together and re-evaluated men like

1666
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
We were

1667
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,504
Still very much dislike Obama passionately

1668
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
That the left

1669
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
Have

1670
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,368
Critiques and criticisms of a lot of policies that Obama

1671
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,392
Infected

1672
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
You could have done better about

1673
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
And hippos

1674
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,768
Presidential life as well

1675
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
I don't think that

1676
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,096
Any president is going to have

1677
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,144
A real great time after their present

1678
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
I think

1679
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:45,056
Well I think his life to helping others

1680
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,896
But I also still think that he took it on the chin quite a bit about

1681
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,456
Denotes the economic

1682
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,088
Impact as an officer I think that you're not going to ever have

1683
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,880
Smooth sailing afterwards

1684
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Probably not

1685
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:04,000
Mary middle maybe that's how many people should expect when they when they get in

1686
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,792
Totally I get you get you get

1687
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,096
Khushi speaking gigs but also

1688
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:13,216
A lot of people are not going to like you if you're the president of the United States

1689
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:17,568
So generally speaking it's something that maybe we should have our President should be in the

1690
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Sure

1691
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
We are I just I think

1692
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
I think

1693
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,480
Your ear comment is is

1694
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Cool noted

1695
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,576
I think the left doesn't

1696
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Hate Obama

1697
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
They have

1698
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
Critiques of him

1699
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:37,280
But some might border on strong dislike and I'm sure there are some people who do hate

1700
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,864
That's true

1701
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:47,008
I'm just saying he's not the Forefront of the

1702
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
The Brunt

1703
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Have a special place in their heart

1704
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Man

1705
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Yeah

1706
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
Well it's because

1707
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,480
Like the clintons were the big bad guys

1708
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
The time when

1709
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:02,880
Things were pretty fun for the bad guy Grant was really popping off at

1710
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:09,536
Limbaugh was going ham on everybody all the newsletters and everything kind of secret

1711
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,936
And they were in their clubs yeah and the groundwork has been laid so for so many years that

1712
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,752
But they're still available

1713
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:23,360
Easier to actually be a white supremacist or Nazi back then yeah cuz like

1714
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:30,016
Didn't you just got away with it you and your buddies hung out in the garage and murder

1715
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Yeah you talk

1716
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
The good old days

1717
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,464
Alex seems to believe that

1718
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,768
Pentagon has declared war

1719
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,048
Shawnee American people

1720
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,584
That sounds weird

1721
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,448
Just a conversation about a guy having read Theory before but also

1722
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Dojo

1723
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,104
Well that's a good idea that's a good idea

1724
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,640
Boron

1725
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,408
Yes

1726
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
Be cool okay

1727
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,760
That's really comforting to know

1728
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
Sit out

1729
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Speaker

1730
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,672
So a 9 is starting to kill

1731
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,976
Anybody promise everybody to shut up

1732
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
I have the real take over

1733
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,424
John Didion South Vietnam before they had a big offensive

1734
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
I'm not picking sides in that war I'm just saying

1735
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,872
Wait what you're not today

1736
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,920
Vietnam

1737
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,480
When they thought was sympathizing

1738
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,016
With the North Vietnamese

1739
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,576
How do you say killing everybody Grandpa

1740
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,392
Made the Vietnamese go get the fetal position and cry to Mommy

1741
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:43,744
So

1742
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:48,096
There's a difference you're not going to have

1743
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,704
It's going to be here

1744
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,664
Weather now

1745
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
And they think we're such cowards

1746
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
And when this attack against us

1747
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
I don't want

1748
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,232
I want this to stop

1749
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,840
They're all Munoz the official battle doctrine of US Army

1750
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
And the military is not America

1751
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
I hope

1752
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:32,128
I hope to stop at the last thing we need is any offense of violence

1753
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Wow

1754
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:39,296
Well done God has declared war on the American people

1755
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,696
Military to get mad about it

1756
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:49,280
I don't want you to eat

1757
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,840
Just keep your mouth shut

1758
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,120
But understand this

1759
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
2 minutes to exit

1760
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,008
To sit there

1761
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,312
We killed 50 million babies

1762
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,872
We let pedophiles teacher kids in school

1763
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,688
We how we worship the devil maybe it's God's plan

1764
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
Wait

1765
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,016
This is this is a mess okay

1766
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
Alright

1767
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Okay

1768
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,112
Pentagons declared war on America

1769
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,672
He said that multiple times multiple times

1770
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,000
He does point out he doesn't want offensive Island be cool

1771
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
I don't want any offensive violin

1772
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,072
2 minutes execution

1773
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:27,168
The Pentagon has declared war on America

1774
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Okay

1775
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Energy Services

1776
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:36,896
You don't want to you don't want to let them know that you're going to take over your car not absolutely not

1777
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:43,296
It's 9:58 so what I want you to do is wait a minute and a half

1778
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,088
45 but that might be too long

1779
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,440
Okay

1780
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,464
Just

1781
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
Dissonance

1782
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
To the point of

1783
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,424
How can I how can I live in a space where I

1784
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,776
Being actively murdered any moment now

1785
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,104
And also also I should just wait

1786
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
Be cool

1787
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
I know it's

1788
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:14,272
It's been an emotional state that he wants the audience today

1789
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
It's just a

1790
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,576
Beatdown

1791
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,952
So Alex almost started the show covering news about how covid-19 Italy created in a lab

1792
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,232
He's really close to do

1793
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,304
I'm now back to my adventurous listen

1794
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
Coming to this Azan

1795
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,448
Infowars listener is this the story that Alex is talking about earlier

1796
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:37,568
You know I almost started all broadcast today just wouldn't leave

1797
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:42,432
Over the top news on covid being cooked in a lab released on purpose

1798
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,296
It is over the top

1799
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,136
Depending on who you are politically you won't be allowed outside

1800
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Wor

1801
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,768
House under future lockdown

1802
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,352
Has martial law digital passes

1803
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:04,192
Caught outside without your phone tracking where you do what you do

1804
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
You're permanently

1805
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,544
Martial law.

1806
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,104
Hell on Earth

1807
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
So is this

1808
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,176
Story is I don't I don't know if this is

1809
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
This doesn't seem like

1810
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,992
The same story but it did

1811
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:17,760
The beginning of the key

1812
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
I don't know

1813
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,088
I don't know anything

1814
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,392
This is a tacit admission

1815
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,184
That the mark of the beast

1816
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,256
Because he's even just pointed it out

1817
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,304
If you're outside without your phone

1818
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,608
They can track you and find you at any point

1819
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,400
That's what he said

1820
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,240
Oh so weird

1821
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,288
We're done with the mark of the beast forever

1822
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,336
He's proven it the mark of the beast is happen

1823
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
When did happen

1824
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,712
When the iPod first came out 20 years ago everybody go back to flip phone

1825
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,808
Having a better understanding of what that story was

1826
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Bobcat

1827
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
I don't know

1828
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,952
How much time on it cuz he's got to get back

1829
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Do McAfee

1830
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,560
Conspiracy like more details on how I

1831
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,096
Deemed politically

1832
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:04,864
Play correct enough

1833
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,984
Okay 100 step-by-step process

1834
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,800
Well the first thing is you've got to understand

1835
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:18,176
The McAfee was murdered

1836
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,712
Madrid

1837
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Yesterday

1838
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,528
Walmart

1839
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
What

1840
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
Just so happen to happen

1841
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,536
Homeland Security

1842
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,584
Barcelona

1843
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
Elizabeth federal prison that he had billions in b

1844
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Pointer

1845
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,824
But we do know is his lawyer says no indication of suicide

1846
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
He just talk

1847
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
Talk to him

1848
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Hayes before

1849
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,920
Alex is actually correct

1850
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:55,552
Activity head of Homeland Security was on an official state visit to Spain at that time so I guess that

1851
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
Improves it well he was in Madrid

1852
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:04,256
Ed so naturally he had plenty of time to just sneak down to Barcelona murder McAfee and then

1853
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:10,400
Sneak back us to Madrid country therefore you murdered him yeah absolutely no instructed I have no response

1854
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:15,776
Noah murder happened in Austin and I am here in Chicago or in the same country I don't drop it yeah I did it

1855
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:20,128
As far as Maccabees lawyer goes this is another classic case of Alex reading a headline in

1856
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,408
Pretending that he's read the

1857
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:27,296
There was a Reuters article with the headline quote lawyer saw no sign that software mobile McAfee would kill him

1858
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,904
And Alex is assuming with the body of the article must be about how the lawyer saying that it wasn't

1859
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:38,560
In reality who's lawyer Xavier villalba was the person who made the initial statement to Reuters

1860
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:44,192
Maxis lawyer Javier Villalobos said that the antivirus software Pioneer died by hanging

1861
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,216
It is 9 months

1862
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
Prison Broad

1863
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Him to despair

1864
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,848
This article is just villalba commenting that he didn't see any signs

1865
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Is that this would come

1866
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
The pass

1867
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,760
Villanova and Maccabees widow or pursuing an investigation into the circumstances of his death but

1868
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,576
According to an ABC News article about the case quote

1869
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,464
Although vilaubi said that he had no evidence of any Foul Play he blamed the death on quote the cruelty of the system

1870
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:11,584
We're keeping a seventy-five-year-old behind bars for economic and not blood related crimes

1871
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,888
After a judge has refused to release him on bail

1872
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,472
It seems to me that's the approach that he's going with

1873
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,008
In terms of re-examining

1874
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,848
The death fine I mean in terms of

1875
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,408
Incarceration

1876
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
Let's take a look at things

1877
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,832
I am not not for Mcafee sake but for the sake of the larger

1878
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
The larger issue in

1879
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,440
I mean I think that America certainly has some issues

1880
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,232
With that this was in Spain

1881
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,280
I'm not entirely sure how the

1882
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,096
Spanish prison system is I don't know enough about it

1883
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,912
Me neither and I don't know what I personally would

1884
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
Be able to do to make an impact

1885
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,264
Yeah I mean this situated

1886
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,664
It's so unique just because yes I know I don't agree that a seventy-five-year-old should be in a

1887
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,432
Prison

1888
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,968
For financial crimes

1889
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,504
And at the same time

1890
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
It's John McAfee

1891
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,576
If you let him out of prison

1892
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:09,184
He's not going to be in your ear country anymore is going to be able to quote

1893
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
I'm sorry

1894
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,512
I don't know what to tell you

1895
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,048
It out like there's no solution

1896
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Open for John McAfee

1897
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,144
I don't have

1898
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
I like a light.

1899
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,704
Circumstance

1900
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
That's with him

1901
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,240
You don't like that

1902
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,312
I just don't I understand that

1903
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,360
You know there are crimes and

1904
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
There are rules

1905
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
Somehow those crimes are

1906
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,968
We want to talk about

1907
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,504
Different ways in which

1908
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
Law and Punishment

1909
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Works

1910
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,856
I'm open to that conversation

1911
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:41,696
If John McAfee had gotten out of his Spanish prison

1912
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:46,304
Because they didn't want to extradited to the United States Penny ended up back on his boat

1913
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,864
I don't know if I would think that was the worst

1914
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,936
He's a crazy old dude on a boat right

1915
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,472
Play grated Maybe

1916
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,312
He did kill his people

1917
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
Baby

1918
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,480
I don't know I think my my just immediate reaction to anything about this is just like

1919
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
Everybody

1920
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,600
Made their decisions and I have no input and I wash my hands of this

1921
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,904
Specific circumstance

1922
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Is its own circuit

1923
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,232
Smell if

1924
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
The conversation that the lawyer is bringing up about

1925
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,888
How Financial crimes are dealt with

1926
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Particularly in the case

1927
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,960
If somebody was 75 years old

1928
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,776
Maybe there's a conversation to have there

1929
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:31,104
Just need to be because of McAfee should be because of

1930
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:35,200
All-weather chameleons of people have been f***** over by the person

1931
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:37,504
So Alex brings up the tweet

1932
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,296
He wants to go over the evidence

1933
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,368
Really just Refresh on the evidence of McAfee

1934
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:49,024
And this is this is a really read between this is a pretty sad display on Alex's

1935
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Remember he said

1936
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,864
I am content here

1937
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,448
The food is good all is well

1938
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,776
Know that if I hang myself I lie Epstein

1939
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,336
No fault of mine

1940
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
Refers to that prison

1941
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,408
In October of 2020

1942
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,808
So this tweet is really the Keystone of Alex's argument dishonest but Alex doesn't strive to put the statement in

1943
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:12,576
The proper

1944
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,672
For instance if Alex were an honest actor just trying to present the

1945
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,512
You should point out that this tweet he does say that it's from last October

1946
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,072
But he doesn't point out that on April twenty

1947
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
Play 5th of this year

1948
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,144
McAfee also tweeted quote

1949
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,960
I've been imprisoned in Catalonia nearly seven months

1950
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,544
I speak no cattle Annie and little Spanish so human contact is limited

1951
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,080
There no entertainment

1952
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
It's no escape from loneliness

1953
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
From emptiness

1954
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
From myself

1955
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,456
That tweet alone presented

1956
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Departure from the map

1957
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,760
Call Sadie was in when he posted

1958
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,040
Did that tweet in October

1959
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:47,904
I would never bring up this other tree because it calls into question the certainty of his predetermine

1960
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
Conclusion

1961
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,720
And selling that conclusion is

1962
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:52,768
If the certainty is ever question

1963
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:57,120
It wouldn't survive any kind of scrutiny and less you enter into the

1964
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,400
Active scrutinizing

1965
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,960
Already decided of the conclusion then

1966
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,008
Yeah so they just

1967
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,288
Do you got this

1968
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:09,920
Yeah it's like hey eight months ago he tweeted I'll never kill myself for months ago he tweeted

1969
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:15,808
I live in Despair and life is meaningless for me and I don't want to go into Escape From Myself

1970
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Actually it's like well

1971
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,160
So Alex wants to read this more recent

1972
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
And

1973
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
Doesn't come up with

1974
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,024
He's saying

1975
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,840
My wife. My sack I guess I lost it

1976
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,984
8 days ago

1977
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,848
I want to go back eight days ago

1978
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,408
Where the most important one is about

1979
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,456
They may be planning to kill me cuz that's

1980
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,760
The last known communication from him

1981
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,040
Is that an age cutoff

1982
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,880
Selected files on corruption in government

1983
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:53,696
For the first time I'm aiming names in specifics

1984
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,256
All began with the corrupt CIA agent

1985
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,304
And to Bohemian official

1986
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,864
Coming today if I'm arrested

1987
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,888
Or disappear

1988
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,960
31 + terabytes of data

1989
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,008
Will be released to the Press

1990
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,056
That was June 2000

1991
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,336
19 South

1992
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,616
There's a big

1993
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,896
Motive

1994
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,016
For him to die

1995
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,808
He's trying to find this

1996
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:23,904
Creep from 8 days ago the rice is queso he find something from 20

1997
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:30,304
Because the 18 days ago was just like I like to the new Rick and Morty episode

1998
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
I mean look

1999
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,144
This is so important to Alex

2000
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
He has to find this

2001
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,984
I'll do it myself cuz it's my fault

2002
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,056
I had it last night shuttle report on last night

2003
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
Today

2004
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
There was a message for Mcafee

2005
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,432
Last week

2006
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,248
And for some reason all the king's horses

2007
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,296
And All the King's Men

2008
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,112
Pull that up so I will find it

2009
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,904
Just go to the garage

2010
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,952
And I will give you

2011
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
That information

2012
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,560
I mean it's his last week

2013
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,352
But did I take a sweater.

2014
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,128
And it's just honest Twitter

2015
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:18,944
My bad

2016
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
Sounds like you're mad

2017
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,832
That's it I'm done today

2018
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,488
Let's go ahead and

2019
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,400
Choir sings about vaccines that's the real

2020
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
Important news for the body

2021
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
What

2022
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,728
What

2023
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,800
Happening

2024
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,592
I don't know the life

2025
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
Is it this

2026
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,152
I'm done

2027
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:55,552
Time it is show this to pay that is like I'm f****** done

2028
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952
I'm getting to the point now where I'm fairly convinced

2029
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:08,352
Text that your Truman showing me like this whole thing is b******* Alex isn't even real and their cameras on

2030
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
Show me all the time because this did not happen

2031
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:14,752
It's this is a lie it's outrageous likes me like I'm done

2032
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:18,336
Twice in the same day is unprecedented

2033
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
And then

2034
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,152
Almost like

2035
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:24,736
A parody of Alex's show for him to be like alright I'm leaving

2036
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:28,576
Play that clip where the gate why are you can't you can't

2037
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:29,856
Like

2038
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:34,976
Apparently it's supposed to be an escalation and you can't parody

2039
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:39,072
I can't I couldn't have thought let's play the game choir sings about back

2040
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:44,960
I can't write that up with that I'm writing a satire

2041
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,008
Situation he won

2042
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Aziza

2043
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,080
He's defeated

2044
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:53,920
So now he's he's transcended Beyond parody

2045
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,064
Only the end of the second hour

2046
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,368
Oh God

2047
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,184
Twice in two hours hours ahead of blow up and threatened

2048
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Believer

2049
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,536
Like okay does the end of the second hour I guess I'm going to go back in

2050
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:13,888
1/3 hours just going to be special reports he's done for the day

2051
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912
He's back

2052
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:27,200
That would be

2053
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,272
I wish I did but it has

2054
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,832
This all before the many hands of team

2055
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
Your belief is not required

2056
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,208
Remaining assets

2057
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,536
Association

2058
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,816
Yeah I regret.

2059
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,864
It's not proof of anything

2060
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,912
No it doesn't say that McAfee wouldn't

2061
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,680
Commit suicide

2062
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
You just saying

2063
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,032
The US thinks he has hidden cryptocurrency not because they want to

2064
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,824
Kill him for it but because he walk

2065
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,920
He was wanted in the United States were Financial crimes related to fraud

2066
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:02,528
Cryptocurrency

2067
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,880
Speed isn't a slam dunk away Alex's pretend

2068
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
This is little

2069
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
Ransom

2070
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,000
Thread to go off air and then convalescent

2071
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
This is again

2072
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,608
Again it's a nut it's a pattern of behavior

2073
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,192
This tweet doesn't match what else is building it up

2074
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
To be right

2075
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,496
He had a lash out

2076
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,800
Almost as a distraction

2077
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
From

2078
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,872
The reality being presented to his audience

2079
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,432
What is narrative doesn't match the supporting Evan

2080
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,480
Happened to Bocce

2081
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
It's basically

2082
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,064
Keep angling it's absolutely

2083
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
And it's just so

2084
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,368
Harmful it's

2085
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,648
So harmful

2086
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
I mean

2087
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,744
How can you

2088
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:47,328
What's you're trapped in that and that works

2089
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
Like

2090
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
What what argument could

2091
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:54,240
Be made like if you want it's like a cooler keys I mean kind of

2092
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:59,872
Didn't send it to a certain extent like if you want to communicate with somebody you have to communicate in their language

2093
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
And if their language

2094
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,712
Is consumed by this

2095
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:07,552
Then the only way you can communicate with them is through this

2096
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,088
You know what I'm saying

2097
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:15,488
Depressing thought conversation with somebody who's willing to just be like

2098
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:20,352
These keys were jangling so I'm going to let whatever information that I was going to talk about go

2099
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,168
I think the humans are susceptible to distraction

2100
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,704
And a lot of times

2101
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,288
Then up we go on autopilot

2102
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
A lot of a Time

2103
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
We don't engage

2104
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
The critical thing

2105
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,408
Skills that we do have

2106
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,432
Access to

2107
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,480
When we feel we don't need

2108
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,040
Right and I think that a lot of the time

2109
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,832
The people who fall for stuff like this

2110
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
Fall into these traps under

2111
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,416
Distracted by these dangling keys

2112
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,952
Or capable

2113
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:49,792
Of thinking their way out of it

2114
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,840
And recognizing oh this is what he

2115
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:54,400
He's doing total I think it is possible

2116
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,448
But generally the stimulus

2117
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,264
That's required to get them to activate those critic

2118
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Thinking

2119
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,312
Tools

2120
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
Are they

2121
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,360
Start ever engaged

2122
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,920
I think it is possible to maybe I'm

2123
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,480
Overly optimistic

2124
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,248
Decor

2125
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,016
Or naive

2126
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,808
But I do believe that that is

2127
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,600
I agree

2128
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,928
Wholehearted and my best evidence for your point

2129
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,232
Is that if it weren't possible

2130
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,256
They wouldn't spend

2131
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:24,096
Billions upon billions of dollars making sure these people

2132
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,888
Never engage with

2133
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:32,288
Constantly Reformation

2134
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,336
What I would argue against your point

2135
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
With

2136
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:41,504
Angle other keys

2137
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:46,368
The only thing that ends up happening is you end up just choosing a different

2138
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,392
Laying of b*******

2139
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,416
Like

2140
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,208
The Alex keys are jangling

2141
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:53,280
And then the qanon keys are jangling over here and

2142
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
You get distracted by those

2143
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,608
You don't really get distract

2144
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
Did towards Reality Bites

2145
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,680
Did that methodology

2146
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,448
I don't think

2147
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
It's unfortunate

2148
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,312
Or at least we haven't figured out a way to distract people with real

2149
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:09,664
Yet I think it's a losing strategy to try it's fine that

2150
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
Don't seem like it's working

2151
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:12,480
So

2152
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,296
For the third hour Alex interviews a guy

2153
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,088
From black guns matter

2154
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:17,856
And

2155
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,136
Okay I don't care

2156
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,952
Okay there interview was

2157
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
I mean the guy

2158
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,304
For the most part there's just a bunch of

2159
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,120
Complaints about guns but then also

2160
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
Talking about

2161
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,680
Black gun ownership in

2162
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,216
Whatever

2163
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Find

2164
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,080
One last thing that we have to take care of those that

2165
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,872
I still don't understand that.

2166
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
Story

2167
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,456
No as a listener of his show

2168
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,736
Going in

2169
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,040
Right information that's provided to me by Alec

2170
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
I don't

2171
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
No

2172
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,624
What the proof is

2173
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,952
The falchi created this pandemic what you're missing

2174
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
Is that the proof is

2175
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,536
He said fauci created the pandemic

2176
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,864
And then we talked about John McAfee dying all the time

2177
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,264
So then you just know that's how she created the pan. Now it's would have gone to it if he had time

2178
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,544
But he was too busy

2179
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,592
Being pissed off about all those clips

2180
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:13,408
He didn't say what it was he

2181
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Okay

2182
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:23,392
Us confirms removal of Wuhan virus sequences

2183
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,184
Database

2184
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Comedy channel

2185
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,120
Questioning bluebird

2186
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,400
Here

2187
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,192
It is yesterday and I hate

2188
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,776
Are sequences that request

2189
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:46,688
Balance read any of the stories about this you would know that it's the policy of the NIH database to consider data to be the property

2190
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
Of the scientist who submitted

2191
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,576
They hold the right to withdraw their data if they want to and that's what happened in this case

2192
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:57,952
Also that dude is still available online and do removal of it from the NIH database will probably have

2193
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,744
Zero impact on any investigation

2194
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,768
The virus

2195
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,840
This is just like a catchy headline I guess the Dozen

2196
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,376
Really is it sounds like it's

2197
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,912
A bigger deal than it is but

2198
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,984
I don't what I've been able to tell this is not

2199
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,776
Necessarily a huge deal

2200
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,800
Speedway

2201
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
If covered by Outlets

2202
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,640
Like New York Times like the story isn't something at

2203
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,920
It's being ignored or

2204
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,712
Or anything it's interesting

2205
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,016
No I mean once it's on the internet

2206
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
It's out there

2207
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,088
You know it's not that you're not happy you can

2208
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:27,392
Can take it off the nih's website but it

2209
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:33,792
They're still f****** way back of it on the nih's website and the story in the New York Times

2210
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,584
About the scientist who used

2211
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,632
Google Cloud 8 a.m. sound

2212
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,424
By all of these old

2213
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
Things that have

2214
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,496
Been taken down

2215
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,824
No sure it's interesting but I don't think it

2216
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
I don't think

2217
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
It proves that

2218
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Fauci

2219
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,664
Created the virus

2220
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,736
So if I understand correctly the researcher

2221
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:55,040
Took down his own

2222
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,832
Research off the NIH website

2223
01:44:57,088 --> 01:45:01,696
He requested to be taken. That proves that fauci created

2224
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,464
Did the virus

2225
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,840
As a listener this show that's the conclusion that I'm black

2226
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,888
The only thing I can think of

2227
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,168
This is dumb

2228
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
Man

2229
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
What an episode

2230
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,848
Beaches

2231
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
F******

2232
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Non-stop bangers

2233
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,248
It was like it was like an early Radiohead show just non

2234
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
Stop it

2235
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,296
All the time

2236
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,088
Damn I got the Bands

2237
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,392
I think

2238
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:33,952
Okay so like most of this episode obviously is

2239
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,232
McAfee nonsense

2240
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
And

2241
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,792
In terms of evidence

2242
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,328
It's presented

2243
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
Still just all those tweets

2244
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
And then

2245
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,288
Mysterious conversation that Alex apparently had on the phone

2246
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:51,872
Definitely happened all of the conversation about that

2247
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:57,504
Are misrepresenting them moving them around in the timeline in order to make things more suspicious

2248
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,808
All of this is just total b*******

2249
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,136
These blowups

2250
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,696
Outrageous he's having a bad day

2251
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,512
It's a real bad thing really pathetic

2252
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,560
It really is like

2253
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,352
When we get past making fun of it

2254
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
It's so sad

2255
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,400
It is

2256
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:21,824
Hey man what are you going to do it's not our fault

2257
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,128
He can't f****** handle is emotional

2258
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:27,200
F****** impulses whatsoever and honestly if

2259
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,760
The conversation that he was having wasn't about how like

2260
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:33,088
The pentagon's at war with white Americans

2261
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:37,440
Look at that wasn't the subject matter that he's discussing it would just be straight-up hilarious

2262
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,608
Incompetent lashes out to such an extreme that when there's a technical difficulty

2263
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:53,568
Dead boarded babies

2264
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,128
And it's so fun to me to be like living in 2000

2265
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,664
Free on his show as well

2266
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,456
Because you get the like

2267
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:05,088
Technical snafus that happened then and he's just like

2268
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,880
Outfit trying to make it in a ton

2269
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:13,280
Descend into these everyone's going to Diane.

2270
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,096
Find a tweet be like an emotional Benjamin Button

2271
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,120
Yeah he's

2272
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,936
Aging backwards

2273
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,704
Intuit child

2274
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
Yeah man

2275
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:27,872
I'm excited to get back to the past cuz I have grown weary of McAfee conspiracies

2276
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,432
Oh yeah but it was a fun little dip

2277
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,248
I will check back in and see how things

2278
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,272
You're going down the line

2279
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,832
I wanted to say one thing really quick without the button

2280
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,112
The button

2281
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
Situation

2282
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,440
People

2283
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,488
Situation

2284
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,560
We're two tone sky

2285
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:51,680
Skinny suspenders about tone situation up

2286
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:54,752
What's the email address to send

2287
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,568
Addresses to is K F business

2288
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,616
Biznes

2289
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
Yes

2290
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,688
At gmail.com

2291
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:07,296
The business right if we will send a request to other inboxes

2292
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,088
Try my best

2293
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,160
Make sure everything gets taken care of but

2294
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:16,512
That centralizing the point where things are futile

2295
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:20,864
The second thing that I wanted to say is this dawned on me when I was thinking about

2296
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,632
It

2297
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:22,912
We're not

2298
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
Building an email list

2299
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:30,848
We're not saving your emails not saving your addresses or anyting I was thinking

2300
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:37,248
About like Rodger Stones weird website where you know I just want to reassure people that like we're not

2301
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
Any information or

2302
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:43,136
Are you not going to be getting any you're getting a button then that's it

2303
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,512
I'm sure that most people listening to the show would never even

2304
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:55,424
I wouldn't suspect it right price but I wanted I wanted to reassure people because

2305
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:01,824
I got worried that someone might suspect that it never even occurred to me

2306
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,152
Despite knowing everyone doing that

2307
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,944
It never occurred to me for a

2308
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:11,296
I started to put myself in the position of being someone who would

2309
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,904
Send up email across my mind maybe

2310
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,208
Is I'm going to end up getting spam or

2311
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,048
I assure you that will not be something that we are

2312
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:27,936
No every time we've done a comedy show and there's been somebody at the door like your email address we send out free tickets

2313
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
It's like

2314
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,472
Oh I f******

2315
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
No you guys

2316
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
See through your lies

2317
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,104
There is a lot of promotional

2318
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:41,248
Reason to gather those hit and we have no interesting

2319
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,552
Made it abundantly clear by now

2320
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,088
We just still

2321
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
