1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,792
Knowledge

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Bestbuy.com

5
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:02,464
What about Nostradamus

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Little bit about

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex Jones

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
We are damn Jordan

9
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
What's up

10
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
Vibrate

11
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,056
Weird but it's very satisfying I don't think I've ever done it before

12
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,152
Wow what a Man Loves a Woman

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,480
So whenever you use the microwave

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
Obviously you don't

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
Two beeps

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
Happened when the timer runs out

17
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
They're annoying

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Yes you want to pull the door before the people

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,096
One second

20
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
But almost every time I open the door any second left on the timer

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
Do the first beat

22
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,408
Today for the first time I've ever noticed I pulled the door at exactly the point where there was no beep

23
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
And the timer with John

24
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
It felt great

25
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
I would I would love

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
To s*** on that as an achievement

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,952
But honestly if I'm alone and I just tossed a piece of paper into a trash can

28
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Fuckingo Apes

29
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
I got you got like boom shakalaka you're on fire

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
Danielle Colby

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
The realreal

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Satisfying tiny moment there

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,944
I'll never I'll never be able to replicate it

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Celebrate they went it happens as opposed to

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,880
Wish we could just leave it as space we always open the microwave door

36
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,232
I think that my bright spot is I

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
I think I've decided to switch back

38
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Contacts

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
Okay my glasses are my visions

40
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
So bad now that at this point

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
I'm like

42
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,008
Leaning into Reed s*** I'm doing the whole thing I got to stop

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,616
With the glasses Dan I got to stop I'm going to go I'm going to go contacts again my friend

44
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Alright

45
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Baby okay

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,296
No

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,672
I look like I'm 19 again I feel like I don't get used to it but

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
It'll be it'll be an adjustment

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
I mean like

50
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Over the course of the pandemic you'd want the headband roof and that was that was tough at first

51
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,544
We got used to it I think I've looked different every five to six months

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
My beard length

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
A bit extra

54
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
And that drastically alter

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
Where's my my appearance

56
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
Yeah I Will Survive. I've never done contact before I forget

57
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Add contacts

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Does that have

59
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
Like do they help more with vision the glasses counter

60
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Not well

61
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
So-so with with my eyes

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
Contacts are very very good for like

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,640
75% of the world you know everything from

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
My full arm away I can see perfectly

65
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Play in all directions

66
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,064
There's this weird Middle Ground between my arm

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
And where I can normally

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
And that's

69
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
That's where I can't see what's on

70
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
So you're saying when you wear contacts

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Sneak up on you and solutely

72
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
ROMs for my lights on

73
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,215
You know there's that it's all there for you I'm I'm essentially a helpless little boy

74
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
As long as you didn't really close

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
This locally penetrate

76
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
As everybody knows

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,175
Sure Thomas Jefferson

78
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
What was my glasses as you can see

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Everything sucks

80
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Hysterical

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Is completely God

82
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,671
So I'm just blind most of the to the periphery

83
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Yeah I got no peripheral vision

84
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Okay easier to sneak up on you then

85
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Which option allows for the best sneak options

86
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
Video games

87
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
We have an episode to go over it's going to be a little bit of an episode

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:14,879
Too much of us too much contact for several hours every

89
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
So today I was just taking a little break

90
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
He's he's gone

91
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
Husband

92
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,519
No stuff to go over I was thinking about like

93
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Impression of Alec

94
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
I'm so boring

95
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:40,991
I was listening to some Harrison Smith stuff and didn't want to do that either

96
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
We had Stewart Roads back on for an interview

97
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
I've not seen that happen

98
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
Since the indictment vs Harrison

99
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Still

100
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Still gung-ho for him

101
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
My free speech

102
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
It's being taken away why

103
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
I mean that's a weird thing considering what was it just yesterday somebody the one of the guys played guilty to seditious conspiracy

104
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Cersei not like

105
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Not anything less than seditious conspiracy

106
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,551
That is top

107
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,623
And there are indications that he's cooperating that's not good

108
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
Yeah yeah

109
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,255
You'll see the treason and you're cooperating

110
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,095
Had a lot going on for you

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
That means that the

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,775
What it what you were looking at is a clout no chance I'm making out with making it out of this trial

113
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
I was at with an acquittal still do public hangings cuz it sounds like that's what they're going for band

114
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
This is cooperative cooperate cooperate

115
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
So we'll see how that all plays out

116
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
But I might not look so great plead guilty

117
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Doesn't look good in retrospect

118
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
Harrison Smith story

119
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:03,679
I'm so excited to do instead of going over some of that stuff which is

120
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Kind of like

121
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Just

122
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Banging

123
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Dark Horse

124
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Banging your head against the wall

125
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
I was I had a mixed metaphor in my head that just wasn't coming out right

126
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
And

127
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
I thought let's go back to the past

128
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Let's do answer

129
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
2003

130
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Continuing that

131
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
Exploration of what the f*** was Alex doing back then

132
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,071
I'm into today we're talking about July 18th 2000

Jordan

148
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
This is a bottle episode essentially I mean like

149
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
In 2003 alot of these have

150
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Very little connection to

151
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
Anything that's going on certainly the present-day or even around them cuz I mean like our last episode from 2003

152
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
Alex talk to that Wizkid who couldn't get her diploma cuz she wasn't old enough to

153
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
To get equivalent to high school

154
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,879
Dr. David race Bannon from Interpol

155
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
You have all that

156
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
Has nothing to do with it

157
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
It's always fun

158
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
Getting just a slight bit of distance away

159
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,471
Being being with my memory that I have and then you tell me all of these things and I know they happen at the same time

160
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
My brain is like

161
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
There's no way those things happen

162
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
Korea being Assassin's Creed triple

163
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
I remember that happening

164
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
A fictional character obviously

165
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Yeah the highlights of

166
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,719
Something is going on on this show in the past

167
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
The path

168
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:41,887
Call mireille connective tissue pieces is collars

169
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
Congratulating Alex on his Ann Coulter interview

170
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,847
That seems to be one of the only things that actually goes through all these episodes and makes me feel like

171
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,455
Yeah this definitely did happen the day after the last one that's true

172
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
Weird

173
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Today's episode

174
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Rhode Island

Obvious vampire vampire Mister blood

177
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Alex

178
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
Don't get into business with mr. blood

179
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
He's from the Northeast cuz I'm sorry that one that one trick

Man veritiv saw that are going throughout this episode

183
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
One of them is

184
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
Outrageously offended okay

185
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
It is

186
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,007
Very much Alex taking a new story

187
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
And repurposing it for his own use

188
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
As a homophobic

189
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Attack

190
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,711
Good

191
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Depravity

192
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Reporting

193
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Literally

194
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
Doughboy

195
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
A little shocking like

196
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,151
Very clearly aa8 just a child

197
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,479
With no information letting his imagination run wild like

198
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Oh yeah yeah gay people I don't understand

199
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
This is before eating

200
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,631
It's true

201
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
This

202
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
Situation where there are like a couple of data points that Alex's

203
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
What you're saying like a child just connecting things

204
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Just like I don't know what Rolling Stone article Alex exciting if it's

205
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
Any of that nonsense I'd really like to get a look at

206
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Pacific time

207
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
I don't know

208
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Scriptures

209
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
Literally just say that end with this such a blase like

210
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
You know this is just

211
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
What is it with these kids these days

212
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:34,079
Very popular among the gay community to each other and give each other AIDS

213
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
This is going to be something

214
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,063
It keeps coming up on this episode so we'll deal with it a little

215
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
More details later but

216
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
This is just homophobic nonsense freely and the guy Alex is talking about he didn't get arrested for saying gay

217
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
He was arrested related to

218
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
Some things that he said at a fair that were alleged to have been inciting

219
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,799
This dude gave a speech where he asserted that he believed the country people should have the same rights as members of minority groups

220
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
That's the version of the story has a

221
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Appears in papers

222
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Speed wasn't recorded at according to

223
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
BBC quote

224
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Several people

225
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Complain to the police about his speech

226
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
What kind of assumed that he said some other s***

227
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,023
This created a fake version of the story

228
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,631
The scientific term for whatever as everybody's known for a long time

229
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
The Spanish word for black is the scientific term used to describe human

230
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,151
Is Robin something

231
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
We we talked we talked about this

232
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
In detail on past episodes

233
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
He gave people forgot

234
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
So this is an interesting point to that should be remembered I think is illustrated by this clip even as far back as 2003

235
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Alex was spreading

236
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,607
Legally insane and bigoted narratives about gay people like to be cannibals and give each other AIDS

237
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
So when someone suggests that he always

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
We are we wasn't always such a bigot

239
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
It's just not borne out by the reality

240
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
Pretty pretty nuts

241
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
But you know it when you can

242
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
When you can look at somebody's bigotry

243
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
As as like

244
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
Somebody somewhere somehow describing you know Alex wasn't his bigoted back then

245
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Is he is now

246
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,975
And you're only thing you can hang your hat on right now I guess

247
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,327
She's like now his bigotry is full out like maybe we should just kill everybody I don't lie

248
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
But back then it was like

249
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Everybody I don't like

250
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Is probably a cannibal

251
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
Which is almost kind of a hero like that is big agree

252
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
That's true

253
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
It's true there is a like

254
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
Psych meds turn you into

255
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,039
Hers or something through the quality of

256
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
I think that I

257
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
I disagree with Alex's coverage here bro

258
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
Keeps me pretty insistent about

259
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Can you run out of

260
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Flash

261
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,815
Weird tell me more about

262
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
I knew immediately what Alex was talking about here but the way he is reporting on this is just cartoonish

263
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
Spanish in the US to go to Mexico to get your legs cut off so you can eat them when you run out of Lake

264
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
Kill you in order for you to be

265
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
So this is based on just

266
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
The few stories that have come out of people who want to have their healthy limbs amputated sure there's a pretty poorly understood phenomenon

267
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
That's been labeled body Integrity identity

268
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Adidas order and cases

269
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Pretty low but it's

270
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
It's very difficult to get a precise number

271
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
Hannah people who experiences

272
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,495
It's definitely not always connected to sexual feelings of those sometimes people do

273
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
I have a sexual relationship with

274
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,639
I am feeling faint wanting to get their limbs amputated so they can

275
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
That's not typically the presentation

276
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Alex is writing a grotesque

277
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Story about something that he knows nothing about it

278
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Uno's

279
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
But it's not in this financial interest to know anything

280
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
Think about if he learns things but he can't do these cannibals Walk Among Us Marantz to scare the audience so they can pick the game

281
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Gay people should be seen as less than human

282
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
A big

283
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Fetish to go to bed

284
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Cookout

285
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,215
You know you'll get off

286
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Double Chestnut

287
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Okay

288
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Alright

289
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
So

290
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
It look okay

291
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
You can you can sell you can tell me like there's this fetish for going and getting your legs chopped off in

292
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
So people can eat

293
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
He didn't tell you that

294
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
My problem

295
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Really

296
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Is the follow-up

297
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Where he's like

298
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
And they say I'm crazy

299
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
You are actually I think that by the end of episode I will lay out what

300
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
I believe that strategy

301
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,663
Cuz I do think that's an intentional strategy extreme criticizing

302
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Abs

303
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
On our way to finding this

304
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
Conclusion we need to learn more about this

305
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,951
There's some more cannibalism to be discussed a demographic

306
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Breakdown we have

307
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,375
Isaac Moore large people with larger legs who are chopping their legs off

308
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
And I'm going to like crack

309
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
You know I'm going to gain some weight before I go down there

310
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:55,615
Substantial to really chew on you know but that might actually not be how you get the best

311
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,431
That's a good point

312
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,247
I don't I don't know no there is no discussion of this

313
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,831
But it turns out that there is a case

314
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Ava cannibal 2003

315
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Hannibal

316
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Charged with murder

317
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Manscape

318
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
I'm coming in

319
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
Spell lackadaisical throw to a mammoth clone a story about a third of all men in San Francisco 1

320
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
I get AIDS and die and I guess mammoths around next time news I didn't track that down

321
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,807
But I don't know what he's talking about and I don't notice Rolling Stone article is

322
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Accountable this is Armin Muse

323
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Suicide German dude who ate a guy who'd volunteer to do it after meeting Armon on a message board called the cannibal Cafe

324
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,423
There may have been like 450 people on that message board like Alex think it's a group of 450 right

325
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,287
But I'm going to guess that a vast majority of them were just people at a vorarephilia can't

326
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Which is the erotic desire to eat some on orbi

327
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
Like the Cannibal Cop from years ago

328
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
But not a not quite but everyone on that message board was on there to roll place

329
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Something

330
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
But not something they actually wanted to do which is

331
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Probably a big part of why our men had multiple people agreed to let him eat them but then they ultimately backed out

332
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
I would guess that that was because they realize he was serious about eating them which was a deal-breaker

333
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
No

334
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
They wanted to jerk off to the thought

335
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Not actually

336
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
Probably

337
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
Initially this was a mess from a court perspective because as the BBC put it quote

338
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Cannibalism is not a recognized defense under German law and the defense will argue that since the victim volunteered this was

339
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Was no murder

340
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
That's trouble

341
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,536
A bad day in court for everyone involved

342
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,424
Oh s*** we forgot to make this illegal

343
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
So in his first trial he was convicted of manslaughter but he was retried in 2005 where the argument that

344
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
He was killing for sexual gratification

345
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
The Proven by the fact that he had videotaped the crime

346
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Led to a murder can

347
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,600
It probably didn't help that he had also posted on that message board looking for another person

348
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Which really made the case pretty strong that he was like

349
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
Syria leader

350
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah now you're serial cannibal killer

351
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
Exceedingly uncommon crime for someone to commit

352
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Evidenced by the fact

353
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Tire world knows exactly this is the same case where they cut off the penis and they

354
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Sensational headline grabbing community

355
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Important place

356
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Puppies to recognize

357
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,232
In 2003 trans people weren't the primary target of the extreme right in terms of their desire to kick up

358
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,512
Fake moral panics

359
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,608
This isn't to say that homophobia doesn't exist anymore in our present-day but

360
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,728
It's not as Central to the right-wing strategy anymore because it doesn't create the same response In Their audience

361
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,056
People are cooler with gay people now so they got to get more extreme

362
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,640
They have to wait to further their referrals on there exactly

363
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
The homosexual community

364
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,296
It's not as vulnerable as they were to their attacks

365
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
As they were e2003

366
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,744
You got it be above all the stuff that the more mainstream right-wing pundits get into but

367
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,304
He's no different than any of them he's just ignoring

368
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,936
Extreme version he's willing to make more stuff up to keep his audience interested but he plays the exact same game

369
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
That

370
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,288
His contemporaries like a rusher and

371
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
What do

372
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah and it's

373
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,920
It's so it's so emblematic of who they are as people

374
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,456
Like deep down

375
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
That

376
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
The moments a

377
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
Minority group

378
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Become strong enough

379
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,880
And received enough support

380
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
They stopped

381
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,512
Attacking it on whatever ideological quote-unquote grounds or moral grounds bad before

382
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
And the go to somebody weaker

383
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
Weaker always weaker group that has less

384
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
Societal support

385
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
More vulnerability

386
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Particularly distasteful about it is

387
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Then they'll pretend that like

388
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
I never really had a problem with that problem with gay people what they do inside their bedrooms I'm fine with whatever

389
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,672
Are you do at home now I should tell you they like you like to eat people

390
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
Yeah it's just such a like

391
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,400
How do how does everybody not look at them and they're just a bunch of cowardly bullies and we get

392
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Trapped by them

393
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Cuz they're so f****** loud all the

394
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
You know

395
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
It's it's brutal

396
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
Yeah

397
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah

398
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,896
I think that one of the values of going back and looking

399
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Episode

400
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,504
That the cultural milieu of the right-wing

401
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,344
And they're the sort of culture War narratives

402
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,624
Are so

403
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
Similarly

404
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,768
Strategized but their focus is are different

405
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Can see soak

406
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Clearly how that works

407
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
By comparing

408
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
Verizon

409
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
No and they just keep going down the list of letters in lgbtq has just like oh well today we're going to pick on G

410
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,312
Tomorrow we're going to pick auntie

411
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
It's just a monster

412
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Stop

413
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
Alex Goes to call

414
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
A lot of calls at this episode cuz he burned himself out on guest

415
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,064
Dr. race Bannon I believe you're not going to get much better than that

416
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
You can't

417
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Is a hero

418
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,232
Xor this caller has a great question for Alex and this

419
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
You can tell Alex was a little bit pissed off by this

420
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
I miss the bright

421
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,352
New York calling

422
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Fallout

Come on

424
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Anybody

Fallout

426
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
Hearing call yourself you can call him

427
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,024
Thank you so much

428
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
I love that this show could have those moments right now

429
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,568
F*** all those theater and is this guy the best vidock you better give me a compilation of other colors being like

430
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Is Brian from New York okay we haven't heard from him in a while get into a fight you guys doing okay I love the moment of Alex

431
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
Responding yeah me and the scholar got into a fight

432
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
What what what what

433
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:07,744
What what's that kind of like yeah that's what happened like

434
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,560
That kind of rhetorical

435
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:16,704
Doesn't exist for a there's no good so sarcastic shitbag comebacks

436
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Then to the something refreshing about that

437
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,360
So there's also a collar with a conversation about nuclear

438
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Attack

439
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Or maybe a false flag nuclear attack

440
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
It's coming

441
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,504
And Alex has some interesting advice about

442
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
The winners get your guard up and cry

443
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Pearl Harbor

444
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
The may be too risky for them do it

445
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
ReliOn missile sailor

446
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Significantly

447
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,216
Talk about North Korea

448
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
What I probably out

449
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
They probably already got the Warhead

450
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,784
Play the here in this country

451
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Only one take

452
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
Chance on losing their own people they have to happen

453
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,816
Complaining

454
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,472
At 1 meeting

455
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,640
Look out whenever the globalists are out of town in let's go

456
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Yeah

457
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,760
You ever do those shows that like vfw's

458
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,552
No

459
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,904
Never done an Elks Lodge or anything like that a bee but the longtime

460
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,304
I don't remember all of the gigs I did

461
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
More than my fair share

462
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,936
Karaoke at VFW Halls Florida

463
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
I've done plenty and there is that like

464
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
It's all going fine before the show

465
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,104
You do the show and if everybody likes you

466
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
You get asked

467
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,944
To join conversations that sound absurdly like this one

468
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,344
All the time of just like well you know obviously they the evil Boogeyman wouldn't do this they would hide the new

469
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,184
Inside your bedroom for whatever

470
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,584
And then when they go out to the grocery store that delivers

471
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
Yeah yeah

472
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,680
This is a false flag that didn't happen

473
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
Another bad prediction on Alex's Park

474
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
But I do like there's a there's a distinct

475
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:34,432
Difference here between the way Alex talks about what the other globalist evil plan

476
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,016
Compared to the present day

477
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,320
They are going to kill all of their over money

478
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,464
Everybody's you don't have to worry about the globalist going out of town anymore. World in the present

479
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,328
Like that's not going to help you know not whether or not there's a

480
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
So we got another bad prediction Alex's bar

481
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
Don't work

482
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,648
So we have two predictions here just from the beginning of this episode

483
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
That

484
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Not good

485
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
One another National Drive

486
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Did not happen

487
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
Nuclear attack from North Korea

488
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,680
Or possibly a false flag made to look like North Korea I was sleeping

489
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
Baboon pasta Club listed

490
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,336
Just just as a reminder of the

491
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,920
No he's always quitting me of things that Alex's wrong about predicting

492
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
You are the problem was you would just going out of town when the

493
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
North Koreans nuked

494
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
You are out of Chicago we got nuked

495
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,792
Back together pretty quick to get the win

496
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,376
Community solidarity, 2 gal rebuild and time

497
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,984
Got to get this together before.

498
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,312
Oh no your gossip dad that's what everybody said

499
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
So

500
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,640
We heard from the out-of-context drop

501
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Mister blood

502
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,992
Is now syndicated

503
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Yay

504
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,136
Alex gets a call from somebody who is

505
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:27,584
Maybe from the same station or another station in Rhode Island I'm not sure Alex may have to

506
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Stations in

507
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:36,288
I'm actually think I know what is the issue is here I think I think I know what the deal is

508
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,616
Is he does mention that there's like two stations in Rhode Island

509
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
So this person is calling from one of them

510
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Didn't talk to you about my name is Michelle

511
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Freeman in my head

512
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Then Freeman and he's on

513
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
I got to let you know

514
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Is warl power

515
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
1820 and

516
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
Reality radio

517
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
And the Wild

518
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Providence

519
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Houston

520
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
It's based in Providence

521
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
There's nothing there wattage

522
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
So they have

523
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,576
Did they

524
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
More listeners

525
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
Look this this lady giving her first and last name is the beginning of something that ends up paying off late

526
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
There's another caller the next caller gives his first and last name

527
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,056
Universal last name for somebody could be calling in to make somebody else look bad

528
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,080
Got to cut it out

529
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:50,528
So it should come as no surprise here Jordan know that this radio station doesn't exist in the same format that it didn't 2000

530
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:56,160
That whole reality radio thing that I was just so excited about

531
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:02,560
1320 am in that area of the Northeast is actually based out of Attleboro Massachusetts

532
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Santa's been operational

533
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Since 1950

534
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,448
Going through many changes in their theme from that time

535
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
Previous rebranding as reality radio it has been following

536
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Easy listening format

537
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
So there was another AM station in Providence around that time Wale 990 that was

538
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
A lot of conspiracy

539
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,856
I think that's the other station that Alex is talking about being on

540
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
They went bankrupt

541
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,744
In 2003 programming was shifted over 230

542
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
1820 and they sold their name to Wally

543
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,984
So it should be noted that he known as insignificant part of this station going bankrupt had to do with America's really f*****

544
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Top shows

545
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:47,104
American dissident voices which was released by the National Alliance

546
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
Who are Nazi

547
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,760
In Rhode Island

548
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
So cropped

549
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,880
1320 switch formats over to adult

550
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
Conspiracy lineup took some of their programming on

551
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
And it was not a hitch because

552
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,608
By 2004 they switched again and we're now a Sports Talk Show

553
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:13,472
They were running Lako Nova gone for a long time

554
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
Are the matter all about these

555
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
And the women are not things

556
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
And the children are really f****** Nazis bad

557
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
I was I was

558
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
I think

559
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
Some Killers amass enough

560
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Yeah

561
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
I watched

562
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
I didn't realize they had videos of like live performance

563
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Oh my God

564
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Number one

565
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,656
I forgot that the news from Lake Wobegon was

566
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Such a long

567
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Segment

568
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,104
I didn't realize and some of them were like 20 minutes forever was just like a little

569
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,456
A little thing would you remember the show in your head it is

570
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
Encapsulated by like five sentences every show and then if you actually go back and listen to it you're like this is in terminal

571
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
It's never end I thought I thought my memory dealers show was the

572
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Variety show

573
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
Segment to the news from Lake Wobegon commercial

574
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
So I got bored

575
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Also watching

576
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,384
Garrison Keillor deliver this was something that

577
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,712
I don't know maybe it's just cuz I grew up in this like a

578
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
Dr kind of family there was this impression of him is like one of the great orators and storytellers

579
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,208
In the legacy of Mark Twain Diner

580
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,048
Lackadaisically like Spirit like looking down at the ground and

581
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,400
Kicking non-existent rocks on stage

582
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
It was

583
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,240
Awful he has got a face for radio my friend

584
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,800
Did you see the way the movie

585
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,848
No oh man I think

586
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,456
I may be misremembering this entirely but I'm fairly certain Lindsay Lohan was in there

587
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,784
Oh yeah yeah I don't want to say what

588
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
Yeah

589
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
Don't stop excited I was shocked

590
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
Watching it how

591
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,048
Adjust on a compelling of a performance it was

592
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:20,448
It made me reconsider a lot of things that my parents thought were entertaining when I was younger

593
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
Yeah well it'll do it

594
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:28,640
Just make sure I never have to watch a video of a live taping of what do you know

595
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,248
Yeah please do that would be trouble we do not recommend

596
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
Although I have found

597
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
Old

598
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
Recordings of Celtic connections

599
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
And

600
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
Hearts of Space

601
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Never heard of hearts

602
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Subspace

603
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
The space

604
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,328
Space was a show that would play on like

605
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,424
I think it was Saturday or Sunday nights on NPR

606
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
And it was space music

607
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
So it was like

608
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
Soundscapes

609
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,360
Okay but then they were beat like the narrator of it

610
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Haha I will be like

611
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,552
Hearts of Space fellow-traveller

612
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Welcome

613
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
You're welcome fellow space straight up like a quiet storm like

614
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,280
Meadows SNL characters

615
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,352
I don't I don't know that sketch your talk about

616
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
Each episode of cyber call would have like

617
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,752
A theme that were just these abstract themes like to

618
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Today today words

619
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Dealing with Envy

620
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,760
Mariah Carey's first album was dropped

621
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
I could have been could have been

622
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,624
I don't know I still really enjoy Hearts of Space though that's

623
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,208
That is a lot of fun

624
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Anyway

625
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,120
Alex is on the station and that it went off the air within a year

626
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay Sports Talk format

627
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
That's not bad

628
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
So Alex gets another caller

629
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
This guy

630
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,408
Is just a nice pretty clearly Sovereign citizen fella

631
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
The government

632
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
As far as

633
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Issues

634
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
Security number

635
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Revoked

636
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Driver's license

637
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
It all that

638
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Lake County Jail

639
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
And they said in the court

640
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
Punishment

641
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Ordinary

642
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:24,864
Ordinarily

643
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,984
Court

644
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
They didn't actually get to this Denver case accidentally in a little

645
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
Little bit but I think I think you can do a lot of hiding out by calling yourself a constitutional

646
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
List of Saturday's Auburn citizen

647
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,584
Weird Al which is what this guy's doing

648
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
My hands on whatever he went

649
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,520
Because I'm sure it's not what he's saying

650
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,408
Something to do with the constitution in his love of it a copy of

651
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
The Constitution and 16 secret police members just

652
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,064
Descended upon him and they had to throw him in jail

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
So the same color has some other ideas I think he's kind of atone for Malik

654
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
Just bouncing it back at him

655
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
You know I was looking at Birth

656
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
Minister of England

657
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
Gay guys

658
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
Let me know what's up with that

659
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,848
Each other

660
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
I'm sorry for

661
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
The shacknews

662
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Thanks a lot

663
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Family Auto

664
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
Joe

665
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,184
You know

666
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
It is

667
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,512
A sad day

668
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Every time

669
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,840
I hear

670
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
A conservative

671
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
Laugh just because some guy went

672
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
Those two men standing close to each other

673
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,568
What if they were banging right hahaha

674
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Oh my God that's

675
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,640
The funniest thing I've ever considered

676
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,320
It's it's an expression of some homophobia but it is also at the same time just not a

677
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Good joke

678
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,160
It's just a bad joke yeah it's kind of

679
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Clever and pack

680
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
Even if it weren't

681
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
Offensive it's just

682
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
That's just sad

683
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
So I told you they were two narratives it was sort of running through the episode the first is gay people like to eat

684
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
Human

685
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,848
That's not a bad

686
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
I think Alex is reporting it is about

687
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
Alright so

688
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,832
The second story is about David Kelley who was a not today that TV producer

689
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
Abby

690
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,160
He was a weapons inspector

691
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
And

692
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
Doctor

693
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,536
Who committed suicide

694
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,864
And died the day before this episode

695
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
And

696
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
Story of it has to do

697
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:09,984
With

698
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,080
He had been quoted in an article in the BBC

699
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
I've been had to do with

700
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,688
A claim that was in British

701
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,272
Government dossier about the Iraq War in there

702
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,040
Potential for weapon

703
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
The best destruction

704
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
There's a line in it about there being

705
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
RV

706
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
The weapons could be deployed within 45 min

707
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
Okay this line itself

708
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
I asked

709
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Aladdin

710
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
By David Kelly

711
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,936
Was something that the Downing Street

712
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
Spokesperson insisted be put in

713
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
The report

714
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
And so there was a big

715
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
Brouhaha about this

716
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,456
And the characterization of it

717
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,016
And the BBC weather it matched

718
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,088
What David Kelly had told this reporter

719
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,648
Weather was supposed to be entirely on background

720
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:06,048
And it's it's just a huge mess right and this he ended up dying from suicide

721
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Prior to that

722
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,400
The episode narrative I didn't

723
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,984
Spend a lot of time I didn't want to cut at an eclipse cuz it's kind of grotesque

724
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
In some ways yeah

725
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,592
But Alex is just insisting that the government killed him off

726
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
Because he

727
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,920
He was blowing the whistle

728
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,248
Alex exaggerate the actions and the circle

729
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
Dances around it

730
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
I'm just going to play this one clip

731
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Because I think

732
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
18

733
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Jordan to recognize

734
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
How Alex

735
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Takes

736
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,256
Add absence of information and now he has

737
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
He has no idea what happened

738
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
This guy

739
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:46,496
Was announced dead hours before this show so he knows all the details he needs to

740
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
He just

741
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,151
Declares it essentially a cover up a murder

742
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
Friday because

743
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
More interesting for him

744
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
Moron

745
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
What is the point

746
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,671
Of saying it'll never come out how he died or maybe it will who knows

747
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,999
What is the point of that except to inject

748
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,303
On healthy distrust

749
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Like just

750
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Sleep need jerk

751
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
Based on nothing distrust

752
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,239
An Indian expectation of

753
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Everything is a lie

754
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
And I think that's

755
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Knox help

756
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,871
Yeah I mean

757
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
He's just saying

758
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Look Anything Could Happen

759
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
But whatever it is they tell you is

760
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
We heard him say as it relates to the invasion of Ukraine

761
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
Never know the actual death numbers don't never tell you the truth

762
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:21,727
They're lying to you and if what they're lying to is what's truth or lying to about what's true to lie to you about it

763
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,847
It's a it's an attempt to insulate all information sources

764
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,895
Outside of

765
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,687
The audience's acceptance

766
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
Trust no one but me

767
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
Alex

768
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
Call from another guy

769
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
He's got himself a little militia going

770
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
Your opinion and

771
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
I need one

772
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Muon

773
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Information

774
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
A couple of days

775
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Family

776
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
2002.

777
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Are you familiar with

778
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Rick Stanley

779
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Future

780
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Melissa

781
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
Did you know he's issued up

782
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
Don't we

783
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Obligation

784
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Black magic

785
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
Just a white dude

786
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Denver

787
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,703
So this is the Denver case that Alex was referencing earlier

788
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:02,079
Which is weird because he was referencing it sort of abstractly and then this caller calls in

789
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,199
Not in response to Alex's, it brings up the guy that that case was about

790
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
Knots

791
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
This guy's website is Stanley 2002. Org because he's running for Senate in Colorado is a libertarian

792
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
At this point or dead

793
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
Spoiler like he didn't do too well

794
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,279
He did somehow get 111 vote

795
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,327
Which is way more than I would have expected

796
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
I bet it was all from quote

797
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
Like-minded

798
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Could be

799
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,263
Part of why I am shocked you got this many votes is cuz he's clearly an insane person

800
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
Based on this collar and Alex

801
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335
What's the description of input also

802
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
Because he got in the

803
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
Trouble prior to the election due to some bad behavior in an online discussion about immigration

804
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:47,903
There was apparently so offensive that is over it commented to the Rocky Mountains

805
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,719
Quote Michelle is a very emotional woman

806
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:54,303
Surprise surprise and politics there might be emotional women

807
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:00,191
Seems like an a******

808
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:05,055
Just wow you know just those guys so in this discussion about immigration

809
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,687
For some reason Stanley decided to post a really offensive racist poem titled illegal

810
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,295
I can't find the full text to it but here's the part that's quoted in the Rocky Mountain news

811
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
Quote welfare check

812
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,391
Wealthy

813
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
Medicaid that keeps you healthy

814
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
By-and-by I got plenty

815
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
Thanks to you American dummy

816
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,607
Doesn't really rhyme necessarily but that's beginning of it

817
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
And apparently here's the last line

818
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
From the poem

819
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Quote

820
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:37,567
We think America darn good place to darn good for the white man race

821
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,871
If they know like us they can go

822
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,431
Got lots of room in Mexico

823
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
You know

824
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,343
Racist poetry has really Fallen since a White Man's Burden

825
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,439
You know like at least a White Man's Burden had a structure to it

826
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:58,303
This action did not sit well with folks

827
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
The idea of

828
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
Contributing This Racist poem to an online discussion about it

829
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
He's a few hundred years late that being a great poem

830
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Little bit of Akita

831
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,639
He proved that in the local press

832
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Maybe he went from

833
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,967
115 V 211

834
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Correct

835
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:20,575
The event that Alex in this dollar talking about isn't quite what they're making it out to be

836
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,695
Got arrested for open carrying a 357 at a campaign event

837
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,743
Which is illegal in the town that he was in

838
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,351
That would be one thing and a situation that happened

839
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,655
Do you wait and see if you get the law changed

840
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
He's a real weirdos

841
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
Took a different route

842
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,847
He was set to start his 90-day sentence in jail did he got for this open carry violation

843
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:50,015
You didn't show up

844
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:56,415
That if they didn't overturn the verdict in this case is mutual militia would arrest them

845
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Treason

846
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
Each of them notices

847
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,559
Guess what this is way more illegal than

848
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
From Carrie

849
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Active orders

850
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
Against him to ensure the safety of the judge

851
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Orders which Stanley was explicit

852
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
If he did not accept as real

853
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
This led to getting SWAT team

854
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,663
I have to protect the judges from the Potential Threat of this guy

855
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,943
Malicious

856
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,015
It's that he clearly believes are above the law

857
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:28,671
He was sentenced to six years in jail after the sentencing he was quoted as saying the only victim here is

858
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,023
Stanley America

859
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Final words are going to be like what did I do

860
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,727
So that this guy that's who they're talking about

861
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,335
I'm going crazy it's one of these kinds of people there

862
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Clearly

863
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
F*****-up Behavior right

864
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,759
Gets reinterpreted and repackaged on Alex's show as like yeah you know what he was just going

865
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
To be a symbolic protest where he brought a gun to the courthouse

866
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,303
He just wanted to know what was going on and then the FBI was like you can't use the Constitution

867
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,655
He was like I'm going to kill these judges and I don't even know why people got mad

868
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,727
You know what was the problem in the first place he was just

869
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:18,847
Open carrying a 357 Magnum Magnum at a f****** political rally

870
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:24,479
Black people who are doing good things do I honestly think that you know based on

871
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:31,135
Whatever I don't think him having the gun at his rally is necessarily the big

872
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
That's why he only would have gotten 90 days in jail

873
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
4 +

874
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
Be the kind of wedge issue that Alex

875
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Wants to protest today

876
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,631
Him having the gun the rally

877
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,215
Could be the case that you use as a something

878
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
Initiate a larger discussion about it

879
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:53,407
The 90-day sentence

880
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:58,783
Way out of proportion you go 90 days they might as well be killing my child you know and then

881
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,855
The Second Amendment got about you do all that

882
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
Forget the part where is the retina

883
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
Judges

884
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
Yeah but the threatening judges part where you go to jail for six years and that one's going to really hurt the other

885
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
One of the parts that made the threats to the judges

886
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
More

887
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Problematic

888
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
Is that it was

889
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Clearly

890
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,799
You have to overturn my sentence or there's Wisconsin

891
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Clearview intentions clear

892
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Like that he was

893
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,991
Saying that he had the backing of this militia

894
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,319
Goodbye made the threat

895
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
Little bit more

896
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,623
Difficult for him

897
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,511
Not get in trouble for ideologically Libertarians are okay with extortion

898
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Twitter guns

899
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
At your head

900
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,167
So Alex gets another caller

901
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,727
Man there's a lot of weirdos we're getting play

902
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Shoutouts on this episode

903

Transition a peaceful order

909
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
Transition back

910
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
You never hear about him hear about it

911
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Turn all those guys

912
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
Distract

913
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,263
I tried agree it probably was

914
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Ratify

915
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
However

916
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
What you don't need to go that route

917
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
Gary 8 tomorrow

918
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
And they've got him in prison

919
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
In Mississippi even though the 1st

920
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Addiction was not

921
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
Executed

922
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
Because you got a jury trial

923
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Call bakery

924
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Oh my God

925
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,791
So this really exciting

926
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,327
Another person has a

927
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:52,959
Violence free plan on how to revert the government back to a law of the land situation

928
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:57,311
I guess probably has to be in Sovereign citizen

929
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,871
No taxes being illegal in Egypt

930
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,527
Garry's Mod got arrested for filing fraudulent tax returns and helping other people file fraudulent extra

931
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
The larger picture of his career is that he's another really scary militia demagogue that tried to take over a county and Ida

932
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,583
In 1996 he was the head of a group called The Idaho sovereignty Association which is

933
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Naturally

934
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,119
Sovereign

935
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
Apparently part of his belief system is that your constitutional rights are actually your property in a literal sense

936
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,847
And each of them is worth $100,000

937
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
If you deprive someone of a right

938
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
You owe them $100

939
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
Alright

940
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Well

941
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
I like this

942
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,111
Sure I do I do

943
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,207
I'm starting to like this idea so you could sell your write them to like

944
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,047
You know you can sell your third on Spotify all things

945
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,143
Then soldiers fetish for cutting off my own leg

946
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,447
I'm going to sell you my rights to keep

947
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
Soldiers

948
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:02,079
Khuda bhi of who could force you to put them up for $100,000

949
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
I think that's mine

950
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,919
I'll take that into effect

951
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,759
Because there was a woman in the area whose husband had died and she had all

952
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,671
Ada County had assigned a guardian to take care of her which demott claimed as a violation of This Woman's

953
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Due process rights

954
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,023
I have no idea

955
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,863
He was connected to this woman and it's entirely possible he had no connection to her at all

956
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Just founder

957
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,543
I have no idea what was really mad about this so he gave notice that he and his group plan to arrest the judge

958
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Patricia Fleming

959
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
But this wasn't all

960
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,503
He is also demanding that every other official needed to retake their Oaths of office with the words so help me

961
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Me God added

962
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,855
They would risk being arrested by his militia

963
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,927
Who's important these words be added because demott thinks

964
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:52,767
That not having so help me God in there is a loophole

965
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,631
That allows these officials to commit perjury Saturday Saleeby in perjury

966
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,215
So from an article in the Associated Press from 1996

967
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,823
Those who receive notices will have 10 days to take a new oath of office

968
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:10,175
On September 28th town criers will read the names of those who have not

969
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
Complied with the staffs

970
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,039
From every County Courthouse in Idaho

971
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,599
I honestly it like

972
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,391
There's no way to solve

973
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
This problem for good

974
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
Except I have a thought

975
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
How about we gather all of these people

976
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,559
Alright

977
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,143
And if you're a militia person who does stuff like this

978
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,031
You just get put under a giant Dome you go to sleep all the sudden you wake up here in a giant Dome real lost

979
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,567
Scenario

980
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,359
Nobody knows what's going on

981
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
But you're not in jail

982
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
That's better

983
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,783
Write go live in your little Utopia where you can be all like all were in the old west

984
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,831
Put them under a dome I do think

985
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
I think a Truman Show of

986
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,927
Like it's the only way

987
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
What is thinks it'll be interesting if you did that almost feels like a social experiment is that these people would not get along

988
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
It'll be dead in short

989
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:09,055
It would be a great like why not

990
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:15,199
Sovereign citizen Island like why can't we have nice things like we had the idea for grifter Island

991
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,223
Exactly one point

992
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,343
Island isolated from the rest of humanity

993
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,647
That's really the issue that we're dealing with

994
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
They shouldn't be harmed

995
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
Because we're just people trying to go about the

996
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,559
Their date but they also can interact with the rest of society cuz they're going to kill people

997
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
Black kill people just

998
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
Waste

999
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:40,031
Everyone's time

1000
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,383
Put out this order that I had to retake their Oaths of office or they are going to get in trouble

1001
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,967
And then from there to my plan to arrest all the officials who did

1002
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
Retake the routes

1003
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
Ann's Justice Lana

1004
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
She was going down

1005
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
He was going to do this with the help of sheriff's deputy

1006
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
These Bots

1007
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:59,743
If they didn't go along with the plan and hot said he was going to arrest the sheriff

1008
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,303
He's already getting the b b b

1009
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
My marching orders only come by

1010
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:11,263
Not by any established Authority

1011
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,103
Call the Lansing

1012
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,223
Anyway this guy's attacks protester Sovereign citizen proponent to Triad do

1013
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
Take over County in Idaho in the mid-90s

1014
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
What a old school

1015
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:31,999
The time you know School weirdos episode

1016
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:38,399
For cannibalism Sovereign citizens have a fetish for overthrowing elected local government

1017
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
Balloon afraid of threats

1018
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Exactly

1019
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,567
Yeah everybody knows this is just another one of those things

1020
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:51,967
So if Alex is complaining about Patriots shows other Patriot shows another like

1021
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
Knitting circles for Patriot

1022
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
I just like the drama

1023
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
But

1024
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
I would say that at the end of this clip Alex

1025
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
Gives a piece of advice that he himself should have taken

1026
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
AR

1027
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,399
Bicycle song

1028
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
Poor people

1029
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
In one particular

1030
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Leverage

1031
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
What's going on

1032
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
Violent

1033
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
White marker

1034
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
Oh

1035
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,679
They use things to backfire on us not we are a bunch of idiots who have bad

1036
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,799
That idea is that when they are put into practice even we are forced to acknowledge their so f***

1037
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Stupid

1038
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,871
Lucky you know they they try and get us

1039
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:58,271
To take over counties in Idaho backfire good idea and then when it turns out they're bad idea

1040
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Is it probably their fault

1041
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,183
Probably pretty strong like

1042
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
Don't go to March on Washington

1043
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,743
Amazing

1044
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,047
That's amazing

1045
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
It's just

1046
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
You just never that it's never not

1047
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,679
Arkadelphia

1048
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,239
On this episode took a lot of calls

1049
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
And I

1050
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
I did get

1051
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,567
The sense that he was getting annoyed at them

1052
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
But it was

1053
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,479
It wasn't like Edward ever any real blow up

1054
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,807
Then the are you at are you having a feud with another caller

1055
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,111
F*** you talking about that moment

1056
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,183
Then these people are bringing up these other

1057
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:41,535
Boca Gary demott and brick Stanley Alex is kind of being

1058
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Hey

1059
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,631
Don't don't bring up other people on my show

1060
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,935
I'm a patriot Arrow

1061
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,495
There is a little bit of him being like

1062
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,055
God I wish my callers weren't all so stupid

1063
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:59,455
ISO or I wish they weren't promoting other people they were more my

1064
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
I wish they weren't

1065
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,319
Play Kirby on my team for my show instead of

1066
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:08,415
Throwing wrenches in it every time it is it's a slight disappointment

1067
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
Addresses

1068
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,935
I'm just mad

1069
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
New World Order

1070
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:29,407
Newworldorder alligator

1071
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:36,831
I'm not going to do I'm not going to be like I'm having a bad day or hungover I'm never going to do that again

1072
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,231
I'm just going to be like listen I'm sorry I snapped at you I'm an alligator mad at the New World Order

1073
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
Can't stop snapping

1074
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
Because of the New World Order

1075
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,119
I think so like if you

1076
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
You hear that

1077
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
It sounds more genuine

1078
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,727
It sounds more sincere than

1079
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,543
His like apologies for outburst in the present day

1080
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,127
There is he has a headache

1081
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:07,039
But he's just mad at the New World Order and that's like maybe with these colors

1082
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
I think

1083
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
I think you probably

1084
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,415
We're about to have a weekend

1085
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,255
Mentally checked out of here I got a headache

1086
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,655
Who writes all these people are dicks but I'm going to take the high road and be like I'm just mad at the New World Order sorry guys I don't mean to be an ass

1087
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
Albright

1088
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
A human thing

1089
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
Hey

1090
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
We're all good

1091
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Yeah

1092
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,895
Scorpio

1093
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,711
He wants to touch back on this this cannibals

1094
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:40,831
I'm sure kind of get a sense of what's going on here

1095
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
The wrong

1096
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:30,239
So this is what I was talking about earlier this strategic aspects there's a stupid game that Alex is playing

1097
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,519
Really what he's doing and what

1098
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,823
What kind of response he's likely to elicit

1099
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
He's not talking about the

1100
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,431
His case of the German cannibal as it really exists

1101
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,759
He's using it as a data point to attack the entire population

1102
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,855
Gay people by applying the facts of this one cannibal to the entire community

1103
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
He knows what he's doing

1104
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,951
Is goal is to malign and dehumanize gay people

1105
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,607
He knows the people will see through that he's going to get some criticism for a which he'll just say is people trying to in

1106
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
Cuz he doesn't want people to

1107
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Eating each other

1108
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:05,055
It's a simple sleight-of-hand trick where you trying to mask the homophobia that

1109
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,335
Behind his rhetoric

1110
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
With this

1111
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
There's like all they say I'm such a big

1112
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:15,551
Because I don't like animals here I am using one story

1113
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
Denigrated entire group people without any connection between the two whatsoever

1114
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,999
How people are calling me a bigot

1115
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,047
I want for the left

1116
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,631
He wasn't paying

1117
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
Super close attention to

1118
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,239
Things in 2003 around cannibal news

1119
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,591
But I wouldn't bet that they're worse at least some people

1120
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
Who were saying that like

1121
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
You do have a right

1122
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
To agree to

1123
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,599
Have yourself eating sure I would guess that a lot of a libertarian

1124
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,999
You only you can sell your leg for $100,000 for food

1125
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,143
I guess that's fine if you're a Libertarian right I would assume so

1126
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:08,543
Entering into it is 8 like being coerced into the contract that we could see why Liberty

1127
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,175
Libertarian can sell with kidney on the black market then I should be able to sell my leg on the black market right

1128
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,015
If it's for a transplant

1129
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:24,415
Like maybe eight maybe it offends your sensibilities

1130
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:30,815
I mean how do you say scientist would feel about you taking an organ and putting it in somebody else

1131
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,375
Somebody that would be very unhappy with it probably

1132
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
The matter of

1133
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
Respect

1134
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,191
J.d.

1135
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:43,871
I think that there probably were some voices that were like that but Alex's mischaracterizing it is like the entire left is just like

1136
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,663
Yeah hooray for eating people

1137
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Because he knows that

1138
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,271
If people catch on to the game

1139
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Yeah the homophobic game but he's playing

1140
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,391
He has that in his back pocket as like a preemptive

1141
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
Right

1142
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
It's it's

1143
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,999
Hesitate to call it

1144
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,791
Smart crafts

1145
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,607
There's a little bit of a strategy

1146
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
Not not smart

1147
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,703
It's it's like a it's like what you would describe a rat

1148
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,823
As having not intelligence but the low level of God

1149
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
It's just

1150
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
Recognizing

1151
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
The likely consequences of

1152
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
The rhetoric leader of disseminating

1153
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
And planning in advance

1154
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,343
To not have to own the consequences

1155
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
It is it is fun though

1156
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
To make up stereotypes that are that batshit

1157
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
I mean

1158
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
Is as it is expensive

1159
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
It is bigger

1160
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,655
But at the same time if there was like a Def Jam comic

1161
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
In the 90s who is like

1162
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,031
Never noticed how gay people be eating legs like this

1163
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
I think you'd be like yeah that's

1164
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,431
That's insane man that's the craziest f****** stereotype I've ever heard that's insane

1165
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:56,319
Yeah if I saw it I wouldn't think joke was funny probably

1166
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:02,463
Intrigued

1167
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,743
But for Alex's

1168
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
It's a little bit lesson

1169
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
Intriguing cuz you know what a true today

1170
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,631
Yeah it's just pure bigotry but but

1171
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Heard of syrtis

1172
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,823
So we come to the end of this 2003 episode and you know I think that

1173
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
Cannibals got a lot of attention

1174
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,711
Not enough anymore

1175
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,503
Deep homophobia

1176
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
Throughout this

1177
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
The collars

1178
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,903
Are much more interesting

1179
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,463
I think in the past and in the present

1180
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
And that's because I think

1181
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,559
Make that a lot of them are

1182
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,143
Really interested in weird Fringe

1183
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:47,519
Militia e-community you bring some of that sensibility to Alex's show

1184
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Where is Maui

1185
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
He doesn't take a whole lot of colors

1186
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,127
Most of them just

1187
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,223
Parrot back to him what he said

1188
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,015
Just a plug for a product right

1189
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
And then there's like Carlos

1190
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
Canada

1191
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
Calls in every f****** time Alex takes calls

1192
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
And

1193
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
It's just it's it's

1194
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
Not

1195
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,023
It's not like this

1196
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
I mean idiots

1197
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
Almost

1198
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,631
Cute but I think the word I'm thinking of it

1199
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
Quaint

1200
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
Glycol of these callers

1201
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
Are almost Queen

1202
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,775
It's like look at you with your

1203
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,591
Guy from Denver is

1204
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,895
This is a bleeding Appalachia

1205
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,431
It's it's

1206
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
You know what it is

1207
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
Quaintness it feels like a sustainable ecosystem

1208
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:35,391
It hasn't self-selected out for Bluetooth

1209
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,999
Even though it's a bigoted show and

1210
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,535
You know obviously everything is

1211
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
Saying a stupid or awful

1212
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,423
It doesn't feel destined for collapse

1213
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,447
No it really doesn't

1214
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,775
If there's not there's not like a feeling of

1215
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:57,151
It doesn't feel destined for Success either though kind of feels like if this

1216
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,199
This exact show happened

1217
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,503
Everyday with an audience of like

1218
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,831
200,000 people it could have gone on forever

1219
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,927
You know like this could have just been played out every day for the rest of our lives

1220
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:14,047
No one would have really known about it but him and the 200,000 people and it would have been fine

1221
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
But

1222
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
But here we are

1223
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
Is ambitions

1224
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:25,055
What you going to do it like icarus's wings flew him too close to the Sun that's only it weren't a pattern that played out every

1225
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,103
Single f****** day

1226
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,175
You got in bed with mr. blood

1227
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:34,527
That was that that was where it all falls apart

1228
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,087
Mr. Mudd and mr. gold

1229
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:46,303
Probably back to the present day we'll see if Alex has vacation at last the rest of the week

1230
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
Maybe he's in the forest for good could be

1231
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,959
I am become all the time

1232
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:59,615
I will see.

1233
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
Jordan

1234
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,223
But until then I'm needle I'm Leo and bcx Clark I'm

1235
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
Doctor marble

1236
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
What the sex robot

1237
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
Holding

1238
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,487
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
