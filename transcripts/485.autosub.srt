00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
Acknowledge

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392

00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

8
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
That is all

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
Yes no

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
I had heard the expression

12
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
Sleeping child

13
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,112
Pressured

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
I ordered it

15
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,608
Because of the weather longer afraid of thunderstorm

16
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
It is a thunder blanket

17
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
It it I don't really

18
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,896
It makes a really good body pillow

19
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Cuz it's kind of heavy

20
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
Naked girls more like

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,136
Feels like a person

22
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
It's 88

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
Weighted blanket

24
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
More spread out pillow

25
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
Something along those lines

26
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,120
Discovered

27
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,960
Do karaoke music

28
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,688
The last time

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
No

30
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
That was one of my karaoke

31
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,240
Musical theatre kids

32
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
But Kevin's the guy who's the most theatrical David Bowie song

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
How did Life on Mars is the most theatrical story

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Space Oddity

35
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,720
I would say more like

36
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Choices he's really only

37
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
If you're like wasted

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
And a group of people are there that you don't know private karaoke

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
So weird

40
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
It's not fun

41
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,672
Yeah

42
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,495
There's something you're saying something with your choices

43
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Or weird them out

44
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,175
Write you enjoy performance you don't like the pressure of then having to see the person a couple hours later and have them be like

45
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Feedback

46
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439

Plenty of sanding

48
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
It was a fantastic time

49
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583

00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Enjoy doing it again even with

53
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,135
The alcohol

54
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
I do

55
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
I think we if we got drunk together or no

56
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
Oh I wish I could karaoke

57
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
When there was only one set of footprints I was karaoke

58
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
In order to make an episode

59
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Painfully word Undead

60
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
There's nothing new coming out of carry-over Project Camelot

Bummer

62
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,111
Have an appointment with you where we listen to

63
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
I realize like an hour before we were going to record that my computer doesn't accept

64
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
Interesting.

65
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:45,247
We don't have the capability there's a VHS player has like a USB

66
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
CD drive I can probably get

67
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,439
And maybe we'll do that

68
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
I don't want to put out garbage

69
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
Episode just to put something out so here we are

70
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
Maybe better for it

Shout out to my word

Also I grew up in West Dakota north south

88
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
And my

You're Beautiful song

We're coming for your balls

103
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Very few people

104
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
When they are

105
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815

To your local charity or bail

110
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:29,919
Alex is kind of obsessing about how there's 40 days left till the election

111
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Until the election

112
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,255
I felt like I was going to be alright recovering this episode

113
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,071
Why didn't you say 40 days and 40 nights

114
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
The Jesus references

115
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
On a platter for him if he disagrees with him

116
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
That's true

117
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Alright cool

118
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
About

Some culture War

120
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
Now there's a new phenomenon

121
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
The war on Christmas

122
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
Celebrating

123
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271

345

125
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Children as well

126
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
This is a group

127
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Psychotic demon

128
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Wow

129
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,583
Leaving the show with it

130
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Celebrating

131
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,615
We spending his time turning dance sides into evidence of demonic possession amongst his enemies or whatever

132
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
This doesn't even really deserve discussion other than the kind of stupid

133
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,671
The only other thing I would like to point out here is that the article about the hunt

134
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,511
As is his style

135
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
From Anonymous people on the internet

136
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
This is kind of how they're fake outrage nonsense work

137
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
They find something momentarily popular online

138
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
Something that actually is or they can portray as a disproportionately popular

139
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Article

140
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
And yet another desperate effort for dopamine and social media clout parents and siblings

141
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
African American

142
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
Arsene lip-syncing to the song Baby by blueface

143
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,583
Next step in the process

144
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,935
It's actually something really need or whatever

145
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
They also will remember in a week

146
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
Being outraged bakley about something else indeed

147
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,783
Because no one except people who are online

148
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
The only comment they can ever get on it is for people to go by owner 1488 and Sir slurs a lot

149
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,559
Would you getting clean outside of credit in those people

150
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
The entire article is fake

151
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,519
It's a performance and it exists to justify

152
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,407
Children

153
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
Mcoles enabling Alex to demonize his perceived enemies

154
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
But when you get down to the bottom of what supporting that

155
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,183
Just a couple of Tik Tok videos

156
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
It's meaningless ultimately

157
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:00,095
Kindle Fire that Alex needs to keep constantly stay

158
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,471
It's an excuse to say what you were going to say about the last excuse to say what you were going

159
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
The last excuse you were going to say which is

160
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,759
Indeed.com

161
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Let's do the same thing

162
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
You scroll through the comments on his article

163
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
The coverage

164
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
I know any of these days

165
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,383
Is a water essay what respect they should stop us

166
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
The user on there

167
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,303
One of the few leftist ideas I supported publicly-funded abortion for the underclass

168
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
It will do until we make sterilization a prerequisite for receiving welfare

169
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,519
Blind

170
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Two users

171
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
Blast concussion replies

172
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:36,607
Because it's not easy and requires personal effort critical thinking skills and taking individual responsibility

173
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
This is a story that Alex feels the desire to cover not because it means anything

174
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
Obviously to someone who's there to catch the baby

175
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
It because this kind of story presented the way Paul presents the story gets across the subtler white identity messaged

176
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
The actual point

177
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,927
Discussion

178
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,279
You hide behind

179
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
Fake moral outrage

180
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,775
Appropriate to talk about you can just say

181
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Racist things everyday people get born

182
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:23,455
Do you have to create a fictitious reason to say a racist thing

183
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Emotionally outraged be like

184
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
You know what you do is you create these false moral outrages around things Direct

185
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
Service stotler points about

186
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,751
Classes and invulnerable.

187
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
21

188
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
You know all of these people have a playing with your morality or

189
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
No value

190
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
You won't stand up

191
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Turn your emotions

192
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,071
Oh

193
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Tortorices

194
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Moral

195
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
4

196
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Now we are also doing that

197
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
You're quite a while now

198
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
Creek

199
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Police and I'm like I want to have a nice relax

200
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,319
Incidentally

201
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:10,719
We're super for them this is actually

202
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,071
The press conference last week

203
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
Whose Health has been harmed by exposure to burn pits

204
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
I hate Jon Stewart

205
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
John's dedicated a large part of his time

206
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
The one thing celebrity people who needs causes

207
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:35,551
Allowed to do that right right had to bring something

208
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,623
Cuz nobody wants to talk about anything else

209
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,255
That's why they gave him a press conference must be

210
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,583
Press conference for veterans

211
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,703
Public Health guidance

212
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:58,335
His responsibilities for a legitimate cause I don't think anyone's going to be too mad about it

213
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
You just can't be mad with your whole point is

214
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
Being irresponsible and the message is basically that you just want to yell at people for attention

215
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Trivial for VA benefits

216
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,767
Actually talk about benefits

217
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:23,423
And they would be able to speak

218
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
And anyway with about.

219
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Getting into the nitty-gritty

220
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,735
Right

221
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
The

222
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,207
Announcement of the charges or lack thereof

223
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
Surrounding the killing of breonna Taylor

224
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Where do 2 come out

225
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
I think things are happening like the state of emergency

226
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
Where is like

227
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
In advance of this decision we're going to close down everything and if you were going to shoot

228
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Okay

229
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:13,343
You got a real sense of what was coming I'm pretty sure those were just precautionary

230
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
So Alex is aware of this

231
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
Gotta prepare

232
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
For what could come

233
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,240
Taylor's findings and the rest of it

234
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
What

235
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,024
This is the standard stock response of non-white people

236
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:59,680
And circumstances

237
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
Abortion is murder

238
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,920
It's a deflection because he knows that what happened to breonna Taylor is unacceptable

239
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
About a woman's killing

240
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
After dylann roof killed 9 people

241
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:33,984
Have you Manuel African Methodist Episcopal Church

242
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
This is a trick that uses

243
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:47,296
I've been over this a number of times but it's always important to remember that this is treatment

244
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,856
Exclusively used to justify or minimize the death

245
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Of non-white people

246
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Personal responses

247
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
The Accidental

248
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,984
Indianapolis who's killed in early July

249
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:12,640
In both of those cases Alex lied about the circumstances

250
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
Cuz they were white

251
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,088
These are Fingerprints of the racist editorial position that Infowars and it's designed this way on purpose

252
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,648
You might not see these things

253
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
If you weren't paying attention

254
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,768
Work incredibly weather

255
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
And before they know it

256
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Accepted or become

257
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Numb

258
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
Two things that should be shockingly racist

259
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
That's that's the goal

260
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
Yeah it's it's hard to

261
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,152
It's hard to look at that and not see a little bit of

262
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Peloton

263
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Look if you're reading that

264
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
You don't catch the racism there

265
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,624
Problems happen way before

266
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
Like there's no way you know like

267
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:02,816
This is not something that you just started like you didn't click on it Infowars length as reversed

268
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Because of abortion

269
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,960
Like you're going to go

270
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
You're going to go back and you're going to find a lot of s*** along the way

271
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
Like if you read it it doesn't

272
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Sound the same

273
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,416
You just hear him

274
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,304
Like a good stand-up joke

275
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
People can say things that are unconvincing and stupid

276
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Of him

277
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,408
Trojan horse races today

278
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
No

279
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Temperature

280
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,552
Sure I'm just saying that it seems

281
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
Transparently obvious

282
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
What he's doing

283
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Yes you know like

284
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,048
How can you not a failure of critical thinking education

285
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Imagine

286
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,472
Encounter with their guard up

287
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
It's not

288
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:18,080
It's fair for us necessarily to look at

289
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,200
A casual listener of his show in the same way that we do it

290
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,296
Exercise then

291
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
Someone who is just hurting

292
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:34,976
Tune again cuz I may be curious about a conspiracy or liar

293
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
And then you hear it you know you hear what are you saying maybe

294
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:45,216
United maybe You're vulnerable 272 religious overtones they were able to something else in

295
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
A lot of baby stupid

296
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
You start to make rational ride

297
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,432
Oh it's possible

298
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,272
Got to be something in class like a literal like a

299
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,088
Here is what a bad faith statement looks like

300
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
Like this is a classic what about

301
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,024
Show me alarm to look out for

302
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Switch it up

303
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
I'm just I'm just saying we need to bring back the paddle in schools

304
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:21,824
Think you might have gone off the rails.

305
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
Stuff and

306
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,688
Keys got some of his memories confused

307
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
But it says we can't find it

308
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Do you feel the baby

309
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
We checked and we love it and we talk

310
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Talk to him

311
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Wheat wheat we make jokes

312
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
Turns me on

313
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Cousin

314
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
What are they doing

315
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
I know I love

316
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
This is their culture

317
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:22,496
Videos that he used to yell about a lot

318
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Is getting an abortion

319
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:29,920
The other the documentary show that includes footage of a woman

320
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
Is her having an orgasm

321
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,064
Projected onto the footage

322
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
In the actual

323
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Look at yourself

324
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Another stuff is like

325
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
Stray clips of Alex City

326
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
Brenna reproductive Health Brown

327
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
I think

328
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
I think my biggie

329
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,032
The thing that it were seen payoff is the Avengers of

330
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
His narrative

331
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,128
Overtime because he forgets

332
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
That's what specifically you talkin about

333
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,992
You just reference is a melange

334
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,856
Five different things that he probably reference at some point in time and because you know that

335
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:14,208
You reference something like that in the past your like I will this must be the story

336
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
Not he's just putting together five different stories for no reason other than for fun you know

337
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,384
Catalog

338
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,944
Can we stop pretending like abortion doesn't feel good

339
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,040
This was written by Nicole Mullen

340
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:46,720
Alex is taking the stuff troll article

341
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
The video of people saying they get off from having abortions

342
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,424
It legitimately embarrassing stuff

343
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
A normal person would be told that the stuff that they're reporting on was written specifically to make people like them who believe both

344
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
Intuit look stupid

345
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,184
Embarrassing

346
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
Hold that against him

347
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
Or can't see through it

348
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:23,584
He's buried alive prank

349
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,680
Because by definition anyone who would care doesn't take him serious way

350
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:34,336
Bethel Mercy

351
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
Issues like reproductive health

352
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,968
Affected by altitude embarrassing rant about an internet prank

353
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,064
The stories are fake with a radicalization is real

354
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Yep

355
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
It's something that you wish you could just laugh at like

356
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,376
Doesn't it said it doesn't matter the killing 200,000

357
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
It doesn't matter they just don't

Mia

359
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
The bomber

360
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
They just hate the left

361
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
But it was only God

362
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,992
Does seem like a lot of it

363
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:18,624
Is that weird week discovered impregnation p***

364
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
The role-playing

Post

366
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
Cultural panic

Kinkshaming size people is going to really teaches all

00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,304
Alex used to report covid-19

376
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,448
In reality it was because the flu season stop posting updates on the total

377
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:42,592
How does repeated enough times

378
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:48,224
Which is to say that around the world there are no cases of the flu being reported cuz they're all just calling me covid-19

379
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
Monitoring update from the world

380
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,696
Organization dated September 14th 2020

381
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,000
Reflecting data up to September 1st

382
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,912
Generally speaking and blue season starts to pick up in October so you wouldn't expect

383
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
Cases yet at this point

384
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
Is up to

385
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
The report shows that the number of samples returning positive

386
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Or at a lower level

387
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:24,320
But the most likely explanation for that

388
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Staffing in route

389
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,768
As well as testing priorities and capacities and member states

390
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
Another consideration that's given is the quote various hygiene

391
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,800
Goodbye member states to reduce the risk of virus transmission have played a role in reducing

392
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Influenza virus transmission

393
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
It's important to remember that the very actions of people are taken to minimize the spread of covid-19

394
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
The spread of influenza

395
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,392
Who is a decent chance it when it's all said and done this may end up being a lower flu rates

396
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
This year than in past years

397
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:05,792
At this stage it's really hard to predict what's going to come

398
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
It's pretty clear that there are cases of influenza being tracked

399
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,824
Those cases

400
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,224
That's why they didn't create combat his

401
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,808
Time travel

402
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:33,184
Viruses that are being watched right now in Cambodia

403
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:39,840
That's what Alex is doing

404
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:46,240
Also that article in The Emperor's New Clothes on September 22nd has nothing

405
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
To do with covid-19 or even China

406
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,760
And who happens to be

407
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,904
Seems like Alex whatever really hard time

408
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,560
Consequences

409
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Something completely unrelated

410
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,056
Easier

411
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:27,456
Yep videos of apparently blacklivesmatter protesters

412
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
Something that I don't even

413
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
I don't know

414
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
08 quick update real real quick

415
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,664
Directions

416
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Blackline

417
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Horrible evil

418
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Black white

419
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Coming up

420
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
Horrible things to life

421
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
It's just so sad

422
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Diversion

423
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
And so sad

424
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
So evil

425
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
AR

426
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
On this

427
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Crazy

428
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Randall Flagg

429
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
What

430
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Flamethrower

431
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Okay

432
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,752
I thought that when you got on Arrow your pain went away okay

433
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:33,152
All right yeah I find it difficult to listen to somebody

434
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,736
XOXO

435
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
Velcro

436
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,280
Q

437
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,864
All of your petty b******* is what you care about

438
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
I don't want to wear a mask.

439
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
People are dying

440
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,712
And we're innocent

441
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
Over and over and over again

442
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,648
But I'd rather

443
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:22,560
He was difficult for him and probably ever

444
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,120
I wish I want to talk about that hike

445
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,680
Instead of basically saying like

446
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
What I'm really mad about is that black people are intruding upon my perfect little white world where I

447
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,408
I don't have to think about how all the consequences of my actions

448
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,736
Disproportionately affect those with less money

449
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,440
I remember that we were laughing the earlier this month

450
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
About Alex declaring

451
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
Libertarianism

452
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Would like to clarify

453
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Ron

454
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,008
About

455
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,592
Clarifying a statement

456
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
Liberty

457
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Call bunch of smug

458
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,808
Didn't mean that it was stupid

459
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
The tea party was a stripper

460
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,632
We already do that

461
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
Social issues a libertarian

462
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Are they

463
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
Party City

464
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
They just support

465
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:36,448
Someone really funny is that Alex is so dumb libertarianism

466
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
It's completely untenable

467
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Tireli impossible to implement in the real world

468
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:50,016
That's the easiest thing to dismiss

469
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:58,464
Bumper sticker level Kia

470
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
Can you be a like

471
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
A little

472
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
Libertarian isn't it part of the libertarian philosophy that you're always with libertarianism

473
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
I'm a Libertarian but I do love socialism

474
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:27,392
Being an economic libertarian was the stupidest thing he's ever done but I couldn't find any

475
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,816
As far as I can tell there wasn't any big Message Board uproar

476
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
But the only time that's come up behind on her episode

477
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:55,040
Isn't a lot of anger about what Alex said in the comics

478
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,072
I heard no one other than us

479
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,376
Discuss this

480
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
It's

481
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
It's not proof of anything but

482
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,776
F****** weird clarification

483
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Maybe it's a situation where like some of those weirdo friends who I came are that's not cool

484
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,992
AG Edward Griffin gave the talking to or something

485
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,856
Libertarian

486
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,720
Libertarian

487
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:40,096
You know and no consequence

488
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
He says a vitamin

489
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
7 mineral

490
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Yeah

491
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,336
I would describe this

492
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
Killing time

493
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
4

494
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
10

495
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,975
Doesn't minerals

496
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,303
Jschlatt

497
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
What's a joke

498
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
Central vitamin

499
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
There's only 20

500
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
What

501
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:50,239
What are we doing everything first results

502
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:56,639
Give me whatever I'm not going to do any research myself this is my favorite game to play it on Alex's Show from

503
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:03,039
Time to time

504
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,463
Either be like yep I was right or he'll reject whatever comes up

505
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,815
30 bedrooms

506
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,239
Not even write a couple times

507
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Talking about

508
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Subway

509
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,271
It's just like salad

510
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,111
Kitchen

511
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
It's not working

512
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Call Zarina moment

513
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,975
Where is uninspiring

514
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,983
Commercial

515
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:33,151
Something smells it's not

516
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Storing food

517
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
Veronica

518
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
Unless they're doing

519
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Promo

520
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Website

521
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:53,631
Interesting to me URL

522
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,423
Prepare with aleks.com

523
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:00,543
Exit the existence of that URL indicates to me a change in the status quo

524
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:04,639
Something about the relationship between Alex and my Patriot Supply looks like

525
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
Change

526
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,551
Go like something you might see you in the partnership is getting scaled-back

527
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,951
How many you prepare with Alex for my Patriot Supply

528
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:24,351
You directing people to that website to track the business and purchases that are prompted by

529
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,703
Let me figure out what that's worth the pay him for his advertising

530
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
Yeah it gets like an affiliate link and all that

531
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,383
Specific businesses

532
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,039
I've given their pitch persons URLs that are prepare with x.com

533
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,695
Shapiro promotes preparewithglenn.com

534
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,487
Shapiro tries to sell you food

535
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,911
Another right-wing

536
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,959
Be horrific Common Sense Show

537
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751

538
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,847
Which takes you to Atlantic page

539
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,431
Franchi The Lunatic YouTube show called

540
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
News Network

541
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,527
Go to prepare

542
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:20,927
You can take advantage of a really good Limited

543
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
Get one of those

544
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Positive

545
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,543
My favorite

546
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:51,135
If you are advertising in the same way Alex Jones is taken down

547
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,719
Shapiro Glenn Beck

548
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,559
Puns about last night I just got into a hole

549
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:04,959
Prepare with

550
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:11,359
License plate

551
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
With great

552
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
It is

553
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,087
Jreg

554
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
The URL is spelled with a g r e y

555
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
His picture is like a silver plaque

556
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
YouTube

557
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:55,391
It's really hard to expect

558
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
I'm sure the arrangements he's had with my Patriot Supply before we're far more entwined or his Sales Systems into their back

559
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Does he described

560
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,167
Well Alex wouldn't have been shipping

561
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
He still be processing payments

562
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,751
Where is this arrangement

563
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
Just be Alex having an affair

564
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,151
Facilitator system where is only real involvement

565
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,223
Is trying to direct traffic to that land

566
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
Better system for him

567
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
Prepare with Alex because

568
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,607
Now he is just Ben Shapiro videos of him

569
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,935
Doing like a trucking

570
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,263
Paint with Michel I want him to do the Bob Ross

571
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,335
Preparing a preparation shows

572
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,687
Like standing there and he's like here's one of the things you're going to need what does in the Box

573
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,471
At work

574
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
Boy

575
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,871
We're in prison bad time

576
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Cars

577
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
Then we've been taught that we're not

578
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
Define on

579
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
What's the

580
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,687
Sterilizer

581
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Quilting

582
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
I will think that

583
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,759
Top

584
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,023
Take you out

585
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
That's an efficient system

586
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
Okay so couple things real quick

587
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:53,055
The first thing that strikes me about Alex's literally incapable of imagining

588
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,063
Who's to say that has to be on things operate

589
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,463
I would suggest that it might actually be easier to read Society

590
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,279
Need to go around and send electromagnetic trash trucks

591
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,495
Also I really really think that Alex is just traumatized

592
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,591
Something

593
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
It's amazing

594
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Those trailers for old movies

595
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
Things are so in-depth

596
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
Trailers

597
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,327
Spoilers

598
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,079
Play condition

599
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,479
Kind of cop tell he's not a literal

600
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Like the opening crawl

601
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
Explaining everybody and then

602
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,511
Imagine if the trailer for Spider-Man

603
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,095
Actually just showed you the whole backstory

604
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:26,495
And then they made the better movie they just moved

605
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:34,687
Hinges on white people

606
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:47,487
It's really tough to do that style of trailer but I

607
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,559
How f*****-up it would be if trailers today were like that

608
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,607
Episode

609
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,703
Mobile9 everything but

610
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,007
I don't know

611
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,175
Problems with the plan but he has Global account

612
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:10,271
The first is abused robot trash trucks or take all the people

613
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,671
Population of u.s.a.

614
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Comically large

615
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:22,815
But I guess the robots and robot incinerators or something I don't know

616
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:28,191
Kill you in two weeks raised on the garbage cans incinerator with them

617
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
How long do these electromagnetic waves

618
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,919
From these trash dress

619
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,943
Under Murder

620
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:45,087
Capabilities are City at the same time

621
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,927
Thousands and thousands of trash trucks

622
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,303
U-Save

623
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,703
Are are there?

624
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
Entire block.

625
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
4

626
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
Is there is somebody who doesn't

627
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,719
The program

628
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,511
Yes a great Quest at the great question

629
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:30,911
A problem with a problem

630
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,263
Driving cars or any of that s***

631
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:41,663
According to Alex

632
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,479
Agricultural production happening

633
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
Also their plan is supposed to be to download their brains into silicone bodies and merge with machines

634
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
Food

635
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,119
If everyone were to stay alive

636
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,727
The only reason to create more efficient agricultural systems is to feed more people

637
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:11,871
The only reason to create automated driverless cars at a reduced traffic

638
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
Amazon doesn't need tons of deliveries

639
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:19,295
Consumer-based

640
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:24,415
White people out

641
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,743
Has ways to better survive in a world of growing population

642
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:34,399
What I'm getting at is Alex's stupid there for the plant

643
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:37,983
Levels

644
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
Talking

645
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,103
Yeah makes sense if we are to become

646
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,735
Then it's like

647
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,063
See that's what I'm saying that doesn't make any sense

648
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Okay

649
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,391
Maybe they're going to replace us

650
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,463
With robot people need food

651
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,791
Maybe the only way

652
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,095
That's the only way to keep pee at AI

653
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:08,191
Turning all of us into their food Matrix Style

654
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,527
This is dumb

655
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,927
You just ate you know you just aren't willing to really Workshop the globalist

656
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:35,327
Plans

657
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:40,703
It does seem like

658
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
Around that one

659
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,503
I think come from the like 1950s TV show The Avengers or whatever cuz all of their evil villain plans

660
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
Like even the movie with Sean Connery it's just like wait till you build a weather machine and you're going to do what with it when a cellu weather

661
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:06,047
What's a reasonable people are going to come after you you can't own the weather

662
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
This is also just a guy

663
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,471
Conquered the devil

664
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,775
Timeline

665
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
The timeline of this

666
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Problem

667
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
Yes we will

668
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
They know

669
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
They're going to end

670
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
But that's why we have the Rope

671
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
We've cornered these people

672
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
Have you

673
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
3 +

674
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Sure

675
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
Naturally

676
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,719
Totally

677
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Course

678
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Washing clothes

679
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
Go to the end

680
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,943
Just remember who killed

681
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,735
Okay

682
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,207
They'll rebuild Society

683
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Who's the stupidest s*** I've ever heard

684
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:48,191
If you seriously he's work he's done in his career

685
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,055
Be literal Christian Dental

686
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,919
Alex I need the devil centuries-old

687
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,951
Instakiller

688
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:16,351
Devil's minions like to do things like kill everyone in the world in an orderly fashion

689
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
Piece of nonsense

690
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,127
Devil

691
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,783
Superpower bioweapon

692
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,855
Foreigner original plan

693
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
Is Superplay open

694
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Topian hellscape Zelda

695
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
Justified Justice murders

696
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Siri

697
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
That he is defeating the devil

698
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,079
Christian death

699
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,407
Is In-N-Out itself very Blasphemous towards his religion

700
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,503
Because he is operating on God's plan

701
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:11,903
So you're saying is to get spoiled by Alex

702
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Like God was like okay

703
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
Devil

704
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
That was hilarious

705
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
Go to work

706
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:28,799
And then at the f****** last minute he's like

707
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
The devil's play

708
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
What are you doing

709
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:34,943
You're saying that the god that God is weak enough to have a stupid plan

710
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,247
Like the devil

711
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,319
It is pretty good goof

712
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:45,439
Frank

713
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:52,095
Save the world

714
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Everyone

715
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
The first

716
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,015
Purdue University operating on Godwin

717
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:14,879
And that means god is a stupid idiot

718
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:25,631
Bigger the specific

719
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:30,751
Satanism right is the big evil sign

720
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:35,103
Ganondorf

721
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,967
I'm not worried about Ganondorf

722
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:46,367
I don't need any saviors

723
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
Causes problems I'll just

724
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,863
I'll talk about his plans for a while we like pizza

725
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,263
Public apologies from Alex on his show

726
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:13,759
Devil

727
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:25,279
Not scared

728
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:31,423
Pretty much now is meaningless until after the Apocalypse

729
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
Or the killing off of pretty much a watch

730
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
There isn't anything you can do to stop it

731
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
What are you saying

732
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:43,455
Presumably Alex's entire career has been about avoiding plan a which is digging around with the vaccine to chips

733
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
What is the

734
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
Exactly of Alexandra Daddario

735
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,839
Did what he say

736
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:06,239
Nation of Alex's life's work is getting everyone killed sooner

737
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,031
All you did is

738
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,871
Spoil their plans he made them petulant legal will

739
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,919
We're not having any fun

740
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,975
We won't even bother with

741
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
These cards earlier

742
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,223
Alright literal devil

743
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
Garbage truck

744
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,439
With Satan

745
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,839
Also has a great pitch for Alex

746
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,631
9899 2000

747
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:12,031
Quit yelling at you

748
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:18,687
I should tell you this couple years into my career

749
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,343
Even if everything goes according to plan and we pull this off perfectly we'll all be killed by the globe

750
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:33,279
We are only trying to avert

751
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,071
Sorry

752
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,119
Attraction

753
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
If he presented himself as someone who actually has a f****** shot of

754
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:50,175
The end of his career is where we're at is

755
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,015
There's nowhere to go

756
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,623
This kind of inevitable

757
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
It's going down

758
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,743
And after we do

759
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,303
You will need to come out and execute Justice

760
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,959
Yeah it made because like

761
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,055
A little bit

762
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,639
I mean like Jade Helm is embarrassing

763
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Sandy Hook

764
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
Boston bombing

765
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:27,807
Embarrassing

766
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:32,159
This is this is this is

767
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:36,767
This is doomsday cult I think what like

768
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
Two more times to Doomsday

769
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:45,215
In most Dunes they called diminishing returns the first day around

770
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:49,055
Enough people are going to stick with you that you can go for a second Doomsday

771
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,383
I think that's I think Doomsday cults usually get a second Doom

772
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
Yeah but that's like Ron Paul in 2012

773
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,975
His first run today

774
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Talking about

775
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:15,167
How desperate he is for money

776
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,311
That is true with Alex Alex

777
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,943
They want to wipe everyone out

778
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
Alex

779
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
A bunch of

780
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,679
Stupid and lazy

781
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
Non giving

782
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Sociopath

783
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,151
No you are

784
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
You're Conjuring around destruction

785
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,111
Really

786
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
Alright

787
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,247
Never say that kind of thing into a microphone

788
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,415
The general population of the common person

789
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,815
He's talking about what he thinks he hates everyone

790
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:56,031
He hates people like you and me because we don't see the same patterns of disconnected things that he does

791
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,895
He hates us because according to him our inability to

792
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,503
The wild destroy the world

793
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,599
You could debate whether or not Alex believes any of that it actually

794
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
Religious languages facade that political disenfranchisement

795
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:22,399
Straight white sister

796
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Actually believe

797
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:30,079
Alex paint the general population to the point where he thinks his imaginary enemy

798
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
Please have plans

799
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
He says stuff like this and I pretty much

800
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:37,759
It was the first time he said it

801
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,879
You and for me it's so shocking that you would come on a show and save it as mission is to

802
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,279
That's a fine position

803
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
Yeah what's the Google tacos for dinner

804
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:58,751
In that case the planets feeling you don't like the idea

805
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,847
In this case the plan though is killing billions of people

806
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:08,223
The problem with a plan is not who's doing it it's the killing billions of people Park

807
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:12,319
Planets

808
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:18,975
You just kind of invalidate entire argument about being against the global population thing

809
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,767
Quotes on who should be killed

810
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,327
No I don't think the GOP is

811
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:29,727
What is a where is the rest of us are at that

812
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
Different

813
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
Like that's

814
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:38,687
On the same team

815
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:43,807
We want to be on the other side of Alex's

816
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,647
Yeah that's it

817
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:54,815
Becomes really clear when he says stuff like that

818
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
Petulant child

819
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,519
Because as much as I hate

820
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,055
Political

821
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
Discourse is the common

822
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:12,479
I dislike Trump being in office

823
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,807
Democrats in particular

824
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,855
I spilled

825
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
Would never wish

826
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:25,023
On the general population I want to improve

827
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
I think

828
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:33,471
I do

829
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:40,639
But I don't exactly

830
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:45,247
Touts forever 101

831
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Seized

832
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
Because of him

833
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,231
Other parts

834
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
The plan

835
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
And they're just going to kill everybody

836
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
And it sounds like

837
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,935
He's just annoyed them into skipping the fun part of the plan and then killing everybody

838
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,263
And it seems like the way he's responding

839
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,311
He's very annoyed at everybody

840
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:14,175
And he doesn't want to do all of that bulshit anymore

841
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:20,575
There's something similar to the globalist and Alex

842
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,695
Ultrastat

843
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,999
Some calls

844
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Detective calls

845
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,815
And this guy

846
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,839
Boy

847
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
Blue Collar man

848
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Matter

849
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,975
Liberty or death don't

850
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,535
This caller is all over the place

851
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:06,399
First problem

852
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:13,055
Second problem

853
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,103
Forward slogans written on it with a sharpie

854
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:23,039
I think I would immediately trust like a real estate agent if they were like I'm going to show you this house first

855
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,695
Hey where can I buy one of those

856
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,255
Free with every purchase of a

857
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,887
No it's

858
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:42,495
In the same way there telling her fake

859
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
The consequences are real

860
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
This caller

861
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,639
No reason to think that

862
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:52,223
Archer represents some of the real effects

863
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,271
Sprouts has on people

864
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Welcome

865
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
This is mine

866
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Paintings

867
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,079
Damn listening to you and thanks

868
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
How much is

869
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
See

870
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Take this anymore

871
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Grocery shopping

872
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
It's fine.

873
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
People

874
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
I just

875
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
This is horrible

876
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
That's that's one of those like literally

877
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,143
What's her name if she dies of covid

878
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Alex killed

879
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
All right I mean

880
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:52,895
Seriously fear was more

881
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:57,247
In terms of careful Consciousness as opposed to terrified beer

882
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,647
But seriously in April

883
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Anime

884
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
You can

885
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:12,351
I'll be responsible a number of times

886
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,887
Going to be the thing

887
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,263
It's really unfortunate

888
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,567
Someone who calls

889
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,895
Big big for her it's unfortunate

890
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,967
It's important

891
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,247
You obviously care about her

892
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,807
And then it's unfortunate for

893
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,879
What she represents because this is one caller

894
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,255
And then

895
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:45,631
Even on top of that there's another listening to her testimonial

896
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,751
58 year old person compromise issue

897
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,639
I am home never

898
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
No

899
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,455
If she has any consequence

900
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
Is there any health issues because

901
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,063
She is just someone who called into Alex's show

902
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,159
We'll never know he'll never know he doesn't care meant just

903
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Dark that is 12 dark dark

904
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
This but with

905
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,911
By her own words

906
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,191
If she dies out

907
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
What killed her

908
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:26,335
It's it's a pretty interesting case to try

909
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,383
On a civil level

910
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,199
I just got really depressed me

911
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:40,415
Dr. Mercola Mercola comes on for the

912
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,975
Tower

913
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
Heathcos

914
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
Hard

915
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
This is really funny

916
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:54,239
He's a wanted to ask Alex if he's got his Vitamin D level check

917
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Is so funny

918
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,615
Thank you for Mission Again to stop

919
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,919
No

920
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Email options

921
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,271
Free information

922
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Wow

923
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Why do you say

924
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,679
Absolutely not

925
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:30,079
You have no idea

926
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,383
Did you get your vitamin D levels checked

927
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Wow

928
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,343
Partner

929
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,879
Yeah good sandwich

930
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
I do enjoy earlier

931
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:49,279
This is

932
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Justify talking about dr. Mercola

933
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Seiyuu

934
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Family

935
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
Friend or someone

936
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,063
Do you know where you're at

937
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,463
Anyone get sick and what do you do

938
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,311
Commercial that has

939
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,127
Some stabilizer

940
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Because it doesn't have the stable

941
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,975
I like that we graduated to ask

942
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:59,679
Hydrogen peroxide

943
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,727
Drink it

944
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
Okay

945
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
Duluth

946
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
An inhaler

947
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Now

948
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:17,087
I don't know what else to know whether or not

949
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
In a safe

950
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,975
Environment with an actual doctor applying

951
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,327
Whether or not hydrogen peroxide may have some sort of medicinal benefits

952
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,351
You can't

953
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:32,191
If you are dr. Mercola you can't go on Infowars

954
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:38,591
And tell people to get store-bought hydrogen peroxide dilute it

955
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,871
And f****** inhaler

956
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:45,503
You can't trust that they're going to know how to dilute something correctly that's so dangerous

957
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,303
Controversial

958
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,703
Solutionreach

959
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,543
In the sinuses in your nose that's why you want to use an ass

960
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,103
Get it in your nasal passage

961
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:19,807
Here's what you got to do you got to rub

962
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,343
Vicks VapoRub

963
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
On your a****** and that will protect you from covid now I don't sell

964
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:48,735
Consult with your physician beautiful Healthcare professionals

965
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Realistic we just take a rocket science

966
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:56,159
I just believe that 99.9% water and point

967
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Freeport

968
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Inhaling

969
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Physiologically

970
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:11,007
Indistinguishable from medical advice

971
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
Excuse me Jackie Robinson

972
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,384
I was thinking of hydrogen peroxide

973
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,968
Do you think that's a good idea

974
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
Poison

975
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:32,000
I would love to see the look on his face

976
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,192
So you want to do it

977
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:46,848
I just imagined house

978
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,432
What are the people in his Clinic

979
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:57,088
Nebulizer

980
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,208
Desire to not get sued

981
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,744
Obviously

982
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,280
Consult a physician

983
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,376
I'm not positive

984
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:16,800
Threshold for Dangerous delusions of

985
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
That I don't trust

986
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
The listeners of this program

987
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:26,272
Possibly

988
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:30,112
You can't guarantee that these people are going to accurately dose

989
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:36,512
Things are household cleaner

990
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,096
Be sure you only have a little

991
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
Ever not like

992
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:53,920
Oh well if this works I wonder if I should just smell it

993
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,528
Everybody's going to do stupid s*** with this

994
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:03,648
Alex wants to be clear that he just believes this

995
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,216
Plugging somebody else

996
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:25,408

41 minutes

1001
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864

3 minutes at like I want I want

1011

Figures like I could cut a section of this

01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,488
Like if I played a minute of it

1013
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,816
Feel like

1014
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
But why not play at all

1015
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,104
Alright

1016
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,992
I would like to get inside the mind of somebody's like you know what I need to call Infowars and

1017
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,784
Crayon are 43 minutes

1018
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:13,184
And I'm going to wait on hold for 2 hours to do it

1019
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,768
That I cannot comprehend

1020
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,704
And of course over the evening news

1021
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
For the officers in Louisville

1022
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,080
They were going around

1023
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
You know

1024
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,464
Mister tough guy

1025
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,096

1026
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,616

Please get out

1029

This is America

1030
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,656
50 yd away not even in their business

1031
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
America

1032
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,128
Noted Beto O'Rourke fans antifa

1033
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,712

Yeah Tifa came out

1036
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,856
Beto

1037
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,904
Beto O'Rourke

1038
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:53,280
Antifa loves to worship Heroes like Beto O'Rourke

1039
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
They didn't like

1040
01:25:55,328 --> 01:26:01,472
His politics are planted at the drive-in

1041
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:09,664
What are

1042
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
How do I activate an effect

1043
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:19,392
Situation

1044
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,184
This is pretty disgusting

1045
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,256
Lying about the circumstances surrounding

1046
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
The Killing

1047
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,072
Kamala Harris

1048
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,400
Tweeting last night

1049
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
Say her name

1050
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
Breonna Taylor

1051
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,592
Who was Winston drug dealer game

1052
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,128
Somebody else called the cops

1053
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
The cops come

1054
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
Call

1055
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,624
Because you were living with a g******* drug dealer

1056
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,024
Lying about the details of the shooting that killed Brianna

1057
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,936
If your horse to cover the story based on the details that exist in reality

1058
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:07,520
Don't really care that much

1059
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:14,176
The shooting did not happen because the neighbor called the police

1060
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,248
The actual information about this

1061
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:22,880
It is about it

1062
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:28,256
More of an honest mistake

1063
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
In reality

1064
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:35,424
The police executed this no-knock warrant because they receive for Taylor's house

1065
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,264
Based on surveillance of a previously carried it sounded her ex-boyfriend

1066
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,848
Had been to her house previously and was under investigation in a drug

1067
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:48,736
Ex-boyfriend it already been arrested across town

1068
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:54,368
The person who was with

1069
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
Alex doesn't understand

1070
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,768
Surrounding

1071
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:06,144
Record which means that they were able to execute it without an ounce

1072
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:13,568
Taylor's boyfriend claims that the only reason he fired a shot it because there was no indication for police

1073
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,872
His claim to be grounded in reality

1074
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:21,504
Considering the fact that there was a record of him calling me please

1075
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:28,416
Meanwhile the police officer

1076
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,304
And I'm going to say that in this circumstance

1077
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,352
You can't trust anything the police say

1078
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:40,448
I think they might lie to the police

1079
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
Someone was breaking in

1080
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,800
Makes it seem like

1081
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,080
Whether or not

1082
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,128
They did announce themselves

1083
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,504
Perhaps it seems strange anyway

1084
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
This is a tragic situation requires is that the people who created

1085
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,696
This situation be held responsible

1086
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:08,352
Absolute disrespect to Brianna Taylor

1087
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:12,448
He is not interested in actually.

1088
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:16,288
But he doesn't care enough to look into it

1089
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,896
It's really disgusting for him to just make up really simple details about a person's killing

1090
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:26,784
Enable him to be mad about other people Justified angry response to the actual reality of that killing

1091
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,624
Be like

1092
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,928
Just accept

1093
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:35,488
We're going to look at you how we're going to look at you for that

1094
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,304
Dyckman can't

1095
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
You can't it doesn't look good

1096
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,632
Enzo

1097
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
He has to make it

1098
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
Okay

1099
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:46,752
Yep just have to make it okay for you to get murdered

1100
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Yeah

1101
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
A baseball bat

1102
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,904
Beer you can see the direction that Alex Jones has coverage goes in

1103
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:09,024
That night in Seattle there were two main stories that went around that had to do with violence at protest

1104
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:15,936
Cover West convenient

1105
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,520
They attack people for no reason

1106
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:23,360
Story

1107
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:30,016
I had to do the video of a police officer on a bike clearly intentional the ground

1108
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:35,392
Intentional because if you watch the footage the cop has to alter his course to run over the guy's head

1109
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:41,024
It could be easily not run over the guys that do not do that but he decided to anyway

1110
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,352
You think it's on the side of giving more weight

1111
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,424
The story about a Cop protected

1112
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,984
Libertarianism

1113
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,944
Armored cop getting hit with a bat

1114
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,504
Alex don't touch stories like that because

1115
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:07,904
You know the ones where the police they're clearly brutalizing protesters because he supports it

1116
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:12,256
Libertarian

1117
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:17,376
But he also wants to be able to live free will consequences

1118
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:22,496
Libertarians don't water police

1119
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
Corporate

1120
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:29,664
A private Army to be the police

1121
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
Because

1122
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:34,016
Exactly

1123
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:38,880
Republic

1124
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:46,048
Is on the show because she went to a Rally in Austin night before

1125
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192

Aware they

1136
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,936
Punch me in

1137
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,728
Sure

1138
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Board of Brianna Taylor

1139
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:40,576
Have a like a lot of video that's because if you if you're the cameraman for Savannah Hernandez

1140
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:46,976
And you see her getting physically attacked you immediately put the camera

1141
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:51,328
Someone pushed her up against the wall and maybe she got

1142
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,680
At least there is one person who's yelling lock her up

1143
01:32:55,936 --> 01:33:02,080
In for a long. Of time

1144
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:08,736
I meant never even people trying to help her find her phone

1145
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:11,808
People help her fart try to help her find her phone

1146
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:18,208
Of course they do because obviously I'm not

1147
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,256
You taking a swing at her but also I get it

1148
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,328
She was there working for Infowars but pretending that she was

1149
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,680
Pretending to work for the Action 7 News

1150
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:32,288
Recognize her as an employee

1151
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:38,944
The reason I understand someone reacting to Savannah being there under false pretenses

1152
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,504
Is actively trying to get protesters killed

1153
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:46,880
The work that she does represent an actual threat to the people who are there protests

1154
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:51,744
Because the product

1155
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,048
Facilitate violence against protesters

1156
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:58,144
End of Justified Violence Against protesters after eating

1157
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:05,056
Better ways to handle the situation than to Pusher but I'm not going to shed a tear on her

1158
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:09,408
Attention

1159
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:14,016
Police

1160
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:18,880
She was attacked for supporting the police

1161
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:22,464
Predictable

1162
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,280
Independent journalist instead of what she actually

1163
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,816
Infowars provocateur

1164
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:33,728
Laura Ingraham earn a tough predicament because they promote the stuff that Infowars

1165
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,008
Completely embarrassing

1166
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:39,104
And they can never really associate with it you keep any kind of credibility

1167
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,920
Directions

1168
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:48,320
Oportun

1169
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:52,160
They go out of their way to cover up they work for Alex Jones

1170
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,696
What's your message

1171
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Literally

1172
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Or I would

1173
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Alright

1174
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,600
It's required for these two worlds

1175
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,648
Conservative propaganda to collaborate

1176
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,304
We have to believe to completely unbelievable things in order for that clip to be understood is Laura Ingraham

1177
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:37,984
First we have to believe that no one at Fox Google Savannah Hernandez prior to her being on the show

1178
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:43,104
It is literally no background research by Alex Jones

1179
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:49,760
Second

1180
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:54,112
He works for a presumably believe

1181
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:59,232
Those two things are completely unbelievable and the only explanation for the performance

1182
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,840
Is apple cider keenly aware that pretending it doesn't exist benefits

1183
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:10,496
Laura Ingraham journalist

1184
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
The elephant in the room

1185
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:17,920
At the same time

1186
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:24,320
Police lives matter sign

1187
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:31,232
Breonna Taylor

1188
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:37,888
The footage most people in that are in this duffle or trying to separate Savannah and someone else

1189
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
How's that she's fighting Westshore

1190
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:45,312
It's not a gang attack and like looking for her phone

1191
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,872
If anybody wanted to hurt her she would have been her

1192
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,896
Yeah I guarantee

1193
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:52,736
Yeah there's no there's no

1194
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
There's no

1195
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,368
This bother just bums me out because

1196
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,976
Exception of maybe

1197
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,280
The person that you was fighting with

1198
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,072
It's tough to tell from the

1199
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Assuming

1200
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,400
Hit somebody did

1201
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,704
Start getting physical with her whatever

1202
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,008
Everybody operated how they should have

1203
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:18,336
Yeah you're not trying to break it up trying to keep people separated

1204
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:24,736
Exactly what you'd want to do

1205
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,504
Would someone write

1206
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,552
Curbing at this part

1207
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,600
Because if you do nothing

1208
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:36,256
Going to get video going to misrepresent it's going to be used to attack you if you try to

1209
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:42,912
Joe claimed she was attacked by a big gang of men with guns play the victim card

1210
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
Show

1211
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:46,496
There's a situation

1212
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
That you have

1213
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
When

1214
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:51,616
Breaker stuff

1215
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,992
Take take take

1216
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:00,832
Like a her phone instead of you should help look for her phone

1217
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
And if you find it first

1218
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:08,512
You should Smash It On The Ground in front of her views expressed by Jordan do not

1219
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,912
A position I can I still don't Advocate to break people's

1220
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:25,152
Total Clarity I wouldn't judge you if you don't support

1221
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
No no

1222
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:31,296
In the same way after watching this video I obviously don't

1223
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,344
I don't think violence is good

1224
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,392
I do

1225
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Don't

1226
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,720
Are

1227
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,840
Don't hurt people

1228
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:47,680
Anything that's not people

1229
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,216
Like a buildings

1230
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:55,104
So Alex

1231
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
I'm stuff

1232
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,200
Kind of not all that interesting

1233
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,552
I only kept this in because he says something that I think is pretty expensive

1234
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,112
Worshiper

1235
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,232
Why are they killing all those

1236
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Florida man

1237
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
Because you might think you got a man

1238
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
Oh no

1239
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:32,224
How to fight back against that women don't possess

1240
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,040
And I'm going to need to see a citation on that

1241
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
Sure

1242
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:40,160
Beyond really complex picture behind the reality of human traffic

1243
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:47,072
A large amount of it does have to do with sex trafficking but another huge sector involves labor trafficking literally

1244
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:53,472
Slavery people find themselves in the position project

1245
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:59,872
The largest factor in their victimization with migration or relocation

1246
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,944
I fell prey to work

1247
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,736
And false promises and fraud

1248
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:10,368
This is just looking at Stats with the United States

1249
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
It sometimes appears a sex traffic

1250
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,976
And sometimes appears as labor trafficking

1251
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:21,376
These are issues that are not exclusive to either man or women

1252
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:28,032
Also if you keep men as slaves for so long

1253
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:33,408
Wework

1254
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:35,968
Remember

1255
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:40,064
Everybody got stabbed

1256
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:46,208
California firefighters were all murdered by the slave labor that they used to fight fires to remember

1257
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
No

1258
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,280
Right now

1259
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,328
Their dad right

1260
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
How is

1261
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:58,752
12yearsaslave possible

1262
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:01,568
That is a good point

1263
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:04,384
He was Ball parking it Alex

1264
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,688
Has Robert Barnes on

1265
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:13,344
Wanted to talk about how coneybear it's not a great pick for the Supreme Court

1266
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:29,216
Yeah I don't know what that I don't I don't care to get in on their little game

1267
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,520
However

1268
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:38,432
My job for this is going to cheer you up hour

1269
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:42,272
Pay close attention to our casa Valley

1270
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
In Germany 90

1271
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
Excuse

1272
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
Rise above

1273
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,264
Emergency

1274
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
Emergency except

1275
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
Action to the

1276
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Illegally

1277
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
Anyone that's pushing me

1278
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:29,120
You are not allowed to say that you were just

1279
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:36,800
You you can't literally say that about the violent left

1280
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,128
Those things before

1281
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:46,528
He's doing all of those things that is insulting

1282
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:52,928
Personal slapped me in the face with b*******

1283
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:59,328
Cruel

1284
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:05,728
$10,000 to whatever charity

1285
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:15,968
Campaign

1286
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,672
After I fight him

1287
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,128
Aware

1288
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,224
Be aware of yourself as a Nazi

1289
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:54,368
Or at least Alex

1290
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:02,816
That makes me that makes me want to fight I'm going to fight him

1291
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:07,424
Stop my ears weird

1292
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
Goodbye

1293
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
Elevation

1294
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:27,648
Murder happens 60 70 years ago at our expenses go back

1295
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:34,048
Federal Reserve

1296
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:42,240
Now that happened in 1930s

1297
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:48,640
Body of the world

1298
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,176
I got it I got that

1299
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:55,296
It was probably

1300
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:58,880
Now that happened in 1920 19 years ago

1301
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:05,536
62 cylinder years ago

1302
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:10,656
Was it now I remember because they were getting all like I want to have her remember that

1303
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:16,544
Barnes doesn't Barrett

1304
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
Trump needs somebody

1305
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,944
On his side

1306
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,136
This is this

1307
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:36,768
You're being too obvious yeah I'm pretty sure you're saying that what he needs to do is make

1308
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:43,168
Didn't you think you're just in

1309
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:46,240
I don't want a supreme court do not want

1310
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:51,360
Independent exactly what he said

1311
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,896
Yeah

1312
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,456
Amy Coney Barrett

1313
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,648
Supreme Court

1314
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:12,608
It may surprise you to hear this but there is no Pope named the John Pius the 2nd

1315
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,912
There's never even been a John Pius the 1st

1316
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:21,312
I suspect Alex is trying to do is have his brain come up with two different things at the same time

1317
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,872
Beaufort 1978 2005

1318
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:30,016
The other name pie I think comes from Alex's brings religious beliefs

1319
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,344
Controller

1320
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,136
1958

1321
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:41,536
Because the next Pope John the 23rd was notably more Progressive like how he said the Jews aren't evil

1322
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:49,728
Both of these names

1323
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:55,872
And in the process he forgot about the 2013

1324
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,920
I've said this before

1325
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:04,320
Alex naughty details guy

1326
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,904
So I'll accept after Barnsley

1327
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:11,744
Soccer field

1328
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,768
Rihanna

1329
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,424
Don't care

1330
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:25,824
Play Goin Hard on a T-Rex.

1331
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:33,760
This is basically we're going to end

1332
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,064
Really funny cuz it's basically a banana peel

1333
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:39,904
He said it once

1334
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
We want to hear

1335
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,048
Jeffy

1336
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
T-Mobile

1337
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:01,408
Here

1338
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:07,808
I demand they make it there's no man great

1339
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,344
What do we do

1340
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,208
Getting what I want

1341
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:20,608
I can't scare people about

1342
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,728
That's just a smokescreen for when they do make it mandatory right

1343
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:33,408
I don't care boy this little bit

1344
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,200
I feel a little bit

1345
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,504
Reinvigorated I don't know why

1346
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,528
I don't know what it is

1347
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:47,744
I have that nebulizer over there was for a reason

1348
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
Actually

1349
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:55,680
The worm farm is made of

1350
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:02,080
I did know I know

1351
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,640
Take it back by do I retract it alright

1352
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:12,832
So I don't know why I look at these these couple days

1353
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,136
There's just

1354
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:15,904
Deep

1355
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:22,048
Coded and unloaded racism

1356
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,584
It's kind of like come on man

1357
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
This is a little much

1358
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,240
What makes sense

1359
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:36,384
Psycho

1360
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,688
Really justify it to well

1361
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
So

1362
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,736
Best not to try

1363
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:47,136
It's a tragedy.

1364
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,672
To deliver through

1365
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,976
Secondary

1366
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:54,048
Like Tik-Tok videos and stuff like that

1367
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,840
Express your bigotry that way

1368
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,376
Just like everywhere else

1369
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,936
It just always like

1370
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:04,800
If it's a black person it's always well you shouldn't have put yourself in that situation

1371
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,784
Somehow the worst-case scenarios

1372
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:21,184
Dating a drug dealer means that you deserve to die or that your death is any less tragic

1373
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:26,048
Or or cause for concern

1374
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:37,312
Half of our friends have drug dealers

1375
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,872
Well you should have had friends who are comedians

1376
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,720
Hang out with baby

1377
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:10,592

But then I

1394
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
I had to call

Undefeatable

1524
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:34,048
Just blow stuff up left and right looking for a more precise

1525
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:40,448
Use a blast Arrow to pop off the caps at one of those

No idea what's going on with that I probably shouldn't be fine with it

1586
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:56,352
Almost forgot

1587
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,376

02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:03,680
Probably enjoy it a lot more than I would think so

1601
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:12,640
Gifts are specifically for me like the cell service or I feel like a bottle of really nice whiskey is

1602
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:21,344
So I expect a full report on that

1603
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:27,744
To the disembodied Spirit of knock

1604
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:34,912

Terio Canada

1606
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:47,968
I will say this could have easily been a bright spot for me and that was

1607
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,016
Just a box of Canadian candy

1608
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:54,624
I have to say I was pretty impressed

1609
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,952
I went in with some iffy expectation

1610
02:07:58,464 --> 02:07:59,232
Because like

1611
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:05,632

02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:36,352

1617
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:42,752

1623
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,400
It's it's the taste

1624
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:13,984
It's just that fine

1625
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:20,384
Flavor

1626
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,432
Does it even have alcohol

1627
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:26,016
Then what's the point

1628
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:32,416
