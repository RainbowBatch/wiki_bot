00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Need

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody welcome back to knowledge fight like just sit around in a hotel

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
Show rooms in Austin Texas

7
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
We worship Selene from

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Alphardy

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
Saw today

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
What are we

11
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
We do it yes it's a very serious question

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
Get back to this in a second but it was probably

13
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Talk about right spot

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Yes that's a good point Dan

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
Bright spot today but bright spot is

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,184
I was around the

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
The s***

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
Today after going to the trial

19
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Yeah and I wanted some food

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,144
And I've nothing in the hotel room so I ordered jack-in-the-box

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
There's no Jack

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,776
The Box in Chicago now it is something that is beloved of me and my friend

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
True love a jack-in-the-box

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Cuz there was one like on the way to St Louis there wasn't any

25
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Columbia either

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Answer was like is real

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Need to pull over and go to the Jack-in-the-Box

28
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Ghetto

29
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,184
Tacos not good doesn't mean that when the heart

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Wants What It Wants

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Liking garbage

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
But yes I got that I got some

33
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Some of the Jack-in-the-Box tacos

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
They showed up

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Worst

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Worst delivery experience

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,968
There are different

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
Your situation was maybe a little tougher but

39
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
I get the Jack in the Box

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
There's no sauce for the tacos

41
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
I am so I thought

42
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Myself

43
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Going to be disgusting

44
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
They're already

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Disgusting but the sauce makes them

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Edible

47
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
Right

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
The soldier through

49
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
And they were still pretty good

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
So yeah that's my price

51
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
Significant break in the Box tacos were not ruined by being

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Sauceless

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
Give me my bright spot is

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
Boy it's been a long table Kate of s*** for me I've been really enjoying Tweety

55
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Think about the trial live stream

56
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Literally nothing else has been good so far

57
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
I've been hit by a truck. Had to run around this whole f******

58
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
Ringtone for THC

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Soundboard

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
That doesn't even f****** work half the time

61
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,592
All you got

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Because I think people might be

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Confused first of all

64
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
The soundboard issue that

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
What you're talkin about is

66
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,552
We brought a small soundboard

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
With which to

68
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,208
Record and did not realize until we got here that did not have a USB connect

69
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Could plug into the

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,328
The laptop and I couldn't play Clips through it

71
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Now that's going to do a lake

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
We can throw that into Barton Springs

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
In honor of Oz

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Alex this one's for you

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Then

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
You got a replace

77
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
Another one that has a USB connection and we cannot get it to work

78
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
3 hours

79
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Plus

80
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
Earlier trying everything I can figure out to I do it so

81
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
We recordings this here

82
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
But we can't play any clips

83
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Not our fault

84
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
We have to take the blame cuz

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
It's not anybody else's

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
His fault but it is is just bad happen

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
In Stamps Shore

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
And I had a fun episode

89
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Really ready

90
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
Need to go but I guess we just have to ruminate on

91
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
Are serious Austin so far

92
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,103
So you got hit by a truck though

93
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
T-boned

94
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Or like going over

95
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,087
B it was it it was kind of a weird situation we were driving in a f****** Park

96
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Parking lot and my Lyft driver I mean

97
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
My Rideshare driver sure

98
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,511
Absolutely

99
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
In the in the parking lot

100
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,495
And I was not paying attention whatsoever I was like hey I'm happy that this guys moving cuz I've been waiting here for a while

101
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
And then all the sudden I am smart

102
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Passenger side door

103
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Because we got T-boned

104
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Buy a f****** lawnscaping

105
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
What are those

106
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
Huge ass like

107
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
4000

108
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Or whatever they're f******

109
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
I'm called now I feel bad about saying you didn't get Tebow

110
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
I mean he was it was like he was going

111
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
1520 miles an hour

112
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
You know so all I have is a giant lump on my head I didn't have a seer

113
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Concussion about to go to the

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,191
Which you made me you're going to make me feel your head

115
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
I received

116
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
I was going to make

117
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Certainly suggest

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,735
Do you think there's a possibility that this bump on the head is what

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
Is causing you to live tweet

120
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,391
There are so many possible things with the bump on the head

121
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
Could be responsible for supervillains

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Shitposter shorty

123
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
What you hate dad

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Play the path

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
What is a plural noun

126
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
Me what I be Matt Taibbi

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Except

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
We're here we're in Austin

129
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
Danzig

130
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,927
2 Days in on the trial at this point would recording this

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
At midnight

132
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Cuz I couldn't get these recorders to work we're doing great

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,631
Doing so good doing great got it on Sunday

134
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Yep

135
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
Monday was the jury selection

136
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
And we we happy

137
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Thought or the belief was

138
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
Initially that we would be able to go to that

139
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
And hanging out at the courthouse

140
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
But

141
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
We're not able to

142
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
So instead

143
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,599
A bit of that on the the old livestream

144
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
Didn't allow any media into the room during the

145
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
This is what I heard from other

146
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
Media folk right

147
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
The only ones

148
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Not not trying to

149
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Pretend that we press badges or anything

150
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,591
I did put a little sign in my hat fedora

151
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,967
Yeah it was like a little sign on your pump

152
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,879
It's so a little bit to uneventful I think selection is

153
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
Kind of an arduous process there's a lot of repetition

154
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
Yeah kind of get a little bit in

155
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
Insight into some stuff obviously but

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
It's not

157
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
The Flash

158
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Yeah it was interesting to watch

159
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
The jury select

160
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
TuneIn full

161
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
I just

162
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Because it appeared that

163
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
The defense lawyer was absolutely willing to give up

164
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
Every bit of their strategy in every single question

165
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
It was literally like

166
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Hey

167
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
What if I said I want a judgment of $1

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
Who here it was a virgin auction like

169
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
That's what everybody's maximum amount would be

170
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
Obviously

171
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Seems like a question should be able to ask

172
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Yeah that's that went on Monday

173
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Let me ask you this when you were watching

174
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Specific

175
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Did you find yourself poem

176
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
For any jurors

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
Like honestly really for them to be on the jury but

178
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
Absolutely

179
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Play there were a few

180
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
You people who gave

181
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
I'd like

182
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
I mean

183
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Gave responses

184
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
That were impassioned

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
We're empathetic

186
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
We're caring

187
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,591
And where the absolute wrong thing to say if you ever wanted to be on this f****** jury

188
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
In your life you know

189
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Like somebody was

190
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Describing restored

191
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Justice almost

192
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,831
And it was listening to that I was like you're gone by

193
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Get out of here you know

194
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Yeah yeah

195
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
I think that kind of fun cuz you couldn't really see

196
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
See the people until you just had their words

197
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Yes judge on

198
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
Face of a lawyer unhappy

199
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
It's like the dating game

200
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,847
Do you know where you'd have Bachelor number 1 2 and 3 behind the screen

201
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Juror number one

202
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
I would have preferred a game of guess who where we could have just

203
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,063
Slapped off the people who'll be

204
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
No glass

205
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Is your door wearing a

206
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
That's me

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
So close

208
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
BBQ

209
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
How to get to barbecue which was

210
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
Find that was my first and last food in the past 3 days

211
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,103
Heather on the other hand

212
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Jack in the Box tacos

213
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
Barbecue I got some donuts tomorrow morning

214
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
You're doing better than me but I think I could outrun

215
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
This is the best I can

216
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
You can run

217
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
That's good enough

218
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
So yeah

219
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Today

220
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
Was the beginning at the open

221
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Little bit of

222
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Eyewitness

223
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
This time how did you feel about Mark's open

224
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
Yeah I thought so

225
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
I mean look here's the thing

226
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
When you talk about the opening

227
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Segment

228
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
That were made in this

229
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
This case

230
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
I think you got to look at both of them at the same time

231
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Because I pay

232
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
Obviously you could just say that Mark

233
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Opening statement was good

234
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
In order to understand why it was good

235
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
You really are

236
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Have to look at the other one which was not good

237
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
Amazing Alex's lawyers opening statement was not good

238
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
I'm at work

239
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
Reasons why is first was kind of Meandering

240
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
It wasn't very well delivered

241
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Mark had a

242
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Sincerity behind what he was saying a pesos

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
But

244
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
More than that

245
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
There was a narc

246
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Yes there was

247
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Is a

248
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
Story essentially of like

249
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
Here are relevant pieces of information that fit into

250
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
What happened

251
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
Right and that was really missing from the defense

252
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Open

253
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
Opening statement which was just kind of like

254
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,823
Apologize

255
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
1 this is an Alex's fault

256
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
Even if he did say he did it and we heard him do it

257
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
2

258
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
I know you saw those videos but he did next

259
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Say that yeah

260
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Three come on he apologized that does

261
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159
Doesn't count and for its again everybody else's fault but Alex

262
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Sue them

263
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,511
Opening

264
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,631
It certainly included for the defense was the notion of you got to watch the video

265
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Oh yeah

266
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
That came up a couple times

267
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Conflicted relation

268
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Chip with that because

269
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
I do think you do need to generally

270
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
But you might have to

271
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
A lot of times

272
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
There aren't there

273
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
What is context it's amazing

274
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
From

275
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Short section

276
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
The video

277
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
You are Alex

278
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,879
And you demand people watch whole videos

279
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,743
No one has the time in their life to do it now and if that's the standard of being able

280
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
The judge Alex's intentions

281
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
Like nobody except me you would be qualified

282
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
To have an opinion on what

283
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
You did right

284
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Maybe that's true

285
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Which means

286
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
That yours is the only opinion that counts

287
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,199
I think we've already established a lot but you understand someone would just come back to me with like all you didn't watch this

288
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Standard of something that you're missing

289
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Emancipet

290
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
That's difficult

291
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Because I think some people

292
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Can be done Dirty by

293
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
Selective attention

294
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Cherry picking

295
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Wingstop

296
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
I think that's the case

297
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
At all not just that

298
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Button

299
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Mark's opening

300
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
He played a clip

301
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
We're Infowars clearly

302
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
Edited versions of

303
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
Clips together

304
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Deceptively

305
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
To avoid playing the full clip

306
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
So Alex

307
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Is

308
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,271
Guilty of the things that he blames everybody else or not

309
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,135
Well thank that clip that you're talking about is the one where Owen Shroyer is

310
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Talking

311
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,023
About mr. hassling

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Two clamps

313
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
One of dr. Wayne Carver and one of one of the other parents

314
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
And they are edited in such a way as to make it a

315
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
The pier that they're saying

316
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
But they didn't see the kids and there's no what right right

317
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
I'm so

318
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
The issues

319
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,223
I don't think anybody can demonstrate that Infowars edited those video

320
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
They may have come in house

321
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
Deceptively edited

322
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
It's still their fault for not finding out what the context is

323
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
But yeah maybe they didn't do it then

324
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,095
Make the videos but if you're the ones who play it on Infowars

325
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
While saying that everybody else needs 200 full clip

326
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Yeah

327
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Point stands just wanted to

328
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Clarification

329
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm talking legalese now so we showed up prior

330
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
To these these

331
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Opening statements and I had a nice

332
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
The front row

333
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Reserved

334
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
You have to go to the bank

335
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Because I am a bad boy

336
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
The sound a little bit

337
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,703
The first thing that happened when I sat down to the back after Alex walked in

338
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
Well I was going to get to the hell okay thanks for ruining the dramatic reveal

339
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
No cir so I sat down

340
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
I sitting next to Sebastian Murdock

341
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,551
I was there very very nice to meet him

342
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Do just do it there's this

343
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Beard Buzz of like

344
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:56,255
Is Alex going to show up right cuz he wasn't there yet wasn't there on Monday exactly it played sick

345
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
Yeah it was something

346
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,327
And

347
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,143
Just kind of a a feeling in the air of

348
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Is it going to show up

349
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
My conjecture had been

350
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,847
Just you and I talked to Robert about it a little bit on the episode that we did

351
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
Alex was going to show up

352
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
And he was going to make it

353
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
He's going to be a dick

354
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Outside the courtroom cuz he couldn't behave

355
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Like a dick inside the court

356
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Correct

357
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
That was kind of my theory if

358
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
He did show up

359
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
But we didn't know he was going

360
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
Until we're there were hanging out

361
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,023
Habitat power business

362
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
NYX Alexander

363
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,751
Gross shalaby f****** jacket The Man based on his appear

364
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Do you need something

365
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
I'm insulting him based upon respect

366
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Bright bright

367
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Look better than

368
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Not good now I sweat through a shirt

369
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
That wasn't very attractive at all

370
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
I don't have respect for

371
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
4 quarts so that's fine with me

372
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,927
Yes that's in a position where you have to

373
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
Wear an undershirt

374
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Alex walked in

375
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
I was in the depositions I've been in a room with him

376
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Before right

377
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
And

378
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,543
I I don't know what it was like for you to experience him in the

379
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
The Flash for the first time

380
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
You know it was

381
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
It was

382
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,943
Very similar to what you described

383
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
When you met him for the first time

384
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Which was

385
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Like

386
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
1

387
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
You should know who I am

388
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
I'm sure I know I know

389
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
When to

390
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Boy this is

391
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Really that's

392
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Yeah you are a disappointing motherfuker

393
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,143
You know what was super weird

394
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,727
I'm surprised by how little the atmosphere in the room change

395
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
When he came in

396
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
You know like I really doubt there was a part of me that expected like

397
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
This Electric

398
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Thing was going to come in and bright

399
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
I was I was just kind of a dude is way too much

400
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Security

401
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Security

402
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
6 total

403
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Is bunch

404
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
And outside well after you would laugh

405
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
Alex was doing a little bit of a small press conference that said he had some other security guards she's one of them

406
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
May have had a fake must

407
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
What is unclear

408
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:18,591
Earlier in the day

409
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Alex shows up

410
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,503
Beyond just like the atmosphere of the room not really changing and if

411
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
You showed up what about that

412
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
Beyond that the other thing that I was

413
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Really struck

414
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
By was

415
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
How

416
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Few people were there

417
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
Really not many people I say this

418
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
I say this at risk

419
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Of sounding

420
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
Conceited

421
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
I think there were more knowledge fight fans there than out

422
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
There were

423
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,919
Three or four people who came up to us and thank you for saying hello it's nice to meet you

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
We're not here in any official capacity

425
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
I didn't see anybody

426
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
He who like

427
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,303
Appeared to be someone I would recognize from Infowars world

428
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
Like one of the other reporters

429
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Like

430
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
He had

431
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
He could have just had like Harrison

432
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,591
Smith Wait out of the hall or Savannah Hernandez it maybe do an interview or something Harrison has to wait

433
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
Car windows rolled up

434
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
If he lives if he lives if he dies he dies

435
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
That's Alex's snake-handling

436
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
It was it was

437
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Not

438
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Pact

439
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
Really at all

440
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
And that was surprised me a little bit

441
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
I thought that

442
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
I mean

443
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
I don't know what I

444
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,703
I thought but I figured Alex would have some kind of a fan face

445
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
First off the first thing that we thought was

446
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
Get there early cuz we don't know if there's going to be enough room

447
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
What you know there was

448
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Led to your room

449
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Now

450
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
A lot of people were like

451
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,575
Taking up more space Maybe than they were some people like

452
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
At least a few people with

453
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,207
Equipment yeah I like cameras or what have you sound like

454
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
That takes up more than once

455
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
But yeah yeah

456
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
I was baffled by that

457
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
I think that's sad for him

458
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,895
I don't know maybe he maybe he would actively not want any of his fans in the courtroom on

459
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
My account

460
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
All the truth

461
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
That he's not allowed to lie about

462
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
Well pennies he doesn't have to talk

463
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
You know he's not like

464
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
You think he's going to be up on the

465
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Fast and hitting getting

466
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Debased

467
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
Or anything but I think

468
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
I have two minds about it

469
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
One is a dink

470
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,351
If I were him I probably wouldn't want

471
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
My listeners there either

472
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Not necessarily cuz what they would be

473
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Be exposed to

474
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Because

475
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Wiggle around

476
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Because of like

477
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
You know that

478
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
They're going to not

479
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Be cool

480
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
You know like they're not going to be people you want to meet

481
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Probably Brown

482
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,319
For people who like him

483
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
They're probably going

484
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
To Yellow

485
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
1776 on the court

486
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
100% And that would be

487
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Bad

488
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,535
I guess my mind is

489
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,583
Maybe that would be good

490
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Maybe they'll be what you'd want disruptive

491
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Entirely

492
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
And have somebody else do it that you want

493
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Take responsibility

494
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
That's true

495
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Do you know

496
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
I guess

497
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,407
Although that may really Prejudice the jury against you if one of your fans

498
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Bust out

499
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
Just going

500
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,527
I think if I were on a jury I'd be like

501
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Bad guys bad guy

502
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,647
It's me if I was on a jury

503
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
That

504
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
This person is very

505
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Believes

506
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
In America

507
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,351
That's what I read in their followers

508
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
But yes yeah

509
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
Opening statements like I said I think we agree on this

510
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
One good one bad

511
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
It reminds me of relative

512
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
You know how if you're both

513
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
To the speed of light

514
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Time moves slower so you know if

515
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
You go out at a million

516
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
The light-year away

517
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
You know I meant come back

518
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
Everybody you know is two years older

519
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
And you're still the same age really

520
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Right

521
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,048
That is similar to the opening

522
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
Mark went to f******

523
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
Andromeda Galaxy

524
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
And this dude Doug himself like

525
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,080
PowerPoint presentation with some clips and contacts and all this

526
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,688
Alex's lawyer head like a board to write on

527
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
Psychopathic

528
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
They wrote slowly on

529
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
Excruciating and most of it was really just

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Like

531
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Here is a stretch of time

532
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
And then

533
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Sixteen-year-old emeritus

534
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Hillary

535
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Are we here

536
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah but here's a really bum meow

537
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
So when we got in

538
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
Decorum initially

539
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
There were

540
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Some props

541
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
Alex's lawyers

542
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Had some profit

543
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
Right in the gate

544
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
One of them was a board

545
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,040
That said something to the effect of like

546
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Infowars coverage of Sandy Hook

547
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
Cuz 1/5 of 1% of

548
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,720
They're covered in then there was another thing

549
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
That was like

550
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
I think it was

551
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,352
Going to be velcroed onto the big board

552
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Find glass in order to demonstrate the

553
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,336
Unveiled because I was sitting in the background

554
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:42,944
Is baby allowed in court

555
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,808
So I didn't get to know what those this was excluded

556
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Did as being something that could be presented

557
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
I think for a number

558
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
1

559
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,488
Jackie

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,144
I understand it it was not like if you're going to say that you have to be able to demonstrate right can't demonstrate the

561
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
If it was

562
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
One-half of 1%

563
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
But here's why I'm pissed off about

564
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
I wanted

565
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
I wanted those Pro

566
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Got they would have been

567
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Chicago though

568
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
The judge needed to disqualify those

569
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:27,744
This is a courtroom in real life

570
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
But

571
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,816
I mean those are not going to help.

572
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Defense

573
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Big Board

574
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,168
That they had the big sign

575
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
That I did get

576
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
To see a little bit of Vic

577
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,592
Cuz they was unveiled Prix

578
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
And it basically looks like the McDonald's like

579
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
Over 500,000 hours sold

580
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,480
Like

581
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Kind of thing

582
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
To make a big deal of like

583
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
He does a ton of content and this much was about San Diego

584
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Right

585
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
I've been alive

586
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
Like a million hours

587
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Only two of them I spent murdering

588
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Yeah

589
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,752
All about you

590
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
I want those

591
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
I got to find

592
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,712
Tomorrow morning we're going to I'm going back to the courthouse

593
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,040
Figure out the sound

594
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Go to the courthouse

595
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
I'm trying to find their dumpster

596
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
See if it's in there man

597
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
In the courthouse. What else would they do with it

598
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,936
We're going to throw a soundboard right next to it everything like

599
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Marc's

600
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,544
Car is in there the 10

601
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
Fake mustaches in there

602
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Oh God

603
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
The opening

604
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Statements

605
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Go down

606
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,808
Queendom there's a recess

607
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
And

608
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
We all everybody exit

609
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
The court Alex goes out before

610
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,792
And as we're exiting

611
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
You can see that a little ways down the hallway

612
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Which is the only way to

613
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,240
To leave this courtroom Alex's posted up in front of

614
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
Some cameras is yelling about how he got jacked up

615
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Now

616
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Jordan

617
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Ever the

618
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,504
Besides you decided that you wanted to interfere

619
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,344
Yeah I was just listening to this

620
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,672
Bulshit and watching these people in a courtroom protect

621
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Him

622
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
And his ability to say nonsense

623
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,304
On camera

624
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,632
Child be allowed to bear

625
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
They're going to come get me

626
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,472
Play I need to yell at

627
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Motherfuker

628
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Sure

629
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
So instantly

630
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
After I said something

631
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
The court officer

632
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,712
Just walks up to me get the right in front of my face real close and goes

633
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
And it's like f*** you

634
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,600
Will do whatever I don't think it was that intimidating

635
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Are there

636
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Ocean

637
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Is intimidating

638
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Because you are trying to make it time

639
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
Think that I I I see both sides of this

640
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
I get where you're coming from and I think

641
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Scale

642
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
But in the desert of the individual like

643
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Actual real world of it

644
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,456
Like we're there it's a disrespect to the court what

645
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
He's doing

646
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
And you'd be adding to it

647
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
If you

648
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
You yelled at him so I'm glad that I'm glad that

649
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Calmer heads prevailed

650
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
Myself strategy worked

651
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
Which was behind him

652
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,912
Until you're there

653
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,752
On Fox 7 right

654
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,872
Insert myself in some entirely where's Waldo ass

655
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,992
In the background photobomb his business conference

656
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
And so are you know if Alex watches himself on the news he's not going to see me behind that works

657
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Okay

658
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
The shots

659
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
I watched a little bit of that

660
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
We were both

661
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,608
Well I will tell you this my mice

662
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,144
Sweaty pits

663
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
Prominently featured and it many

664
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
I also got sidetracked with

665
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Bill walked by

666
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
A reporter at Matt's

667
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Price of

668
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,760
A lot of lot of Halo

669
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
That happens

670
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
And

671
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
I thought

672
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,648
For sure Alex's

673
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
I thought like okay he's done his

674
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
He's going to leave

675
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Right

676
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,304
He ended up staying

677
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
For his own opening

678
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Safe mode

679
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
And

680
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
The judge

681
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
110

682
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
About doing

683
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,616
What he had done in the hallway

684
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
Rightfully and maybe

685
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
A little late

686
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
Toward maybe I should have been immediate

687
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:11,904
I'm not going to be late is the story of this trial

688
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Well

689
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
You know I

690
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
I think what you're dealing with somebody like Alex

691
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
You got to give as many benefits

692
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Served out as you can

693
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Because

694
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,400
The argument is always going to be there

695
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
You jammed this person up

696
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,544
And you got to cover all your bases to make sure that those things are

697
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
Flimsy appearances that could be knocked out

698
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Super easily

699
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,016
But I think that if your zodiac is like some kind of an awareness about Alex operate

700
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,160
You can't do many press conferences would have been like ground-rule I mean we're on

701
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,232
Year what now he did that during his like

702
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,280
Custody hearing

703
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
This is what he does

704
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Anyway not be allowed to give an a

705
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Prompto press

706
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Front outside lights.

707
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
If he's going to be a giant

708
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
I think I should be allowed to do as well

709
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
Was basically told to leave work

710
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
Not like I'm going to leave I'm too sweaty

711
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
Man extreme anxiety is not fun

712
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,952
Realizing that weed isn't legal here until you get here

713
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,792
Yeah it is it is weird to have extreme anxiety and

714
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Treated it

715
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
Successfully with

716
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
THC for a few years

717
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
And then just all of a sudden people are like

718
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Know your meds are illegal

719
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
Like oh

720
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
Okay

721
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
I guess I'm just going to sweat my balls off in this

722
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Courtroom

723
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
Somebody about how I know it sucks

724
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
Weed illegal here

725
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
Chicago

726
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,024
Here too if you know someone

727
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,584
Or if you go get Delta Ancient Man

728
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,704
I've been doing THC for too long to believe that Delta Liu

729
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
Suck down an entire Vape cartridge

730
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Delta 8

731
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,336
And I was part of your sweater

732
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
No no no that was

733
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
004

734
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:17,856
And told a cut it out with this b******* shenanigans

735
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
And

736
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
I regretted Maybe

737
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Spain

738
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
Before the 2nd

739
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,608
In part because that guy is opening

740
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
It was pretty boring

741
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
To come back

742
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,056
Come back to the hotel to do some work and watch the

743
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
The stream from here

744
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
And you missed out on me

745
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,944
You had already left

746
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,480
And out

747
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Side

748
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
Outside of the courtroom

749
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Alex showed up

750
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Outside

751
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
Write in order to do another minipress.

752
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
Because you told me he was totally can't do one in the room

753
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,840
And so he did it out in front of the courthouse

754
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:05,728
And he put on that like Infowars bumper sticker over his mouth wow then just took it off

755
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,544
Basically when he realized that there was nobody out there

756
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,176
There was nobody what a message he had no fans hanging out

757
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
There was no press

758
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
Here's what the Press was

759
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
You had

760
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,576
Sebastian

761
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Georgia Post

762
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,672
You have Liz Williamson from The New York Times and then by the Bennett

763
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,560
More security guards than there were press and fans combined

764
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
True it was

765
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
So sad

766
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
Because Alex was holding his is like little thing you could

767
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
I was watching from afar

768
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
And I could tell that he was doing his

769
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
They will not let me defend myself right then he realized

770
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
The reporters were people

771
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
A little bit of a

772
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,880
So then he posed with his lawyer with a bumper sticker over his mouth

773
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
God

774
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Pathetic loser

775
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,304
Yeah that he took off that stuff it was

776
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Hilarious to watch

777
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Because there was such

778
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Impotent

779
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,448
Showmanship

780
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
Who's the showman without a crowd

781
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
That

782
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Was fun

783
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
Got it somebody had played

784
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
The curb themes

785
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
Songwriter

786
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,504
That was what I was saying I wanted to do instead of

787
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,368
Yelling at Alex was just put on the Cantina theme from Star Wars and dance around

788
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,048
Just dance around behind him

789
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Oh my God

790
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Yeah

791
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
I think I

792
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
I thought there was something really sad about that

793
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Yeah but then

794
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
It kind of hit me that

795
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
You know that electric

796
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
That you didn't

797
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Winfield when he walked in

798
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
Into the room

799
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
I know.

800
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Splits

801
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
You could kind of get a little bit of that sense

802
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
When he was in front of those key

803
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
Yeah there was there

804
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
It wasn't

805
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
The vibe in the room didn't change

806
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Because he didn't

807
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
Turn himself on

808
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,352
Yeah like he can just turn himself on

809
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,680
Randolph and whatever if you just

810
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,728
I'm here I'm just catatonic

811
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,752
Or whatever

812
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
He's a vile mean

813
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
After the I don't know you couldn't

814
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
You couldn't see this be

815
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,384
Because you left

816
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
The courtroom

817
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,432
But on the feet

818
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
After the opening

819
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,344
Sing the lawyer essentially said you know

820
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
I think we've got half the jury

821
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Because he's amor

822
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Sure and then

823
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
And then well I listen to him talk

824
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
You decide

825
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
And then Alex

826
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
He wasn't optimistic those props were going to fly

827
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
That's true

828
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
I meant Alex looks directly at the feed camera

829
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
And then

830
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Gives it

831
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Finger guns

832
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Straight up

833
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Double finger guns and laughing

834
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Like

835
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,784
Wow I feel like if it wasn't Alex Jones and it wasn't in a courtroom

836
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
I could kind of dig that

837
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
Yeah I wouldn't I would have appreciated it more if he had done that to the judge but I think that would have gotten him a charge now let me sink

838
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,864
Now what

839
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Yeah

840
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,264
Yeah from what I understand from what you were saying that there was a bit in

841
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
A bit of things

842
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,384
You can see in the feed cuz they didn't realize that their mic was on

843
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,272
We're still on because you can hear half of what they were talking about hopefully not anything like important strategy-wise

844
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,112
I mean there were some things where if you

845
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Really

846
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Dug-in in like tried to

847
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
The catch

848
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
Cuz you can hear just like little bit

849
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Bits and pieces of

850
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
And there they were

851
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
Some things where you're where I really did think that

852
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
I don't think they want this

853
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
To be public

854
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,960
Brunswick they want this on the street

855
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,896
Transitory feel about that to that cuz you're not allowed

856
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
How to record

857
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,272
Any of that stuff ever have clips of the

858
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
Anything

859
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
Yeah

860
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
It's 1 in the morning

861
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,440
Now

862
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
Because I was

863
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Sort of

864
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Ballpark

865
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Working it when I said

866
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,168
We have to get to the courthouse tomorrow morning

867
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
And I'm excited about that

868
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
That would be more witnesses and I think they three is going to be

869
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
No more interesting

870
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Victim

871
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Alex probably won't be the

872
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
And I think that'll create less of a like

873
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Severe discount

874
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Well the judge

875
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:41,440
And the lawyers were were very clear that Rob is supposed

876
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
To be there tomorrow

877
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Well-liked

878
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:49,888
He is supposed to be that we will see if they will do as you

879
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
If so

880
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
I hope he's wearing his Kangol hat

881
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,592
Yes I wonder how tall he is in person

882
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,408
I wonder if the room changes when do

883
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,944
What is do it like

884
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,528
You don't know it but he has like

885
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Just just

886
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
Animal magnetism like everybody's

887
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Music holy

888
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Watch out this is like a young built

889
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
Quinton walking into the room he can

890
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,584
Breaks out of snacks

891
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
Search wailing on

892
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
Hopefully you get this audio fixed

893
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Because

894
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
I would I would like

895
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
To be able to place

896
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Some clips we're going to do our best

897
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
I don't feel like we're at our strongest when we're

898
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Just relaying

899
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
We're we're having

900
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
We are left

901
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Stat just relaying

902
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,928
Until I think it feels a little bit different since but I'm

903
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,256
Which is not to say that Clips are any sort of

904
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,024
Crocheting

905
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
So much as it is

906
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,584
We're just not practical

907
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
100 episodes in yunos kind of have a have a rhythm have some things that are you stupid

908
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
I think the audience has become a

909
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Custom to I agree

910
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
And they'll be back

911
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
But yeah

912
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,176
You have any any other thoughts about today

913
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,784
Experience thus far I will tell I will tell one story that

914
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,624
When Alex walked into the courtroom and its security.

915
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
Detail followed

916
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah yeah

917
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,464
Two of them went and stood at the

918
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
The back of the room

919
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,072
Right next to me where I was sitting in the what I'll call up

920
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
And

921
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,752
I looked over and I saw their their earpieces and I was like

922
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
Oh my God are you guys out

923
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
Security detail do you want to sit next to me

924
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
They did not respond

925
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,456
And then went and sat over on the other side and just started

926
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Talking amongst

927
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Themselves that every now and again look

928
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
Looking back at me like I was a threat

929
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Very scared

930
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:52,512
Is not happy about it you are sweating so much trouble already

931
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
Where I'm not supposed to be unless I'm going to go to

932
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Jail that's the way I feel

933
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:59,168
Think of it usually why people are there

934
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
So in my head I was already

935
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,800
Going to be accidentally convicted of Alex's crimes

936
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
And then

937
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,664
Former Blackwater motherfukers like

938
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,480
Former Blackwater

939
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,344
The house is fun but that idea that you like

940
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Man

941
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
I screw up

942
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
This is all going to be about me

943
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Pictures of elaborate trap

944
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,424
To God it is nice to think that I'm

945
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
Jordan you're so ridiculous

946
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240

951
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
We have a lot

952
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:53,440
To enjoy over the coming days in a week

953
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
There'll be episodes

954
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,096
Probably more regularly than normal but also

955
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
I don't want to

956
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
It all depends on how good you are

957
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,496
I know it's on his way

958
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264

959
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312

963
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
He struck out

964
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
Brutal but we have

965
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,160
Glenn Greenwald and Alex Jones doing Q&A

966
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,976

974
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
I feel like

975
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
From a monetary perspective that might be worth it for

976
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,952
Several hundreds of millions of dollars

977
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
Depending on the judge

978
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792

00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
