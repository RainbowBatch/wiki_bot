00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,104
As a replacement California

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
Madrag

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Hello welcome back to the show

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
Thank you it's been awhile it's good to have you learned anything about Alex

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,696
Just stuff it's been in the news I remember

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Michelle

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
But I know a lot about Alex Jones you still know very little about him

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:41,728
Don't know if I told you every time I usually leaves

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
This time might be no different

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,432
That is something that is one of the listener sometimes

13
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
I like the show but this is depressing

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
I know

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Sorry

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:01,440
It's not so much he's just in the van like a Rush Limbaugh or whatever just

17
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
A character spell announcer

18
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
Since we can make money today more there are out there that believe like I knew a guy that

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
And there's no conspiracy

20
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
Diaper

21
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,384
But a fluoride

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Staffing hadwin

23
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
For your mind

24
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Okay you can have it

25
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,368
It's something that I struggle with

26
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
But you know you got to keep moving forward

27
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,072
I think I think that there is plenty of stuff that's at least

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
I can't make an argument.

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Fun at all

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah you do a lot of the older I get the more I'm kind of like I'll just find them

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
My little pillow and whatever is going on and just

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Until I die

33
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
Sure

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
So whatever whenever the ship comes take a nap and go out with the world

35
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Whatever is fine.

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112

I will say that

42
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
I had a thought

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,592

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
I don't know if you do know I just guess I had some

53
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
I don't think so

54
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Never met

00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832

Conociendo last weekend

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
I usually try and move on to a note

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752

But there's nothing important news that it come out that it

64
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,552
I think it's relevant

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
How much is he still talking about yeah

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280

Fizzy water that's fine

73
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,248
A hundred percent

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,600
Daniels will not come up

75
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
What have you

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,256
He did make a video that came out on Saturday over the weekend

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
Turning on Trump

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
Because he signed the Omnibus spending Bill everybody being like

79
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
Alright

80
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
The Fox News Andy

00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
I appreciate

82
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Any glimpse

83
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Love reality.

84
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
Those people want to shall I was like

85
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,719
When troubles like later

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Eddie's like if Obama said that

87
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,911
Why have you not heard every person say that for the last year-and-a-half

88
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Alex I take on that was that it's a Machiavelli and trying to lure people into the open in order to

89
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Gun registration

90
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Gun laws

91
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
These guys are good

92
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
They're pretty good yeah

93
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
The ability to do backflips

94
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
With reality

95
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,183
But you know what it is review might also have someone pitching impression

96
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Like it with the comedy show

97
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
From today's show that says show some of that

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
The games I play

99
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
Apologizing

100
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Yeah that's

101
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,855
Do it we just like the catalog every time you break that is Bernie Sanders impression very important

102
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Big news that happened on Thursday and that's why the Friday show sort of important cover

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Sweetwater

104
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,375
That's that it might be

105
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Just your perception

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
Are you a beast

107
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
What happened on Thursday the most

108
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Important is that they announce

109
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,711
The HR McMaster was going

110
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
He's going to be replaced

111
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
John Bolton

112
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Big Red

113
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Flag for Alex

114
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
This should be a very like I'm out kind of moment

115
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
Because John Bolton is a

116
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Notorious

117
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,095
He is someone who is very in favor of the Iraq someone who

118
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Intelligent

119
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
He's also still in favor of the Iraq War

120
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
Very publicly made the argument that

121
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,199
The problem was we didn't stay there long enough we weren't aggressive enough

122
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Yet his

123
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
His president

124
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,623
Give me Donald Trump

125
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Is that there's an article in the intercept

126
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Just came out

127
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
On Friday as well.

128
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Who started the break

129
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
It's disgusting

130
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
John Bolton 8 months ago gave a speech

131
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
To a group of Iranian exile

132
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
People

133
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Call Dee people's mujahideen

134
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Mainly John Bolton

135
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
Viable alternative

136
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
To the regime

137
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
That is in power in Iran

138
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
And

139
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Basically

140
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,839
The eridian revolution

141
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
Ayatollah Khomeini Revolution

142
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
1979 will not last till its 40th birthday

143
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Which would be

144
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
The beginning of 20

145
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,639
Telling this separatist group

146
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
Working-out topple that by the end of 2018

147
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,879
So Alex should be thrilled with any of that you should be very against

148
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
And now we have someone

149
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Security advisor

150
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Clearly in favor of war with Iran

151
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Among other places

152
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Sin City is great

153
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
Water roller coaster Park Tycoon

154
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Sure surprised

155
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,087
John Bolton

156
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Cuz they're all just b*******

157
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,767
We got Rodger Stone popping in to give us his take

158
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,119
On Donald Trump's New National Security advisor

159
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Mister

160
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Bolton

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
A lot of people really don't like including

162
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
The word is on Bolton

163
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
Interstate Department in the UN in the Pentagon

164
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,231
And that he will be a nap or a

165
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Cool

166
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Munchkin

167
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Edwards

168
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
The carryout

169
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
Policies that the president wants carried out

170
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
He won't sit there and information

171
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Cool cool cool

172
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
So this is Rodger Stone telling Alex

173
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
All right here's the talking point

174
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
When will people realize that the person leaking the information

175
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Is the guy that

176
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Some of the country of

177
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,999
He's the one that's he can't stop telling his friends everything and that's how the information together now

178
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
That might that might be part of the game

179
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,383
Exactly there'll be it'll be sort of Palace intrigue

180
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
Not games being played instead of important issues

181
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
You'll notice Alex uses the word ratchet

182
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
I don't know what that means

183
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
It's just a function area

184
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
I use you as a

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:12,607
Instrument of my will and it's only interesting because it's a word

186
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
Use of that later when talking with Rodger Stone

187
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
That's a Rodger Stone words just repeating

188
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,871
Use people that way like

189
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Bring people that have

190
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
To use them

191
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Is there a

192
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,503
Apple ratchet ratchet

193
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
Sure

194
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Knox

195
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
Blissfully

196
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
Obtuse

197
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Oh wait

198
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
Jesus Britney's bring this guy in at 2 to

199
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
You know get

200
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
He's sleeping.

201
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
You're bringing a John Bolton

202
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
McMaster

203
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Isalita

204
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
He's leaking stuff

205
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
Explain

206
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
On

207
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
Congratulate

208
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
And then Trump

209
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
President again

210
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Some people

211
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
Call the Communist Chinese

212
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
Is appointed by the Communist party and now for lot in life

213
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
By the politburo

214
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
So

215
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Tired of the lies

216
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
Is not addictive

217
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
I love strong man

218
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:30,079
What do you mean about food

219
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,663
I do not believe so

220
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,551
Well in our 2015 investigation into why Alex join team Trump

221
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Concurrent

222
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Very strong pro-putin Santana

223
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,791
Quite a while

224
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
Hate him saying that

225
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Congratulate

226
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Privately

227
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
But also that was in 20

228
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,151
12 different time

229
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Hacking election

230
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
The Game of Life

231
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,255
Hey why didn't you call the Chinese guy dictator like that a point the finger at bankwell

232
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
We could do that

233
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
We can say that

234
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Sure

235
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
Point

236
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
That's right

237
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Jai

238
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Sneezing

239
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
I'm not that involved

240
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
In this next clip

241
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,575
You are a little bit.

242
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
But

243
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,719
Jordan

244
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
It is a boy

245
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
We're now we're going to get to something

246
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
Does a little more familiar

247
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Is mad about him,

248
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
Spell because

249
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,871
He thinks that they're coming at him inappropriately

250
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
What you think about it

251
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
There's been an attack

252
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Why

253
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
And the main

254
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,815
Mint represent

255
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
Impersonal

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
Thomas middleditch

257
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
Middleditch

258
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,759
Cover of the magazine

259
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Okay

260
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Covers

261
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:12,127
Because he believes it has to do with making it cool

262
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
As he would say

263
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
Thomas middleditch

264
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,783
Made fun of that idea

265
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,231
More about this weekend leave that aside for now unless you have any immediate responses

266
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,791
Well I just know he's very anti Jordan klepper

267
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Some of that

268
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
He doesn't like being made fun of

269
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
He's a little bit of a little sensitive

270
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,663
What's interesting to me that I find Most Fascinating is that whenever he gets made fun of

271
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,527
He creates a fake version of what people are making fun of and then gets mad about that

272
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Instead of like

273
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
You hurt my feelings

274
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Which is really what he's saying

275
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
There's a

276
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
A child

277
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Intuit

278
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Do you think Thomas middleditch has a fake name

279
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
No I don't

280
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
IMDb

281
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Thomas middleditch

282
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,431
I know that he came up in Chicago that was his name when he was here

283
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
For he was on

284
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
TV

285
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
I don't know

286
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
I got two strong

287
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Feeling that that maybe

288
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
Are the neighbors actually

289
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Chicago

290
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
Dan Friesen

291
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Jordan

292
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,055
I think we have an aversion to b******* Alex's pretty pretty

293
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
He's one of the larger voices of b*******

294
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Jordan klepper

295
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
Exactly

296
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Some of the people that your mock

297
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,511
I think any of those types

298
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Shows are you know with the satire that they're doing

299
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,887
Some of it's been real

300
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,471
So

301
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
I think there's some pieces that hit

302
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Some babe

303
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Kind of missed the point

304
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,967
Generally I don't know if there's enough

305
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
To make a show out of

306
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Yeah necessarily without getting a little

307
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,927
Cuz some of the pieces that I've seen that have been posted as you

308
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
YouTube videos

309
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
I like yeah right

310
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
I do I get the game

311
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
What's going on

312
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Can make fun of him yelling a bit

313
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,935
I think too that you open up the possibility of

314
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Like playing into his hands

315
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
The tiny bit

316
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Okay because when you have a dedicated

317
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Show on Comedy Central this about him

318
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
He's got to be like

319
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
They're dedicating

320
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,527
Millions of dollars to attack

321
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Sure that sort of thing

322
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
There's a complicated

323
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,535
There's a weird way that Alex's brain works that I think a lot of people don't understand

324
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
I think

325
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
The most

326
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
Scathing attack that can come from hell at him

327
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Is from

328
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,287
A bedroom there frankly I think that's cuz we don't have any

329
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,103
Don't have Comedy Central.

330
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
No Soros money or anything like that is just

331
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
Play Hold on I I was told I was getting a check for

332
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
From George Soros

333
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Colorado

334
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,695
Check the Foreman grill

335
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,023
Secure package

336
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
4 minutes

337
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
I take a grill

338
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Get all the juices out of my meat

339
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Yeah

340
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,031
We get in the next clip

341
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
We get a little bit more insight into the bolt

342
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Narrative

343
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Bad receive

344
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
I clearly that it's coming from Rodger Stone

345
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
Rodger Stones relationship

346
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
What what about Rodger

347
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
We'll get to that in a minute

348
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Rodger Stones friends with

349
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
Senior National Security advisor

350
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Whiskey and play poker together for

351
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
30 years

352
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,055
He says Bolton is an apple

353
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,223
People follow Trump's orders and will not leak in his dog light is loyalty

354
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
The present

355
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,975
I spell apparatchiks

356
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Not even close I don't believe now

357
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
He has a guy on Francis Boyle

358
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
The professor

359
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Just keeps repeating Rodger

360
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Gaston kind of line

361
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,407
How we both don't like Hillary

362
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
But then

363
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,087
You have you have this Rodger says he's an apparatchik

364
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,183
Just get back to you like all those were the narratives coming from

365
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
What's up

366
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Apparatchiks

367
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Oh

368
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Interesting

369
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Well that's news to all of us

370
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Where's the narrative come from

371
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
A character reference

372
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
For this

373
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
Crazy warm

374
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
Anytime anyone thinking something bad about that

375
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Just come talk to me and I

376
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391

Romeo come talk to you in 20 years if we're still friends

Still alive by poker in awhile but

00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
We talkin

383
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,367
We're talkin to sneak attack baby

384
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
$10 game

385
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
I don't think I do that

386
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Burroughs

387
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Okay thanks

388
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Directions to Naperville

389
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Girls f****** stop it

390
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Sure

391
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
Absol

392
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
This weekend

393
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:36,128
How did the March for our lives

394
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Around the country

395
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
Tons and tons of people came out to protest

396
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
A gun regulation

397
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
I have you

398
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
I should let everyone know I am an NRA

399
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,000
A Boy a Gun

400
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:56,608
That no one will know whose kids are did you hear that I heard that argument which is

401
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
Kind of callous

402
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
A little bit little bit rough

403
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
To hear

404
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
I think like a

405
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,592
I think that the gun question is becoming a little bit muddied

406
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:11,968
I'm strongly in favor of what these kids are pushing for and what have you

407
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
But I think it's

408
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
Need to get the perception that everybody wants all guns

409
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Destroyed or all guns

410
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Confiscated

411
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
And I don't believe that that's necessarily the conversation

412
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
I think the people on

413
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,352
Some people on Twitter think that's the conversation

414
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
What's happening pushing

415
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Instead of actual having a,

416
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
Translation Leicester way of pushing back

417
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
Just last year with the Democratic

418
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
Text Heather

419
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Uniforms

420
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
No no

421
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,624
Interpretations that have been done by the evens

422
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Supreme Court about

423
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
The Second Amendment have said clearly that

424
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Second Amendment

425
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Does allow for

426
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,816
Some regulation that could happen

427
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,448
Regulating what appropriate sales of guns are and s*** like that

428
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
Does

429
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Wake Campus

430
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
She's really mad

431
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
David Hogg

432
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
Particular in this episode

433
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,088
Here's a really funny clip where he complains

434
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
About David Hogg

435
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
Amanda where Jose is fun

436
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,488
Hog

437
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
So he's running around

438
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,400
Horrible things about me

439
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
Wonderful person

440
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Angry with him

441
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,440
Thank you for teaching me in America how we should behave thank you David

442
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
It's so funny to me the repayments to an ad for super male after complaining about how a high-schooler is treating him

443
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:20,224
If that's what your f****** stuff does if that's what your supplements do for you that's the level of

444
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Strength

445
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Yeah

446
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
That is a mess

447
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,232
Also I love the presentation to the beginning of that that's like

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,072
He's not getting attention anymore so he's got a lash out at me

449
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,912
Legitimately that Bart was

450
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,960
Overflowing Street

451
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
And that's not just him

452
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
No

453
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
That's the

454
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
And he's going to keep getting attention while we do nothing

455
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Just they're not going away

456
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,456
That girl's going to Long Hair By the time

457
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Yeah yeah

458
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
David Hogg

459
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,024
Eclipse

460
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:10,144
You goddamn motherfukers apologizes

461
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
He understands was not appropriate because being interviewed at a dinner table

462
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
Not a not a professional operation at all

463
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
And he's just saying like

464
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
His conversational swearing other hoes to Alex's

465
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
8 year-old who just learned about the word sock

466
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
And stuff like that

467
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,792
If David

468
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Some criticism

469
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,864
Swearing like a human

470
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Squares I don't understand I feel like that's the thing that

471
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,008
I don't want to put Christians on Blaster like morel

472
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
The people that think they're the morality police

473
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
But if you would talk that way I can't believe you would do that

474
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,760
Yet you allow other people to get away with the worst things in the world

475
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
Who

476
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,744
Like we play enough I'm not that bothered by the fact that

477
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
You know you got it

478
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
He got it or whatever

479
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
But don't come at me like you're a great person and you're immortal

480
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Personally that you're cool with that.

481
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,776
Aspect to it I think zip

482
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
You know pain

483
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
People off

484
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
Do not be no they're not lying about

485
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
That's x-borg

486
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
Because he didn't want the evangelicals or whatever to think different of them or

487
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
Right

488
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
The train Jeff

489
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
Earlier

490
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
I apologize for derailing the

491
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,168
No that was on the rails

492
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
Weave back onto the

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
Clip train

494
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
We get back to

495
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,944
The Thomas middleditch beta male narrative

496
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
Okay

497
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Explain

498
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
What keys

499
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,088
Talkin about

500
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Computer stuff

501
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Comes out of beta

502
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
Beforehand

503
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
Understand why I talked about the cover of The Hollywood Reporter magazine

504
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
The triumph

505
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
They made fun of that

506
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
What do you mean

507
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
Star of Silicon Valley

508
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
And

509
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
It's amazing that

510
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
Impersonal

511
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
I meant that guy

512
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
Sxsw four years ago

513
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,864
I've been shooting with basically the whole cast.

514
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Call Jeanette

515
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Videos about Ozonics

516
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
Is that a brother Rodger Stone in 1 minute

517
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,384
That's how they turn this whole thing around

518
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
Pushing pushing

519
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Round robin

520
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Everybody's getting cancer

521
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
It's an agenda

522
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,304
Hollywood Reporter

523
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
Criticize the push by the government

524
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Oh that's what it is

525
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920
Is a person

526
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,976
Alpha male poses

527
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
I just type in Hollywood Reporter

528
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
Typing.com

529
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,904
The triumph

530
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
Hollywood celebrities

531
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,656
And then it is a subliminal of gay men

532
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
What are all putting their hands are pocket behind each other

533
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Is they have a

534
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:41,248
The name of that

535
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
I'm not going to say it on here

536
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
Alright thank you

537
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Interesting analysis

538
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah I think what he's trying to come up with is either a daisy chain the whole situation

539
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:00,704
But they don't take it the ladder Martin starwire

540
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
That's

541
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
That's been that's interesting

542
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
I think I think

543
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Of the

544
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Set up a

545
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Necessarily

546
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
If you're watching this live

547
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792

548
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,144
Do you think this is Buzz Marketing Alex's doing

He's getting a little bit under the table from HBO there buzzed Market as we've been talking about Barry at all

550
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,848
Another show

551
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
He's from SNL

552
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Stefan

553
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,992

Talking about he's everywhere

557
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
Very strange

558
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
It wouldn't surprise me to Terra Blade

559
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,304
I don't understand like what don't you understand if you watch the show

560
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
The whole show is there all just kind of f******

561

00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Profile

566
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Why would he ever watch the show

567
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Other than his good

568
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640

570
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,600
I understand they are actually friends

571
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:27,744
TJ Miller doing that I think about it

572
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:33,632
I don't know if middleditch

573
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
Fascinating

574
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
Zach Woods

575
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,104
Oh God to be a fly-on-the-wall for that

576
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
I got arrested

577
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
Is professionals all right I'm sure he'd

578
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,480
Yeah that checks out

579
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
Government trying to push beta males

580
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:59,232
Because they want to destroy the family the trying to feminize everybody right

581
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:04,608
Frog stuffed we're going to discuss towards the end of this episode

582
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Alex Jones doesn't understand

583
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,056
To weld up the headlines of things and then decides to extrapolate them to

584
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,616
Irresponsible degrees and that's what he's done

585
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
More or less

586
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
No

587
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,248
I'm so the government pushing beta males in the trying to make

588
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
Thomas middleditch

589
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,808
Thomas middleditch

590
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,136
I am Stephen Colbert

591
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
Beta males

592
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,256
On the show in order to make fun of Alex Jones

593
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
For talking about the government's plan to push beta males

594
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
Through this article and headline

595
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
It expects

596
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,216
No sense

597
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
You should be a cop

598
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,800
Like the way he can just twist things around in one night

599
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Going to get a lot of kids

600
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
Are huge and people up so hard

601
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
So many false conviction

602
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Speaking of

603
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
Rodger Stone

604
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
I have spoken

605
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Into

606
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
The people he probably shouldn't

607
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Have in the past

608
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Surfer 2

609
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,000
Well Circle article just came out

610
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,584
We talked about our last episode of The Daily Beast

611
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
Eyewear they've demonstrated that guccifer

612
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
2.0

613
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Apparently does crack back

614
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
2 Russian intelligence

615
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
What are the times that he signed on

616
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
Alaska server and IP address

617
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,944
It appears that it is actually Russian intelligence

618
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,480
Rodger

619
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
Has been like

620
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,136
Russian intelligence

621
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,464
Different

622
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
Because

623
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,864
Going to jail baby it's his position is slightly less defensible now

624
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,728
Sirius you always have a lot of stuff on your radar what else are you looking at right now

625
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:50,592
Well there's a big move today because The Daily Beast which is

626
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
Credible news organizations

627
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
In the country

628
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,528
I believe that they have proved gustafer 2.0 is a Russian

629
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,576
Which allows them to revive the headline

630
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Trump associate Rodger Stone

631
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
With Russian hacker

632
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Perfunctory

633
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,144
It is an Oculus

634
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Haha

635
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,360
It's a smear so the point is my conversation with him anyway

636
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,248
For the DNC material I bet Subway

637
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,832
But it gives the left an opportunity to recycle that headline

638
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,928
Trump associate Rodger Stone communicated with Russian hacker

639
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
It's fake

640
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Alex

641
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
Well I mean it's not it's not big news strictly speaking because

642
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
If

643
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,192
Reporting about guccifer 2.0 is correct

644
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Rodger Stone have contact

645
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,848
That is not fake news as a real headlights

646
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,920
Doesn't necessarily mean there was coordination between

647
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,504
That's not that's not that's proven but the fact

648
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
He was in contact with them

649
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
I've some of the messages

650
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,904
Why that there was some sort of

651
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
There's one message that guccifer sent him those like

652
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Paying you back

653
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
Or something like that

654
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,888
There's a lot of questions definitely need answers now

655
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
This development is

656
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,336
Come back using terms like that's ex post facto out trying to use legal terms

657
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,408
He knows he's got to protect himself a bit

658
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Re-up

659
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Of course

660
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
Rogersbase

661
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
A part of the investigation for a long time

662
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
PU

663
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,680
I mean I'm not pointing necessarily like a specific finger

664
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,288
But I'm saying

665
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,920
Before being like before

666
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
But that's still kind of like

667
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
A little bit

668
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
In this next clip

669
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,672
We get some fun

670
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
So

671
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
During Friday's

672
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
Episode show

673
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Donald Trump

674
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Is going to give us

675
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:24,704
Oh about the Omnibus spending bill

676
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
Sure thing of the day Alex

677
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Convinced

678
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
The Trump is going to veto it

679
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
As demonstrated in this clip

680
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,760
I will give you the extra battery

681
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:41,856
He's going to send her some good things and spending bills bad things

682
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,000
The border wall and because of spending

683
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
The swamp

684
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Is delivering a giant

685
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,656
So that this take

686
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
Is Trump

687
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Start speaking

688
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,056
And then we're going to get onto this

689
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,896
Ridiculous situation that took place over the last

690
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Week so

691
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Okay

692
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
Sorry

693
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
And As Trump keeps talking Alex realizes

694
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Oh

695
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
So we have

696
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Hi boss

697
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,168
Tilda Swinton from the Fox news feeds or the white house because there's this better

698
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,736
I don't like that too much in a dozen

699
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
So he's like

700
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,304
I got to figure out how to land on this list.

701
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
Flies

702
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
You don't have to go to

703
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
He's not honest

704
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,032
Buc-ee's on radio station

705
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,152
I feel like he

706
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
You showed some cards

707
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
There

708
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
He was expecting a veto and it didn't happen

709
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
I got to figure out where to land on this

710
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Everybody coming back

711
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Playing the press conference again

712
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
Say something

713
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Very not into

714
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,376
And I don't know why he allowed this to not like

715
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Whatever

716
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,776
Something inconvenience Alex's narratives happens usually just starts yelling over it and hopes people don't hear it

717
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Like whenever they do the debates you just yell over Hillary

718
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,528
He should have yelled over this

719
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,160
Our military equipment is the best equipment in the world

720
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
2 days ago with Saudi Arabia

721
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,048
And with other country Saudi Arabia

722
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
Hundreds of billions of dollars

723
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
Then we're getting

724
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:09,568
Therefore is a matter of National Security

725
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
Budget bill

726
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
He is literally saying

727
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,456
What is the consideration

728
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Was that we're selling

729
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,648
Millions and millions of dollars of our

730
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Stuff to tell

731
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,768
I thought I was in a billion-dollar it sounded like you said billion

732
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Well but to be fair

733
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,264
A real red flag for Alex

734
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,640
Billions of dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia who Alex is not in favor of

735
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Shirley took

736
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Our

737
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
Deep state

738
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
What have you

739
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,184
ISO

740
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't know why you played that

741
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
Let the

742
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
But he realizes that

743
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,400
S*** you signing the bill

744
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
EXO

745
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Trump keeps talking

746
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
Mustang

747
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
They must end

748
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
The filibuster Rule and get down to work

749
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
We have to get

750
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Legislation approved

751
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,368
It'll happen just like magic

752
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:32,256
The president is right behind here is the brace

753
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,096
And I

754
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,912
Because I have no way

755
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,128
I think that's something the present really should have

756
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Okay

757
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
Right on my board

758
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,088
Yeah shut it down

759
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
U-Store-It

760
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
That's not good

761
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
So

762
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
What's even worse

763
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,240
Did you rather Alex Jones come out again

764
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
I don't know I

765
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,896
Auto on one level in terms of like I'm always

766
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,248
Not pulling for Redemption cuz I think it's impossible at this point

767
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
But I'm always pulling for like that

768
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,136
Voice that's got to be in the back of his head the remembers who he used to be

769
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
No

770
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
Yeah stop putting up with this s***

771
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,328
I'm always pulling for that to happen but I know it

772
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
Did you see how much of his

773
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
The pastikan retcon

774
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
Iot keeps

775
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
Accepting whatever Trump does

776
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Yeah like what's Trump

777
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
Suspend the midterm election

778
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Algebra like of course

779
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
The Democrats are trying to steal all of these election

780
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
He's just trying to protect America

781
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,951
Heat that's the level of

782
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
Nonsense that he's capable of

783
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
It'd be a lot less

784
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Commercials auntie

785
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
CBI depreciate

786
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
That's one consideration

787
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Entitled

788
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Hellboy

789
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
Yeah we're all sick of that

790
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,383
It's back to the David Hogg

791
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,967
Situation

792
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Lake

793
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
I know there's a little bit during the campaign cuz jumps out of yelling

794
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
It's all through Rodger Stone

795
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Do you think Trump rolls around

796
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Every four years I go come around

797
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Reruns

798
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
A hundred percent

799
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
I think I'll show up if he's running again then

800
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
You know we're still there

801
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Be there like I have to

802
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,263
Yeah but I think most of the interaction if any is through Rodger

803
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,847
And I even have questions how much Rodger is necessarily speaking

804
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
I don't know

805
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
That that's all speculation

806
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,711
We can't pop

807
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,807
But what I can't I do know the truth about is that Alex

808
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
About to lie

809
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
About David Hogg

810
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,999
We can't we can't have it both ways you know like I don't know if I do

811
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
I don't I don't know that the ideas like

812
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
Labeling my child when it's

813
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Convenient

814
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,519
And treating me like an adult when it's

815
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
Yeah I don't know

816
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Anyway

817
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
The truth is Alex

818
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Taxis a child

819
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
And also his mother thought

820
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
I want to hear that

821
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,855
I'm going to air the profanity Lake

822
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,207
Sparta High School senior who is a public figure

823
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
He wants to debate

824
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,127
What's keratin

825
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
Bullying

826
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
No

827
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Alex was getting bullied

828
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
You hate to hear that

829
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
You just

830
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
I mean it is just what are you doing there

831
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Okay

832
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
Hutterites

833
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
I don't know

834
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
I think that

835
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
Scale of bullying

836
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Not very high

837
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
Very high on the scale of bullying

838
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,615
Consider people's

839
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
In-N-Out

840
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Position

841
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
Alex Jones being a

842
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
In charge of air

843
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,527
Quite large media Operation Ivy

844
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Probably

845
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
What about

846
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Ice cooler

847
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,511
Friends got murdered saying he's a scam artist

848
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
Yes

849
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
Using profanity when

850
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
You called

851
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Adam Schiff

852
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,567
C********* beat his ass cuz you're drunk on air

853
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
His statements

854
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
David Hogg

855
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
A little more palatable

856
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
They don't really

857
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,927
Poster child A3000

858
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,231
Where the mass shooting happened

859
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,591
To go out with

860
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
So what are they going to do

861
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Stromme

862
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:53,279
He's vicious Tyrant cussing and yelling at gun owners.

863
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
It's all

864
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Coming up

865
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
At the bottom of the hour

866
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
He's it up baby

867
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,215
Coming up at the end of the hour.

868
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:07,615
Couple more my pill commercials before we get to it and then you'll be disappointed

869
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
But the thing is when you saying

870
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:14,015
People are saying that I said they were crisis actors I didn't say that

871
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:20,415
All I said is that these kids are in the drama club in their actors and they work

872
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,439
Clearly chosen

873
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,327
With talking points that they're being given by the powers-that-be were clearly paid by Soros

874
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
It's like

875
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,495
You're just describing basically what people think crisis actors are and not using the term

876
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,823
To I don't find that argument

877
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
Super compelling

878
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
You know what every time this happens

879
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Alex's tournament

880
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
You can tell by this lady I just threw

881
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,927
Cuz she thinks

882
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,023
That's the most forward positive thing that's ever happened on this podcast

883
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
So

884
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
Did Alex get bullied

885
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
You could set your sights

886
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,519
I'll take it off at least drawing I just made

887
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,615
Buy ice cooler

888
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
How old is 40 Alex

889
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Same school buses a child

890
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,183
Getting bullied by a f****** seventeen-year-old

891
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,743
Another complaint

892
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,791
Operations

893
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,351
It's pretty hilarious

894
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
How does he treat

895
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,639
God continually misrepresented

896
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Facts about

897
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Continue

898
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,551
MPR pieces this week

899
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:57,695
MSNBC eclipse

900
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:08,191
No one died

901
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
Then

902
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,919
Works with

903
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
We visited before the shooting ever happen

904
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,063
Lobby Davenport were shut down YouTube

905
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,671
The organization

906
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
That's that's super

907
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,239
Interesting

908
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Oh no

909
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
A couple months back

910
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Alex Jones had Mike cernovich on

911
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,479
And they started a contest where they were going to pay people

912
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Thousands of dollars

913
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,855
To go on CNN with is Isis

914
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Yeah

915
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:04,255
It's Deanna is Isis shirts talking about how

916
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:10,911
Uncivil

917
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Needed that

918
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,447
Okay

919
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:17,055
You know it's not necessarily 121 connected

920
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,615
Inquiring minds are very fascinated by the

921
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,223
Tire contest was going to give out like

922
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Like a hundred thousand dollars

923
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
Two people who would die

924
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,647
Yelling

925
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,999
Yep they're complaining about allegedly George Soros paying people

926
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
It is kind of interesting

927
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,887
Well they didn't

928
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:49,055
I think so yeah I mean you did a contest where you pay people to go on TV and interrupt

929
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,127
Clinton rallies yelling

930
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
What's the paycheck

931
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
What's how much am I getting paid today

932
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,391
I think it's either a thousand or $2,500 pending on what you get on TV

933
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,999
If I got to be pretty nice

934
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,815
You just got to go find live television and

935
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Do you think you might

936
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Amanda Pann

937
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Depends on what you do

938
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,471
I don't think you get arrested for just yelling at Auntie

939
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
TV

940
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,311
I feel like they don't have to

941
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
The pay anyone

942
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,223
People who called said they got the money but I don't know how much I trust a vet

943
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
I don't know if you know this but there's a round

944
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,415
Did the United States allow these radio program sure about that

945
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,999
I think both of Alex's calls are real just cuz they're so dumb

946
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Like I don't think

947
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
I don't think you could

948
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
Specify

949
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Like an improv

950
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
Park at sketch actor to be this

951
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Yeah

952
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
This demand and right in line with Alex

953
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
His beliefs

954
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
I get real

955
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Isaac Moses

956
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
These calls are real if only because

957
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,967
Well first of all you hear the same people call pretty repeatedly

958
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,783
And then they just mirror bat him back

959
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,367
Difficult

960
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Not on this one now

961
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
I need to get the

962
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
I need to get that cord

963
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,071
It looks up the phone my old one broke

964
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:20,191
But I'd be willing to do that especially if you willing to do that with like people

965
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,591
Disgusted with them maybe once a year but it's up to you guys if you want to

966
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
Talk to Danny Jordan

967
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,455
Make it happen them calling a brother to people who like

968
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,039
You know you want to talk to him make it a patreon exclusive

969
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,879
$500 donation

970
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Use olive

971
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,815
Everything is an opportunity for a fundraiser

972
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,631
Play

973
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
Idea I would like to play the

974
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
Profanity-laced

975
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
Tirade the David Hogg goes on

976
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:01,151
Well you just a couple times he swears like the politicians don't give a f*** about us

977
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
And stuff like that

978
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
I guess it is

979
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,063
Technically profanity-laced

980
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
Expressing themselves

981
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
It actually to me is evidence that he is not

982
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
Crisis actor

983
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
Because if you want

984
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
People would

985
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Teacher like

986
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Don't

987
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,863
Where you don't want people to attack you for that

988
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
You have a much more polished media

989
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
Happened to be on the news

990
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:33,919
That that I don't know what you're talkin about on TV before cuz they got saved by a lifeguard

991
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
I have no idea

992
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:39,295
I don't I don't know this I'm resistant to all of those

993
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
I've looked into them in the

994
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,903
This Virgin of stuff

995
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
From tragedy

996
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
Arizona waste much

997
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,399
A little bit of David Hogg on CNN

998
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,191
Bigger ion C-SPAN

999
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
Because I think it's important

1000
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
And brings up

1001
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
Alex's

1002
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
The fame

1003
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,575

You're 17 you'll be 18

1007
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,607
You online with a video

1008
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,423
Attack by the Infowars crowd was that like

1009
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,431
I only mention his name

1010
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,903
Statue Asian that I don't want to name the name of but

1011
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
Agitated from Infowars

1012

I hate and Division in America

1016
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,151
Example

1017
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:19,135
Tap water is turning the frogs gay

1018
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,511
The advertisers water filters

1019
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,583
Interested

1020
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,359
Trying to fertilize eggs and don't exist and then the species dies

1021
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Okay

1022
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,711
He goes on from there to do about a five-minute commercial about his water filter

1023
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,039
David Hogg point

1024
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
The term Lakehead arosexual or hetero

1025
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,279
Article out of Berkeley

1026
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
Betty references

1027
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,631
Flashes it up on screen so I can tell that it's

1028
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
Exact article lady talk

1029
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,519
I'm about it in this article they found that frogs

1030
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
Highly

1031
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Exposed

1032
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,895
Two level high levels of actresses

1033
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
The chemical atrazine

1034
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,247
It is mostly byproduct of like

1035
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Plastic

1036
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
Production

1037
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,111
And pharmacological

1038
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
The pharmacological

1039
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Call farmview

1040
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,207
Okay like it's used as a weed

1041
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Killer

1042
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
A very good weed

1043
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:33,375
Killer 75% of the frogs that were exposed to high levels of atrazine end up chemically castrated

1044
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
10% were shown to be comfy

1045
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:40,031
Quote the 10% or more of the turn from males and two females

1046
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
Can successfully mate

1047
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
With male frog

1048
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,199
But because these females are genetically male all their offspring are male

1049
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
So that Pinterest

1050
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,295
It's pretty wild thing

1051
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,903
Cool yeah it's in relation to this guy from Vice

1052
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
Decided to look into it and talk to some

1053
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
I'm just about what the ramifications

1054
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Who's this

1055
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,583
If there's any reason for humans

1056
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,679
To be concerned

1057
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,007
Neuroscientist from the University of Nottingham

1058
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,055
Told this reporter from

1059
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,383
Frogs and many species of fish named Ali the Nemo fish

1060
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Clownfish

1061
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,967
Can spontaneously change their sex anyway

1062
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
Fish are not human

1063
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,063
Then humans don't spend their lives living and breathing water

1064
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,623
Due to their natural sex flopping characteristics

1065
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,207
It's likely some fishing frogs are very susceptible to the actions of the pollutant

1066
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,047
But there's still no evidence that can influence the development of sexuality

1067
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,519
Until I read this from the Centrist

1068
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
Disease Control

1069
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,663
What are the primary ways that atrazine can affect your health is by altering the way your reproductive

1070
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,759
Studies of couples living on farms that use atrazine for weave

1071
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Control find it

1072
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
An increase in the risk

1073
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Preterm delivery

1074
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
These studies are difficult

1075
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,743
Interpret because most of the farmers were men who may have been exposed to several types of pesticides

1076
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Inconclusive

1077
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,887
Light connection but you can't really even do that

1078
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,215
Atrazine has been shown to cause changes

1079
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,007
Blood hormone levels and animals

1080
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,055
That affect the ability to reproduce

1081
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,663
Some of the specific effects observed in animals are not likely to occur

1082
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
Inhumans

1083
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,271
Because of biological differences between humans and these types of animals

1084
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,111
Atrazine also cause liver kidney and heart damage and animals

1085
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:35,231
It's possible that atrazine to cause these effects in human although this has not been exam

1086
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,583
So you can find that are kind of interesting

1087
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,631
We were like what about this

1088
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,679
A thing that Alex brought up earlier

1089
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,543
There's a study is 2008 study alabado is the name of the person

1090
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Who led the research

1091
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:55,455
They found that atrazine stimulates aromatase activity and human ovarian cancer

1092
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,039
Enzyme that converts testosterone

1093
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
Is produced by the adrenal glands by some cancer cells

1094
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
Cancer patients with estrogen promoted cancer

1095
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,535
Primarily breast prostate

1096
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
The class of drugs

1097
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
Designed specifically to block the production of Roman

1098
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
Thereby decreasing levels of estrogen impatient

1099
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,215
So

1100
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,775
Alex is trying to make the argument

1101
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
That aromatize

1102
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,919
HD that activity is stimulated by

1103
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
Have therefore will boost

1104
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
The estrogen levels

1105
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
People that end up dating

1106
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
The problem with this

1107
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
The first thing you find

1108
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
Is that the people who made that study

1109
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:45,375
Have retracted the study over concerns that they have a good enough job with the study

1110
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
Do you have a retracted study

1111
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,287
You have another study that was done on people who lived on the farms that showed

1112
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:57,407
Premature delivery that's inconclusive cuz they're exposed to too many other things

1113
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
Don't have a good

1114
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
Control group there

1115
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,527
All you have is this

1116
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Study of frogs

1117
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,135
Definitely doesn't relate to humans 121

1118
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Because frogs

1119
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
Fish to have some

1120
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Gender

1121
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,815
Changing it like it's good that there should be

1122
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,119
Stuck in the water and stuff like that but

1123
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,239
Legislator they change sexes

1124
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,287
Right but can reproduce

1125
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,615
Well I think I think it's because they aren't they end up

1126
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
Changing into

1127
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,711
Males and then end up breeding with males

1128
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
And that triggers our

1129
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
Go because they're females

1130
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,879
Internally

1131
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,671
I don't know I don't know

1132
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:45,023
The article doesn't say that the frogs are gay it says they change

1133
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,327
I guess would be sex

1134
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:54,239
So also from the Centers for Disease Control just in case you're worried that this is in all of our tap water

1135
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
I had well water I want to see what's going to happen to me

1136
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:02,431
Interested

1137
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,527
The Environmental Protection Agency identifies the most serious hazardous waste sites

1138
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,855
These sites make up the national priorities list

1139
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,439
And are the sites targeted for long-term Federal cleanup activities

1140
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
Atrazine has been found in Italy

1141
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
20

1142
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
Of the 1636

1143
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Current or former npl sites

1144
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
So that's not a very high number

1145
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
Atrazine to taken up by all plants

1146
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,751
Butt implants not affected by The Afters

1147
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Sandwich Arby's

1148
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,079
Target

1149
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,407
It is broken down before it can have any effect on their photo center

1150
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,735
And therefore it's not in the foods that come from

1151
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Atrazine treated plant

1152
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
Supply isn't the natural

1153
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
Concern that you could be exposed to it

1154
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,951
Most people are not exposed to atrazine on a regular basis

1155
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:51,583
People live in your areas where the atrazine was applied to crops maybe expose through contaminated drinking water

1156
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,911
Atrazine has been found at about 20 Superfund Site

1157
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
Supposed to be

1158
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Npl site

1159
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
In the United States

1160
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:01,055
People living near those sites may be exposed to higher levels of actors

1161
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
If you're a factory worker who works with atrazine

1162
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
You may be exposed to higher amounts

1163
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:11,039
The government has estimated that approximately maybe expose this way

1164
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,599
So the numbers of people who are actually

1165
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,183
Damaging lie or dangerously exposed atrazine

1166
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
Massively

1167
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,255
Over-exaggerated

1168
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,607
Sure

1169
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:29,471
And that the other thing that's even more f***** up is if you really want to talk about

1170
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,263
You know the problem

1171
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
Do

1172
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
You know is there are these couple of farms

1173
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
The farm 20

1174
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:43,295
Well 20 site 20 hazardous site but could be more Farms

1175
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,671
That aren't nearly as polluted but could still affect groundwater somehow

1176
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
You know what would solve that

1177
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
Regulation

1178
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,655
That's not good that's that's the end solution to that problem

1179
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
I've been documented happening

1180
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
Two frogs

1181
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:10,175
Because because of pesticide and groundwater contamination

1182
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
But this is not

1183
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,271
All applicable to humans

1184
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,343
And Studies have shown that have been retracted

1185
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
5 people go down them because they

1186
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Yeah

1187
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
It does make me wonder what I drank

1188
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Because a child

1189
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
Cuz I did drink well water in

1190
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
So I could have been

1191
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
Could be Mercury could be a lad

1192
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,215
I'm crazy about that mercury

1193
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,007
Earlier

1194
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,567

Cuz I told him

1198
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,623
He's trying to save it like whenever he's like I don't want to say his name

1199
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Because

1200
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
He tried to protect himself from a lawsuit

1201
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
When reality

1202
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
But also when the interviewer is asked

1203
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,983
You were the target of Infowars like group

1204
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263

When the media edits his clips

Trudeau I don't even know if it came directly from him

1288
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,687
But the Canadian government was trying

1289
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
To get people to use gender-neutral

1290
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,319
Words whenever whenever it would be appropriate

1291
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,391
Instead of mother or father

1292
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,183
Just to be non-specific about it

1293
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,719
Anna

Someone else that's not why

1298
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,383

1302
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,679
Controller

1303
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:40,223
Do you really

1304
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,831
Eating a cheeseburger in shooting a gun

1305
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
Announcer when I heard

1306
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,071
Google was right there

1307
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,655
Beta male

1308
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,519
I'm calling the cops

1309
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,055
And he just jumps

1310
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
Alex

1311
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,639
Cut it went completely different conversation

1312
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
So it sounds like it makes no sense

1313
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:17,343
Essentially catering your searches based on algorithms

1314
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,399
Minions

1315
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:35,775
Friends when they don't even exist

1316
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,103
It's out there so maybe people

1317
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
I'll buy it

1318
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,839
I noticed this morning

1319
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,191
Chemicals in the water

1320
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,239
They are so worried about that

1321
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
Because it's a fact

1322
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:13,407
It's because of the terrifying underlying assumptions

1323
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
There's things underneath

1324
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
The statement

1325
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Especially about the idea of

1326
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:24,159
You know this thing is that they are putting in the water that's the first thing

1327
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:26,207
Runoff

1328
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:36,191
That's really the place where it comes it's not like there's a massive Global it too or just trying to poison the groundwater like it's Batman

1329
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,983
Begins some s***

1330
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,055
Then the second part is

1331
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
If if

1332
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,895
We go along for the ride

1333
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,759
They're inducing homosexuality

1334
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
People

1335
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,343
And Alex be saying

1336
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,623
Myproducts

1337
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,671
Will help fight back again

1338
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,463
To some extent

1339
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:03,327
Uncomfortable underlying

1340
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
Peace there

1341
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
I believe

1342
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
If I stop using my brother

1343
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,495
Start sucking dick

1344
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:16,895
That's a possible I think you could take

1345
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Aqua-pure

1346
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,927
I will again I am more than happy to suck a dick

1347
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
And I'm talking Romeo

1348
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,263
So you got you got that

1349
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
He added that clip

1350
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:48,895
In order to make it look like it jumps to nonsense about

1351
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919
About Trent

1352
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:53,503
Google searches

1353
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
Probably

1354
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,647
I think that most people don't pay attention to do Echo

1355
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,695
Yes

1356
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,487
What is life clip

1357
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
Alex ruminate on

1358
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,583
On their other interview

1359
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
The show

1360
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
The way he always

1361
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:13,983
Celebrate

1362
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:20,383
Cowardly chicken

1363
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,487
Superstore.com

1364
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:41,119
Huge discounts on water filtration air filtration system

1365
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
Yeah

1366
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
So anyway

1367
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,519
He brings us to the end of February 23rd of March

1368
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,591
I feel like based on your doodling

1369
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,127
Throughout you didn't

1370
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,199
You didn't enjoy this all that much

1371
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
Baby I'm so sorry that I wasn't listening

1372
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:00,831
I do I did I wasn't listening

1373
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
I'm self-conscious

1374
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,975
I always feel bad when I have to bring someone else into this world of unpleasantness

1375
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Sure

1376
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:14,911
I was thinking I don't know if people would want to buy this either we should put it on a t-shirt okay

1377
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,471
Excel the original print

1378
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,567
I think that's the best way to go about it

1379
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:25,151
Half of it goes to this podcast having to go to the artist

1380
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:30,527
Be happy to sign it and be happy to record a podcast about why I drew it

1381
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,063
I love you God

1382
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,599
Don't screenshot it

1383
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,623
But just have it

1384
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
Though that's

1385
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:41,791
Dirty pool pay your $500 like a good American person would amen

1386
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,095
I told you before we went there and I might have said it on the pocket

1387
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
I normally they're sad

1388
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
I'm not sad

1389
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
No cuz it was all just stupid

1390
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,239
Yeah that's fine

1391
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,943
But anyway people can follow you as the mattress also I have a fun podcast

1392
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735

01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759

01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,783
We'll be doing more of them

1395
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,183
Website

1396
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,535
Kids.com is not my website

1397
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
The bad news

1398
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,191
It's very okay

1399
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,007
Vinyl area

1400
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,151

We are at knowledge fight.com

1405
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
69 is too many characters

1406
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423
Sure

1407
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,007
It's also weird today

1408
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:02,943
It generally at the end of this these episodes we tell someone to go f*** themselves

1409
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,831
Really

1410
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,951
Fairground of us telling

1411
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,023
Specific guy to f*** himself at the end of every episode

1412
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,303
And then

1413
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
Decided to give him a break and now we switch

1414
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,239
The fill-in Jordan I feel like I should give you the honors of who from
