00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:21,248
You were somebody who had let's say lost

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Faith Betty's country

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
Entry would ever possibly work

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
Is a functioning democracy

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
See you again

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
And would stay

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Instead

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
Descend into a corrupt kleptocracy

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Till the end of time

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
To celebrate the holiday

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
That most

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
Exemplifies the worthlessness

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
Brave

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
What podcast would you recommend you want to listen to something

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
Rome burn

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
Check out knowledge

19
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,624
We haven't we bring to you

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
Happy Fourth of July 5th when this comes out

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
The fourth is generally we have an episode on

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,728
Most people probably aren't in the office

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,056
Second Civil War

24
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
I heard about that

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
I don't know someone died I guess

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Clowning on Alex

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
Twitter and doing

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
I'm second Civil War letters

29
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,856
Oh I like that

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
It's fine but sausages

31
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Buzz Marketing for Alex

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
People don't realize

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Like I really want to be clear about cuz I got a couple questions

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
People who were like

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
Hey you guys that you know

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
You guys think about that

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
I want to spend much time on this second Civil War nonsense

38
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,152
We've already seen him do this over and over again

39
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
That last time I had that big March

40
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Another women's March the other one

41
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
I can't remember what it was

42
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
I think it was the March for our lives

43
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
Right after the Parkland shooting

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208
Alex's rhetoric was that that was when Democrats were going to launch their Civil War

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Moved

46
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
To take out Trump

47
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
They're going to kill him

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Perhaps

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Like all this stuff

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Recycling

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Stuff over and over again

52
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
People getting excited about it it's like

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
You just

54
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
You're getting into the rerun

55
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Already a little bit

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Celebrating

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Some freedoms

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,600
And maybe personal freedom but also the other thing is that like

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
I get why it's really fun

60
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Clown on Alex

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
We do it a lot

62
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
In

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
In various ways and I understand that I'm probably make

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Looking to find a line that most

65
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Really appreciate her under

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
When it becomes

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
The number one

68
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Trending hashtag

69
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Go the second Civil War hashtag

70
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,808
To making fun of Alex people don't recognize

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
A lot of the time is that like you don't give a s*** if people are making fun of him

72
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
It doesn't matter

73
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Because most of the people making fun of him

74
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Are people who would ever

75
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Consider him

76
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
To begin with

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
They don't he doesn't care about that

78
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Already

79
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
So they might as well be May

80
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Is Bucking name out there

81
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
And gives a better chance

82
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
The 20%

83
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,872
Why is everyone making fun of them

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
He says

85
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Whatever people on Twitter

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
Whatever it is it

87
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,672
Exactly

88
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
And then the flip side of it to is that like

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,328
The idea that somehow he's going to be humiliated when they

90
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
This doesn't happen

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Never was

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
But beware

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
It doesn't matter

94
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Because he has built-in narrative

95
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
And place it doesn't

96
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
When it doesn't happen to be like yeah because I

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
They're playing

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
I stopped

99
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
The second Civil War by publicizing it

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
You can play that card if you want

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
What's 2

102
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
Is not over there could be

103
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Terrible firework

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,583
That way

105
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Oceans 8

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
That 20

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Percent that he's not as

108
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Engaging

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
In this stuff is really only giving

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Free marketing

111
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
Happy 4th

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
Distracting those who would start

113
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
They were too busy clowning I'm busy

114
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,231
Yeah right

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Never going to have

116
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
I hate it and I understand

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
The impulse and I appreciate it.

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
I live in this weird

119
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Space where it's

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,287
I know the best thing to do with

121
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Betake norham accepted

122
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Very specific

123
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Pick contacts

124
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Ways that are good to

125
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Take care of him and

126
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
And deal with him

127
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
Everyone live your lives

128
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
You just did it you just talked

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,863
Pictures of out of your own position it's the same position are they go ahead and do it but just recognize the

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
You're not scoring a point on him

131
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
You're just

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
You're sort of playing into his hands a little bit

133
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
This is the only PR strategy

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Because no one will take

135
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Good morning

136
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Advertising

137
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Same people who work

138
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Defending the daily

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Stormer is his

140
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Neo-Nazi

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Lawyers

142
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
His lawyers

143
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
Well lawyers who were also like

144
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,863
It also to me is like another thing people are clowning on that

145
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
That doesn't mean the lawyers are neo-nazis

146
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,479
Some deal nephews are protected by

147
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
I get the urge

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
To be like haha this is

149
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
The link to him

150
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
I got a lot of

151
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
I'm telling you

152
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
One thing that we never

153
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,255
Affected when we wrote all those laws was the necessity of adding a

154
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Except for not

155
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
First Amendment

156
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
We just got to rewrite all that

157
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
We added

158
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Bad breath

159
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Even consider Nazis of protector

160
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Class

161
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
You wouldn't think so

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Before interior

163
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
But we'll never get there

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Because government

165
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
But like I said

166
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
It's time to celebrate our freedom

167
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
And so I decided I don't want to talk about Alex

168
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Here's what we're talkin about

169
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,263
Hi everyone I'm sure Cassidy from Project Camelot and very happy to be here today

170
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,639
We're going to be talking to Eddie page and this is my second interview with him

171
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,991
Should be a lot of fun he's also been putting out some videos of his own

172
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,111
In his own words his life story and he does that on his YouTube channel

173
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
He does do anybody page

174
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
I'm going to go with the

175
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Bastard

176
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Jimmy Page and Eddie Vedder

177
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
No Eddie Money

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Incorrect

179
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Coleman Jr

180
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:43,871
No absolutes

181
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,807
Story is dealt with in another interview that you did with Terry

182
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Within a week or so

183
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
I will

184
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
As a beginning

185
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Syllabus

186
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Animal get into

187
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Two more as we go along

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
He's a guy

189
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Who claims to be a pleiadian

190
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,839
Alien being

191
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
Who is doing the interview with Harry

192
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
I got to say most of his backstory

193
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Not super important

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
This isn't we do it

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Flashback format

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
We can just do small chunks of it we don't have to

197
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
To deal with the entire back

198
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,991
Do as we go along

199
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Detail as you need

200
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
What's important

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
This is one of the weirdest Project Camelot interviews I've ever heard my life it goes so far off the rails

202
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,095
Go off the rails like the one with Courtney Brown

203
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
Where you talk about his remote

204
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,727
I'm talking over this

205
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:47,615
You disrespected Mark Richards even though

206
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,247
The Camelot

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,879
Also the one with the guy who was like under that museum there's a demon

208
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,255
Bright right

209
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Her loyalty

210
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
Really weird

211
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Amazing liar

212
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
But this goes

213
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Even further off the rails

214
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Disrespecting Mark Mark Richard

215
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
It just has to do with Eddie page

216
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Being

217
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
A chief weirdo

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Aza

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
And then he was his name Junior because of that or was his play again

220
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
And then I don't know

221
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
The page part of it I don't know

222
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
I don't know the etymology of his name but I do know that his

223
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
Something some sort of like

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Angelic being

225
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Human neck

226
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,311
Let's say

227
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Like Michael

228
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,407
Yes it's okay

229
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Toronto

230
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,575
Something like alright

231
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,999
So you may not know this

232
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
But it's

233
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Until he was much older in

234
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Oh yeah

235
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
This is that is just a little bit about his dad

236
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
As a young child I remember meeting

237
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
My father

238
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,575
I've never met this man until I was four years old but

239
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,415
Looking in his eyes and knowing

240
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
And magnetism that I knew

241
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
This is very special

242
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
It is

243
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
He I like her

244
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Have you couches this

245
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
The beginning

246
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
I think a lot of people be able to identify like this I was for

247
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
He was a special

248
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
When I looked into his eyes

249
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
So in terms of identifying

250
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
Both

251
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Large junk

252
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
The population away

253
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Yeah I think I mean I know that a lot there's a lot of

254
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
Single parents out there and s*** like that I understand

255
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
You don't know your dad is beginning of your life

256
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
But that's.

257
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
That's not everybody

258
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Usher

259
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Find out

260
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Age of 30

261
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
This man that I admit 1957

262
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Was my father

263
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,767
It was our father I just like saying I don't want to seem greedy but

264
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Very proud to find out

265
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
This man

266
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
Okay now

267
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
You found out when you're 30 aren't you mean you went through 30 years without knowing that you're pleiadian

268
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Well

269
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
So

270
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
This introduces the first problem

271
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
You know we we

272
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Who painted

273
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Kerry Cassidy

274
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Perhaps the worst

275
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
Interviewer of all time

276
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
The most credulous at the very

277
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Stripes

278
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
At this point like in this interview haha

279
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
To the fire about

280
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
That I think are pretty impressive

281
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Being a good interviewer but I realized

282
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Usually far more nefarious

283
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:41,855
I'll explain as we get to it there's a remarkable thing happening here

284
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
Dominance

285
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
It's going to be fascinating the way this plays out

286
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Scary cats

287
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Ifucking Alpha

288
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
She could tell that this dude is

289
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
The chop

290
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
Play do we find out here that Kerry Cassidy

291
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,591
Is

292
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,455
It went what we end up finding out I'm probably showing way too many cards way too early

293
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
She might be

294
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
With

295
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Trucking

296
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Guy in prison

297
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,975
She's she's now screwing with my crutches she might be Puppet Master and Margarita

298
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Alright

299
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
Usual Suspects that I have always wanted

300
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,983
But we'll see what you think as we as we go along

301
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
All the sudden her voice

302
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Get lower by.

303
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
I've known

304
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Do the s*** all along you assholes

305
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,759
F*** you

306
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,367
Also I think that's the backstory of Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy

307
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
Metastatic forwarded know until the 30th at 7 a.m.

308
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Pretty sure that was the one

309
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Didn't know that he was different

310
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Here's how you would describe it

311
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
You remember

312
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,807
I knew there was something very unique going on here

313
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
Where did you go did you see

314
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,047
And what did they say to you first I didn't say I saw anybody

315
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,399
So where you get to speculation what did they say to me

316
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
I would say all fairly standard

317
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
You might ask a kid that was missing for a little while

318
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
Like a kid that wandered off down the street is like where were you

319
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,855
Baby panda

320
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
Current behavior but

321
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
I don't know Alexa

322
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
See if there's more to this

323
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,447
The man in the dark

324
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
They were searching for answers and

325
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,919
Even today

326
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,759
I wouldn't I don't want to say anything all the answers but

327
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Weis Markets

328
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
Are you

329
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,167
And compared them to the my other 32

330
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
Special

331
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Kiara is the third of that 30

332
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
3 pleiadian children that were alone

333
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
To Earth or whatever

334
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,231
I guess I don't know through the government's fully aware of it the Vatican

335
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Nose

336
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Getting play in a little bit

337
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,703
Children born on to Earth

338
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
The Coleman family is taken care of them

339
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,847
Right there you says when I came into the age

340
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
That is

341
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Here's his story

342
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Broad stroke

343
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Works for the CIA

344
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
When he was 18

345
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
He went off to the military

346
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Vietnam

347
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Quite a fighter pilot

348
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
In helicopters in Vietnam

349
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Course

350
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Laser helicopter got shot down

351
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
And then he lost 11 days

352
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
So

353
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
411 days

354
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
He was on an alien

355
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
Right so they took him

356
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
I thought you lost

357
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Does he not remember them

358
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
I'm sorry I'm sorry

359
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Will be answered in

360
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
He pops back up on a field

361
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,535
Uniform that he was wearing

362
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
To begin with which is important because as

363
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Describe the key

364
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
Vietnam in a special issue black

365
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Infrared uniform with a special Elite

366
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Secret Service

367
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
This group They Carried high-tech equipment

368
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Special

369
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
Issue Colt 45 pistol machine gun

370
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
To assassinate the Vietnamese

371
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,367
I don't think

372
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
Even back then

373
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
He did not succeed

374
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
The only reason I bring that up

375
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
Specifically is because he had to explain why when he was found

376
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
I have his black Nani

377
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Infrared

378
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
I suppose I'm guessing that's why it's a piece of a narrative

379
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
Even a different uniform when they find him

380
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
But it wasn't 11 days later it was like

381
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Minutes later

382
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
You have crashed

383
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Or something along those lines

384
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
Well

385
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Okay

386
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
These are things that I can confirm or deny

387
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
So I'm choosing

388
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Believe it

389
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
As much as I think

390
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Stolen Valor is

391
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Super ugly

392
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,727
I also think the idea of me saying no you weren't

393
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
I have no idea

394
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Is Ron

395
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Right until someone can

396
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Can show me that you wasn't

397
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
I'll go ahead and take his word for it tentatively

398
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
But I will not allow that he was

399
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,279
Right

400
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,143
So what are you going to UFO that he told him they put them in like this yellow liquid that he can breathe in which

401
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,519
Super weird everything gets better

402
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Gets back

403
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Which is yours

404
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,759
He ends up getting recruited by the CIA

405
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
In his term

406
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Either reality

407
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
He got

408
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Simple regression

409
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
There was a guy named

410
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
And I believe

411
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
Charles Hamilton

412
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
Do you got a regression by a guy named Giles

413
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Yes

414
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
I think you just went to

415
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Regression therapist

416
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
In around

417
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Before 1980

418
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,431
85 that was right around when the satanic panic

419
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,575
My uncle was doing a multiple

420
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Went a lot of

421
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Psychologist

422
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
We're doing some really

423
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Irresponsible

424
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
Regression therapy

425
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,071
Repressed memory therapy where a lot of people ended up with

426
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Completely bogus

427
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Spell memories

428
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
But end up causing a whole lot of trouble

429
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
It's like going to see a psychic

430
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,359
You don't want to if you go see a regression therapist if there is no there's a 0% chance

431
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Figure someone

432
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
You wanted

433
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Do you want to be space

434
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
You want to be you are going to be different

435
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
And I certainly think

436
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
You come up with

437
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Sort of thing where

438
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Like I was

439
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Magically

440
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
11 days on a spaceship again so important

441
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
Replay ATM baby

442
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
Vatican knew about me

443
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
There's a whole lot of other stuff that's very

444
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Dubious along the way like you was in a car accident

445
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Brokaw

446
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Kind of bone but

447
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,879
Is magically healed the next

448
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
Flabbergasted

449
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,535
I was hoping that he broke bones but no other human being had

450
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
No but there is a

451
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,887
He is going to save this part

452
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
I think that this

453
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Worth noting

454
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
Brings up that he has like

455
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Blood

456
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Dave the doctor say

457
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Be determined is human

458
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
In human blood

459
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,575
Okay this comes from this comes from a memory that

460
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
He has underrate the regression

461
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
He's getting regressed by this Giles

462
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
Individual

463
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,216
Except for in relation to him

464
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
From his memory

465
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
There were 20 people staring

466
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Do the glass enclosure

467
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
This is after

468
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
He is gone

469
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Vietnam

470
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
Magical experience

471
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,136
People staring at me through glass

472
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
Enclosure as if they were studying

473
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
I can overhear what they're saying

474
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Beside me or three people

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,536
The head of the CIA Robert Brooks

476
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Chief assistant George Bush

477
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
Vice President Gerald Ford

478
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
They're all showing a picture of a flying saucer

479
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
I recognize that photo I seen it

480
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Before

481
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
The DNA cannot be labeled

482
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,872
The blood type cannot be labeled but does contain some human blood

483
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
So

484
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
Visit this idea is something that comes from his regression to all of this

485
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Just like

486
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,808
All right you seem like maybe a suggest

487
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Purple guy

488
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
So-so

489
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
He had the head of the CIA

490
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
And George h.w.

491
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Event also Gerald Ford

492
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
So-so

493
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,144
One future president

494
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
1 current president

495
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Current vice president

496
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Okay

497
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Because

498
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,688
Because they showed him a picture of a flying saucer

499
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Well no because

500
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
According to what he believed

501
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
He crashed his helicopter and then miraculously

502
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,792
Healed and so they're like whoa what happened here you're in a totally different uniform

503
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:05,472
A miracle it was 11 days ago

504
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,592
So that's most of his story

505
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
We got the broad Strokes

506
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
Events and future president head of the CIA they showed him a picture would you know me

507
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Actually remember

508
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
The doctor absolutely they were all watching him

509
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
So he could be shown a single photo

510
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
And he will be like

511
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,656
Oh yeah I know that one

512
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
You don't need to feed your friends

513
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
Isn't there for a blood

514
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Certainly don't

515
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,824
Email address

516
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
Yep

517
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
More or less all you really need to know about his experience I'm sure he would tell you that there's a lot more details

518
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
And I respect that but we have a lot to get to

519
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,512
I respect that

520
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
And that is the Carrie is

521
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Really hung up on this idea

522
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
Like weight

523
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
No n

524
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Any of this until you

525
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah why is she hung up on that

526
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Okay but

527
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,688
Just to ask you to question a little bit more clearly

528
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
Realize

529
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,048
Priest from the agency

530
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
Assassination and so on

531
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,568
Used to being interrogated

532
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Zen

533
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
You grew up

534
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,480
You're telling me that you and your host family

535
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
Did you know you were adopted during that time cuz I thought you did know after certain age and then also

536
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
So did you go through school

537
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
And did you know that you were that you were not human or did you not find out until the 8th

538
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Age of 30

539
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Relevant

540
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
Necessarily

541
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,552
Probably

542
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,088
Although some of it

543
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
So he doesn't know

544
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
He didn't know until he was 30

545
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Gary has clearly

546
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
Lestat you heard her question

547
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
I was good at school

548
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,648
I don't know what he talked about now

549
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
And I told her I said actually I'm bored

550
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
And I explained it to her

551
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,032
3 days later

552
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,104
My people who I called Mom and Dad

553
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Alien

554
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
He gave me

555
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
I had sound

556
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,096
Sounds

557
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,728
Weather in about 40 minutes I answered all quick all the questions like 300 in there

558
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:56,128
Hoover Dam

559
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
So you was bored this year

560
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,160
And I said no ma'am she says you have not missed one

561
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
Well I bypass the ninth grade

562
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:19,936
Nn

563
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,824
Special ed

564
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
I was the only one in there I would take him

565
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Outlook

566
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:39,136
This is an old man telling a boring story

567
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Telugu

568
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:46,816
This is what

569
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,704
Because of the generational differences maybe there wasn't one already established

570
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,264
At the school

571
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Maybe they had to make one for him

572
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,872
And that created real feelings of like soup

573
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
Superiority and different method

574
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
From a very young age and those have been transmuted into

575
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
I'm an alien kind of feeling

576
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,720
Put into the special advancing

577
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Through

578
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,632
If any of this is true through classes your social group behind

579
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Current it at this time

580
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Was he also fighting NBA

581
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Little bit later

582
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
A little bit late

583
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,128
Graduated 12th grade

584
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
You should have been in 9th grade

585
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
That would been like what

586
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
15 16 years old he's graduating

587
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
High School

588
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Two or three years before he

589
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Vietnam

590
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
Vietnam

591
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Oh okay

592
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
What is bumming around

593
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,048
I don't know

594
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Sound barrier

595
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
Just put a button on that

596
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
I just wanted to show like

597
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,336
I don't feel like people get a really good sense of how boring a lot of these episodes are

598
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Like we talked about a lot of the fun stuff with the

599
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Crazy

600
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
They're also sometimes

601
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,784
Two-minute stories about the gifted program

602
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,856
Where there's just old lonely people who want to talk

603
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Did not realize that I was in a

604
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
Didn't know that but now I kind of think

605
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
I was in Tripoli the

606
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
To program at our school but I

607
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:25,888
I did not skip any

608
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Well that's not alien

609
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Easy to prove

610
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
If I had any

611
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Special skills

612
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,664
Is wondering about Eddie Reddit

613
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,224
Also find out about

614
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,272
Your ears up a little bit when he said that

615
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,088
He predicted the JFK assassination

616
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,392
We're going to learn about the details on that

617
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,632
I did this and then I went

618
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
10th grade but I skipped

619
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,032
12

620
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,336
Super advanced

621
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Not at all of these people have that sort of like

622
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
It's the intellectual version

623
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Stolen Valor

624
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
Let's just put it this way

625
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
Growing up

626
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,608
I was much different than the kids

627
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,216
The Coleman family My adoptive parents

628
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Visions

629
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
This man didn't

630
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
23rd 1963

631
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,072
Looking good are you

632
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
37

633
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
Good morning

634
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
No I couldn't

635
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
Watching back

636
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
I think my skills

637
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
We're having to be recharged

638
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Call me the process

639
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:25,952
That's probably the process that's what he thinks happened when he was in Vietnam I got there

640
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
But I would say

641
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
Harsh materialist perhaps

642
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Futureworld little bit

643
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
Alright

644
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
I would say

645
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
That the most likely explanation

646
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,056
Here is it as a child imagine

647
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Someone getting their head shot

648
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,688
Apple X maybe you saw it in a movie

649
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
JFK was assassinated

650
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
10 years old

651
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,296
And he can

652
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Conflated

653
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
Precise memory of a tan

654
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
TV with the earlier feelings.

655
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
You had and decided that

656
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
He had predicted it all along

657
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Because

658
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,864
VIP

659
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
Vivid picture in his head

660
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,544
Someone getting shot in the head no it was the president

661
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Not a b not a prediction

662
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,872
No that's just a mental image

663
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
He's kind of what we call a dream as well would also function is

664
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Probably had.

665
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,880
That thought

666
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Probably thought about it

667
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Visualize and attack

668
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
That's fundamental

669
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
This is not impressive

670
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
Psychic work

671
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
Now that's a bet

672
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Call Dad

673
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:46,080
Off the glass

674
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
No but I know when you know you need

675
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
Need to get yourself some sort of credibility

676
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
In this world and by this world I mean

677
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
This world

678
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,552
Right right

679
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
Cuz how you going to prove it

680
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,184
How's it going good just proved that he called it when he was 8 or whatever you know

681
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
F****** know

682
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
I promise you

683
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Weird

684
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,840
It is weird

685
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
To hear somebody

686
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
Tell a very humble version of the I'm a psycho

687
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
I got the I got the

688
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,176
Yeah I had a vague

689
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Wheeling

690
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,528
I had like two out of five is dodging was ahead

691
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,368
It was weird

692
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Seems like

693
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
It's kind of boring

694
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
A little bit

695
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,584
Because we we have his bag back story that I've had to fill him

696
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
He went to a gifted program at this

697
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
There's not a lot

698
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
He thought about

699
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
Someone getting shot in the head for JFK

700
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,800
Alien none of this is Nessa

701
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,592
Sincerely all that good I promise you

702
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
Is it going to go places

703
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
That are

704
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,296
Unbelievable really what this sounds like right now is like a guy who's just

705
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:04,928
Instead of being like just turned it into a very low-key like

706
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Also I'm an alien

707
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:11,072
Like it's not even he's not even bragging really or like telling interesting stories or like

708
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Oreo

709
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
Making up of mass

710
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,984
Battle that he is the only solution for he's just kind of like

711
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,592
Alien siblings I was in a gifted program

712
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:33,856
Some of the self-important Slater out of this this

713
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Spit there walking through

714
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
That is

715
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Cleary clearly doesn't believe

716
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,536
Gary really as a problem

717
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,632
With no any of this s*** before you

718
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Pikachu

719
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
There's there's a big issue

720
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
The Carrie is going to flash out here in a second

721
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
Important and that is that

722
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
He went on this

723
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
Alien craft for 11 days

724
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,456
When he was 19

725
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,272
Then he found out about all this when he was 30

726
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,576
There's 10 years in between there

727
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,136
What the f***

728
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,440
It's not want to answer that question

729
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:14,816
Cascade around for awhile.

730
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Through the next few clips

731
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Perch fry

732
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Desperately to be like

733
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,192
I don't really believe you week

734
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
Got to get through this somehow

735
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Weird

736
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Okay now

737
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
You

738
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,456
Usually like to talk about how old I am but

739
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,040
I could say that I'm not that far

740
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Different from UA

741
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,880
So real quick earlier in the episode

742
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,648
He admitted

743
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Got it

744
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,976
65

745
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
65

746
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,864
Anyway when I was a kid I was very aware of

747
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Other dimension

748
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
Communication with other beings

749
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,104
Premonition that I was aware of

750
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
Actually I was being abducted at that time. Kind of memories as well and

751
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
And in my sort of ability and interest in in sort of

752
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,720
My Savior called the psychic realm Etc just expanded

753
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,816
And so that it was very very active when I was in my team

754
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
And in my twenties

755
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
And so on so

756
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
What I'm wondering is

757
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,080
You when I forget how old you were when you enlisted and then you have that

758
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,152
Experience in which you you know we've described that

759
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,944
Fire video for those of you that

760
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,016
Story in your tuning in now

761
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,856
You had 11 missing days

762
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Are you your whole body was put back together you met your father excetera but when you came after they wifey

763
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
Your mind see you then

764
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Remember that

765
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
And it is strange you know

766
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,960
In other words I guess when I'm kind of getting at here is

767
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
Guess you sound Advanced but you don't actually sound spiritually like you were very hit

768
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
Up until age of 30 is that cuz you grew up in a fairly conservative restrictive

769
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:17,696
Area I grew up in California which is very open to all kinds of things and

770
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:30,496
I was raised absolutely

771
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,800
Mount Shasta

772
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
And you

773
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
You

774
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,384
You pathetic

775
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,736
Corn eating what are you ready to go go f****** go back

776
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Cornfield

777
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Field of Dreams

778
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,440
Your dreams are boring what is that goes the hell out of here there's a there's a touch of that

779
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Hold on

780
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,816
Your other societies that are as well like Great Britain excetera

781
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
You know

782
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,240
Weirdest Dimensions other beings you know of all kinds UFOs

783
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
I don't remember when close encounters

784
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
Came out what year but you know that was coming we're just normal after that

785
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
And as a family we even saw UFO so

786
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
What I'm wondering is

787
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:22,208
Where was you know when they did these actually do you think

788
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
Dumb Jew down on purpose

789
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
So that you

790
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
You know on certain areas

791
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
Can you explain that

792
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
Focus

793
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,872
I would I would say that's not a fair question

794
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
That's no fair question to ask anybody did they dump you

795
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
That seems like unfair

796
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,904
Cuz she's given him an out for why she doesn't believe this right

797
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Well I can look down on you

798
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,256
Your story is

799
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
But

800
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,936
If you give me this now I've got a foothold now we can start blaming her parents for elevation

801
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,008
Dump him down on purpose

802
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,568
When they wiped

803
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Or something

804
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,040
Or maybe the government did it who knows

805
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,624
But I would say like just human-to-human or human to half

806
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
That's never that's never an okay question

807
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:29,280
Because like if I if you ask me

808
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,008
Bets you always look bad no matter what your answer is

809
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
I think you say

810
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,360
Regardless of which direction you feel you

811
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Do you say yes

812
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,968
You put yourself on a lower you know

813
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,760
Give your give yourself some humility

814
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,832
That's a relatable quality people like you more

815
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Mary's going to be like

816
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,136
You know what

817
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,208
Don't like how dumb you are but I like

818
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Picture in August

819
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:04,096
Maybe from the dump down person that's a good angle but like from an interviewer

820
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Very least

821
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Route

822
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,984
So at this point Carrie realizes

823
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
What I just brought up

824
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
Missing decade

825
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
And she's got to try him

826
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
Clamp onto it like a

827
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
Like a bulldog just

828
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,296
She will not let this go

829
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
And you just been in Vietnam you've been shot down

830
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:33,280
Almost died in a helicopter crash in a whole battle went off you you

831
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
Amazed Everyone by shooting all these people but you had no memory whatsoever at that point right when you were with

832
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
In other words into

833
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Langley

834
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
You still did not have your memories in my crap

835
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,480
Will my memories had been less a I still have a memory but it has been suppressed

836
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,392
You got to understand

837
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,256
Vietnam habits 1973

838
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
19

839
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Boneheads

840
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Greg Watson

841
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,176
Highways night

842
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
In 1973

843
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
They recruited me from

844
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Uni Japan

845
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:48,032
Let me get this straight cuz I'm I've read your book I'm almost completely done with it I have like a few pages

846
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Fascinating

847
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:56,991
Serrano's

848
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
You had it we had a

849
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
All he'll answer is I turn night

850
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,183
Vietnam and then in 1982 I got recruited

851
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,047
Explain a little bit that he was still like

852
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Working in the

853
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Paperwork

854
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
Service

855
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,911
Or something like that

856
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,215
His his his explanation

857
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
For like how the

858
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
The timeline works

859
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
With all this stuff

860
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,079
Really doesn't it doesn't make any sense

861
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
Doesn't really flush it out

862
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Delete scary to have

863
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Keep bringing it up

864
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
Especially for a guy

865
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
Has absolutely no problem telling a long

866
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,623
Year-by-year High School Story

867
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
However many three

868
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,255
3 years from Vietnam to Langley

869
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
What was he doing at Langley

870
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
How long was it

871
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,423
Only four days in Langley the FBI didn't he say he was in CIA

872
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
Oh okay

873
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
I don't know

874
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:02,015
You mean you never got your memory back about the

875
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:06,111
The Experience on the left of those 11 days

876
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,439
Even then what did you just do go back to work

877
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
I'm at now

878
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,727
What did you do what did you do in the Marine Corps after that

879
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
7

880
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,359
Don't tell me it's classified

881
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
He needs

882
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Just f****** around with her

883
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
If that's where he goes on to say like

884
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
As flying helicopters Ranch

885
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
Give me something

886
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
He's a skating like crazy

887
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,887
There's like nothing there's no holds like grab onto

888
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,423
Took your time to climb up this mountain

889
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
I am so Carrie has to

890
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
To try and offer him

891
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751
Suggestion

892
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
I just love that

893
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,335
So what did you do

894
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Go back to work

895
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
Sending you would been in Space by now this story

896
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
You you

897
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Yeah

898
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,111
If you're on Project Camelot you should be in

899
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,695
45 minutes

900
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,511
She's going to try and help

901
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,327
She's going to try and be like well maybe this is

902
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
During those do stores in Japan

903
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Were you

904
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,775
Were you kind of like in a state of

905
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,871
I don't know sounds like maybe suspended animation or

906
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Very confused

907
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
Because you

908
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
Did not recover yes and M

909
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,623
What happened into you in Vietnam so you had to be in some kind of state

910
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
Emotional state

911
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
What would you say about that

912
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,215
New Bern North Carolina

913
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,519
To get this to keep my earrings

914
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
And already knew

915
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,967
About Vietnam

916
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
The reason that I kept that there at the end

917
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Because that's not

918
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Answering request

919
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,695
Turn it off

920
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
But let's make this make sense

921
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
You just goes off

922
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
Into another vaguely

923
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,863
A related or unrelated story entirely

924
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
It's

925
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,239
Really frustrating for Carrie

926
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Piss every

927
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,335
Every question she asked wines of having an answer like

928
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
But I really

929
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,223
I was working on getting my

930
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Recertification papers

931
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
The most

932
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
That's super interesting story

933
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Needed to be recertified

934
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
Well I had a quite a

935
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Continuing education hours at the

936
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
FaceTime

937
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
I went and got a degree

938
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
What's a bartending College

939
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
Like the issue is

940
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
This is what you have done

941
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,479
Understand is they carry knows that her listeners

942
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Are going to be like

943
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Confused by the

944
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,807
Problem

945
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
And she knows that in order to get to

946
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
To the juiciest

947
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,183
He probably wants to say right they need to fix it

948
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,511
Because otherwise it's going to be a glaring hole

949
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
It just doesn't make sense

950
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:30,143
Fixing this

951
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
And at the same time

952
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
It exceeded like it's

953
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Frustrating

954
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
For her because

955
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,079
She wants nothing more than to believe all of it

956
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,871
She wants to believe it

957
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
But you can't believe it

958
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:47,295
No I did too

959
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,391
Because there's a bigger issue even than that

960
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Is a problem

961
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Certainly

962
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
You could you could make

963
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
Like if he was willing to

964
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,303
To give anything

965
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
Get away from it

966
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Like with the

967
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
Magical thinking that they always in

968
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:09,567
Project X clip

969
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Then I think

970
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,407
I think this one is really this is really tough

971
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,943
Were you a pilot

972
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
I think it was yeah it was a Tuesday

973
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
Are you sure

974
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
This part in but she's talking about like his exploits in Vietnam

975
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,207
A great pilot or flying sideways

976
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
So at this point

977
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
This to me isn't it

978
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,775
Essential problem

979
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,335
And I admire Carrie for bringing it up because

980
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,871
I'm going to call her swearing Carrie from

981
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,711
No faith that he's going to have an answer for them

982
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,015
Bring up a hard

983
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Question for him to answer

984
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
Is Bolt

985
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,111
Butter bark is this

986
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
Destroy the interview

987
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
But I think that she knows if there's another option

988
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,303
Little strange to me that that

989
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:12,799
There must have been you know they never do anything well it was don't-ask-don't-tell

990
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
South and they

991
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:23,295
Modus operandi of way of operating that they would have had you

992
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,927
From my understanding I'd like white on rice after that experience in Vietnam

993
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
Clearly demonstrated some kind of

994
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
Very different

995
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,887
Approach to life ability

996
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:44,287
He also had some some great skills as a helicopter pilot parently slide sideways into all kind of crazy s***

997
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:51,711
They would already has had their eye on you

998
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
And plus

999
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,319
In theory they knew exactly who you were

1000
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
They knew that you were played in

1001
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
Before you knew

1002
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Correct

1003
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,559
I wouldn't say they knew I was going

1004
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,375
I would unique I was different

1005
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:16,543
Know when did the Vatican write that letter I wish when you were a child

1006
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:22,175
That's ti8 the Vatican

1007
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,831
Sort of notified the CIA the CIA took complete control of the 33 children and place you and family

1008
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,623
Do you work now

1009
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,207
Maybe not every level CIA but certainly the top-level

1010
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
Oh

1011
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
Girl that sound is

1012
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
That's a sound of a TV look like

1013
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
That's good

1014
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
Point

1015
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,247
I really like her

1016
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
You know damn

1017
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,391
Everything about it

1018
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,839
Everybody knows

1019
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Can't keep track

1020
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
To compartmentalize

1021
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
So

1022
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Because she has a

1023
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Started this.

1024
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,663
They're at the end of that bird

1025
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Carrie

1026
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Herself

1027
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
To solve the problem

1028
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,367
That he is unwilling to solve his own narrative

1029
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,767
They the CIA and the NSA and the way they developed

1030
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
During those

1031
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
Years is to become more and more

1032
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,935
Into surveilling kids of all types

1033
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,519
Cuz they were very aware after Eisenhower dealt with the

1034
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
Gray

1035
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
The great human hybrid program objecting of human use of Art

1036
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:05,343
Cereals excetera excetera so you were part of a different group and they must have known that you were part of a

1037
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Treat you with

1038
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Kid gloves

1039
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,767
You know you are even if they didn't know you know know which ones you were

1040
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,071
They had a real close eye on you

1041
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,095
So okay

1042
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:20,447
So here we have a downtime and and they send you they let you kind of rest

1043
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
To where

1044
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,823
Nothing unusual at least

1045
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,919
Nothing too unusual went on in Japan

1046
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:36,319
Suddenly they play pop up in your life when you're 30 years old and they want to recruit

1047
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Why

1048
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
This is collaborative writing

1049
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,263
Exactly exactly

1050
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,311
He can come up with like

1051
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,359
Easiest explanation

1052
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:05,759
She is now you can hear it in her voice she's not asking that she's saying okay so now what is going on

1053
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
We're keeping an eye on you but they knew that you needed

1054
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,367
Some Kind of Rescue right part of the

1055
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,671
Greg

1056
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
You were someone who they could give

1057
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
And here's the rest

1058
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:23,679
Doing paperwork in Japan or whatever credit get back to you

1059
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,591
So now he's been completely

1060
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,687
Is not going anymore

1061
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,343
Dairy Square

1062
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
We'll get to why

1063
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
But

1064
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,911
Is 3 minutes long as longer than a lot of eclipse

1065
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,935
Baby usually have

1066
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,471
But it's

1067
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,031
Important to keep as a whole week interrupted if we know

1068
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
But it is

1069
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
What we saw on that last clip

1070
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:08,223
Carrie taking over and it becoming a writers room as opposed to an interview

1071
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
But like

1072
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,783
Cute to a rampant

1073
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
Fix that and at the end of this you will just

1074
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
He ready give up

1075
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
Eddie just signals is complete submission I like at the end of this is completely.

1076
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,375
This is like

1077
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
This is alien

1078
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Okay

1079
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:40,479
Actually wondered if they the CIA and

1080
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,295
Alveolar how do you say your name

1081
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,367
And the fact that you're supposed to be some kind of

1082
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:52,255
Guess you're saying it's written in the Bible that you're supposed to be some kind of avenging angel

1083
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:56,351
Real quick he's also apparently a name

1084
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,679
Supposed to bring

1085
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
I don't know I don't know I don't I don't I don't fully understand what this

1086
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,687
Also an angel whose come to bring

1087
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Destruction of some

1088
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,503
Alright

1089
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,575
The destruction or something along those lines

1090
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,855
Flights

1091
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,159
You know some crazy lady

1092
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:28,863
You're not supposed to fly sideways

1093
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
Sideways in a helicopter you're going to go left

1094
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Angel

1095
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
Although it's me

1096
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Seems like a major revelation

1097
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Kind of minor

1098
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
In the story

1099
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,391
In other words not such a

1100
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
Anais

1101
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
Kind of in the future

1102
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Supposedly

1103
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Now

1104
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,167
Demonstrated that really in this life so far

1105
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,471
Assuming that your father

1106
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:09,823
Call him what you were capable of

1107
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
I'm so and so forth

1108
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,687
You didn't exhibit any like

1109
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,759
What we have now you know superpowers soda

1110
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,831
At least you're not telling us that you did

1111
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,183
Conversation is being curtailed in certain way

1112
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Dating here and I completely agree your

1113
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,679
I think it's possible that your mother was a hoe

1114
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Real quick

1115
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,983
But it's not like

1116
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
You were born in

1117
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
You've already seen here

1118
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
Now

1119
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Beyonce angel

1120
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
You've seen her insults him twice

1121
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,551
And then also imply that like you're not telling me everything

1122
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
You know

1123
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,623
Which is the way that they get around all this

1124
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,975
Obvious b*******

1125
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
Sometimes you can't answer a question

1126
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Eyebrows lightly

1127
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:08,191
Smile which means it's not allowed to tell me

1128
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
Alright

1129
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
She's implying that

1130
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,567
And then also being like

1131
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,871
It's disappointing to talk to a plea ATM

1132
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
Not have any

1133
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,943
Real information and then also

1134
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
You certainly don't seem like you had superpowers

1135
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
During your life

1136
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,391
So he's already even but she even preamps that by saying like

1137
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,767
But I totally believe you're pleiadian

1138
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:37,119
It's because what she's doing is she subtly threatening to expose him

1139
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
I believe that what's going on here is like

1140
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Hurt

1141
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
Express

1142
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
Listen to him

1143
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
I see you

1144
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,103
And I know that

1145
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
What I'm saying now

1146
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,687
Should get to you

1147
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,247
And when I don't say you're full of s***

1148
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,575
I'm doing you a favor so now do me a favor

1149
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,647
And go along with his narrative that I'm building for you

1150
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
There's sort of a given

1151
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Intake going on here

1152
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
In terms of a con

1153
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,791
I really think that's what's going on

1154
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
It's fascinating to me

1155
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
To watch this happen

1156
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Look what I was watching this

1157
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Dynamic sir

1158
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
Henry 8th

1159
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:17,311
Like she is working with

1160
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,359
A first year of Second City

1161
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,919
She's like I'm an expert in this b*******

1162
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,967
Chirp you need to

1163
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,247
You need to step up

1164
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Your games on

1165
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,831
I can't be doing this

1166
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,879
I need you to bring the heat

1167
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,719
You're just a pleiadian right now I can turn you into f***

1168
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
Nothing if you have Aiden

1169
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
You better have beer

1170
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,375
You need to have beat absolutely that path or else people really like I don't

1171
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,447
Also are you for real

1172
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
It's level of

1173
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
Like I've never seen that much

1174
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Sculpting narratives

1175
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Cuz she's

1176
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,199
This goes on

1177
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
It is crazy

1178
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
This is coming from her

1179
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Suggested multiple things

1180
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
These last two clips

1181
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
So maybe this was the first time she just didn't do a pre-show like like she didn't do the

1182
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,911
Nothing seriously Wonder Lake

1183
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,703
If maybe she is allowed

1184
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
I have a tape recorder with Mark Richards

1185
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
But she doesn't

1186
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
So she can

1187
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,543
Depict at the way she

1188
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
Possible

1189
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
I don't know cuz it'll be the perfect

1190
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Fraud

1191
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
I mean Ethan freezer

1192
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:32,575
There's nothing you could do about it

1193
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,855
Releaf

1194
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:40,255
Is my bolshit possible to come to me with this

1195
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:46,399
I like that a lot it would also explain why like so many of these people that are on her show are like

1196
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,423
Legitimate

1197
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
Broad

1198
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,007
Like Sean ride that Sean David Morton

1199
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,287
Patrick Martin

1200
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,847
The dude was like doing time

1201
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Time for fraud

1202
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,919
Other people have had

1203
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Juno similar

1204
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,759
Patterns and their lives

1205
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
You know like yeah

1206
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,135
They would explain why there's all these tan man around all the time

1207
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,951
Because she's like your f****** around I'm talking around 2

1208
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
Do you have a convention

1209
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
Multiple songs

1210
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
Call Dick

1211
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
Conspiracy

1212
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
Cruise

1213
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,543
Sea love it

1214
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,591
Spiders like a conspiracy theory Cruise

1215
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
I love that

1216
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,175
He went on it and Main speaker

1217
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,479
And there's like a

1218
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,271
Advise that someone out

1219
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
To cover it

1220
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,623
A videos of him like dancing around being a real blow hard

1221
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
Stuff like that

1222
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
She got arrested

1223
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,631
The second.

1224
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,127
We're going to go on my lap

1225
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,919
These Bernard project

1226
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
That I'd like to

1227
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,087
That's it that's a man who's a f****** a lie

1228
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
Right there

1229
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
So you don't actually have necessarily

1230
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,143
Human DNA or your amount of DNA that you have from a human is quite limited that you're mostly

1231
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
You know pleiadian

1232
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:30,079
I looked closely the way you wrote your answers the way you wrote your book

1233
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
And my impression

1234
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
Is that your

1235
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,687
Probably

1236
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:40,319
I don't know if you say 90% gladion or when you know what your DNA kind of

1237
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:46,207
That's what I'm getting I'm getting She carries you the woman

1238
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Cherry juice

1239
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:52,863
For a certain. Of time and then gave birth to you but in reality you weren't really

1240
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
First

1241
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,471
For genetic line necessarily now you can correct me I want to just

1242
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,335
This is where I'm going

1243
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
What's the CIA motivated

1244
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,943
To attract you to get you into the Marines

1245
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:12,831
So you would be shot down eliminate you because you were the most dangerous of the 30

1246
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,623
If you want to look at it like that

1247
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:19,487
Hyundai

1248
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Semi

1249
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,839
Step sort of you seeing red

1250
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
Just because I want to pause

1251
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
Before we

1252
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
She is just

1253
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Creating

1254
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,775
An entire Theory

1255
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,871
This whole thing this episode this is like okay so really what's going on

1256
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:42,271
Your potential as a dangerous

1257
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,367
Knew that if you went to Vietnam you would be shot down in this helicopter

1258
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:50,207
Engineered the whole thing to try and get you killed

1259
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,511
You're an angel being

1260
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
Some sort

1261
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
She spits

1262
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
2 spelling

1263
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,935
Prophesying whatever you want to call it so

1264
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
They could have set that up

1265
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:06,335
And obviously Pleiadians to be watching over you your entire time

1266
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:11,967
It doesn't make any sense that they would just ignore you so so

1267
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:17,599
They actually rescued you from a life death situation and anybody else would have been killed

1268
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
God knows

1269
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
I still carry the scars today from that battle

1270
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
The real quick that's another trademark

1271
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
Eddie page

1272
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
It's not answering the

1273
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
Almost immediate

1274
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Talkin about

1275
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Bullets

1276
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,151
It doesn't bother me

1277
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,991
So if you hear what I'm saying right

1278
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,343
So do you think that they they were hoping maybe you would die

1279
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,231
I really truly think so

1280
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,351
No I don't think so

1281
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
I know so

1282
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,983
Find happy when I appreciate that I appreciate

1283
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,871
Sounds like the end

1284
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Thank you

1285
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
You makeup

1286
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,735
Absolutely

1287
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
That is

1288
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,647
Me reshaping your your myth

1289
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,207
Because I have

1290
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231

Destroyed you in Euclid

1292
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,351
Alright now we can

1293
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,167
Now we can proceed now that the dominance

1294
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,471
A hierarchy is very clear

1295
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Cherries on top

1296
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
Eddie is

1297
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
And you know why.

1298
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
Cookie Queen B

1299
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
She's she's no slouch

1300
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:53,599
Doing this for how many years now

1301
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,439
That's all

1302
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,743
Novice this is the big time

1303
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:06,143
This is a big league pickup basketball game Ophelia live

1304
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Bears Eli

1305
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
No

1306
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Carrie's going to

1307
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
Spell it out

1308
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,287
YG

1309
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:19,199
I'm not your usual interviewer and I have very sophisticated Witnesses

1310
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:23,295
Such as Captain Mark Richards who was in the secret space program

1311
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,343
Around the same time as you

1312
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,671
Maybe even love you

1313
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
He's in the six

1314
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:36,607
So anyway and he and his father were the secret space program so we had

1315
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,911
We have

1316
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:43,263
We have a Ryan vehicles that that they built

1317
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,335
All of this was going on we were not just some

1318
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Earth

1319
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
Civilization

1320
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Going to stop

1321
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,527
You were already you have you said above

1322
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,807
President

1323
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Level

1324
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Then

1325
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,999
And you were when you were from another planet for God's sake

1326
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
Planet politics

1327
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
Dealing with there

1328
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
Faces on the moon and Mars

1329
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
I think

1330
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,287
New recovered memories

1331
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,663
Efforts to establish civilizations on other planets

1332
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:27,039
This is the real kind of way that I would think that you would be useful

1333
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,599
Is it is in educating them

1334
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Capacity

1335
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,535
Tell me tell me

1336
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,143
There's a window you crawl out of

1337
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,799
They don't control me

1338
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
Alright don't

1339
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,087
Did they use me in a weapon or night

1340
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
Cassidy

1341
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
Exactly what I was

1342
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
Pull up doing

1343
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,751
Inaugurated the education

1344
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
Catholic Church

1345
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,711
Inaugurated them into education

1346
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Into education

1347
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
Interesting way of saying

1348
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Cold

1349
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,439
I don't man look at a note to me is just another like I'm not answer

1350
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
Your question

1351
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,791
But also like I said that's the window you

1352
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,863
You can get out of its above-top-secret I can't tell you about this

1353
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,447
She's offering him the window out like the you-know-what like

1354
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
Detective does or whatever is

1355
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
That's what's going on here

1356
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,383
And he reject that f****** window he's like no one controls me

1357
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,711
This isn't like she's not trying

1358
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
For a crime so you should have taken my window

1359
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,831
There's no consequences to going out that window

1360
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:11,231
It actually helps your story

1361
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,607
To punch up your dumpster

1362
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
Controls we stuff

1363
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,679
You worked for the agency

1364
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,983
It said that they were controlling you

1365
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,335
Do you want to do or what you can

1366
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
Redo the whole thing's ridiculous

1367
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,943
I want to ask you a question

1368
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Do you think

1369
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
The Eddy page

1370
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Which has been to area

1371
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
I think

1372
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
He had a dream

1373
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Interest vision

1374
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
Here is what he

1375
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,511
I want to give you a lot more credit

1376
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,839
A lot more than you're letting on here

1377
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:03,711
Well in the book you said you hadn't been that yeah

1378
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:20,351
So he pulls out a lanyard shouldn't carrier ID

1379
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:25,471
Basically if you're the Comedy Festival the passes

1380
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,359
Indeterminate writing on it it doesn't

1381
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
51

1382
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:38,783
Carry it around with you everywhere you go now Area 51 people are totally cool with you just wondering around

1383
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,023
Well about Area 51

1384
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,071
But he's been there

1385
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,631
Also if he is an archangel

1386
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,703
I'm sort and half

1387
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:02,591
It's going on underneath that museum about

1388
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:06,175
You got to help out with the Getty nobody

1389
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,967
That's an old rule

1390
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:10,015
See that's what's so fun about these like

1391
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,367
These people is imagining that they're all not like

1392
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,695
Because they're all like imagine that they're all not lying it's

1393
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,975
Crazy that they don't team up

1394
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:25,631
It's crazy that they don't all make make a Super Friends event

1395
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
Look Project Camelot cinematic

1396
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:36,639
Exactly you can't have them for every movie

1397
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
For Carrie to have around

1398
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,975
See what's going on with you

1399
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,255
The Reptilian

1400
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
Boy

1401
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:00,959
Even if he had at least

1402
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,519
Maybe didn't get those memories back

1403
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,687
Have you come back

1404
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
She might have

1405
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,551
She might as well that one under the rug

1406
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,599
Maybe I don't trust that one

1407
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,439
Still I still recall I think the spider leadership was

1408
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
In Plan B at

1409
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
The giant beetles

1410
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
I think are just

1411
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,167
That one guy right now

1412
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
Think I was struggling

1413
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Yeah that wasn't a good one

1414
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,615
I hate to say that

1415
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
But

1416
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
It really

1417
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
We can't do that up

1418
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,247
Episode will never happen

1419
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
There Beatles

1420
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,063
So

1421
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
You might be wondering what

1422
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
Like specific information

1423
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,927
Eddie wants to

1424
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
To get out here on the

1425
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,487
Michelle

1426
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,791
Control that part is definitely

1427
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
A piece of

1428
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,935
Messages

1429
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,471
He's not God

1430
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,055
I should tell you that one of the reasons I gravitated towards this video

1431
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,847
It's cuz it was the new newest one

1432
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
Okay that she's done

1433
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,663
And also it had to do with his

1434
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Prophecy

1435
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,991
Yes in Prophecy

1436
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,087
Alright I'm interested to hear that

1437
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
Challenges week ago

1438
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:28,255
Getting ready to happen

1439
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,095
Vague

1440
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Facebook

1441
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,447
And I told people what was about to happen

1442
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,639
I was awoken and I was given to court

1443
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
Identification need to give those on my show

1444
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:58,463
Literally the same day that we did the show happened to be later in the morning on the same day that you gave that

1445
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Mothership

1446
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:15,103
So there they must be coming obviously and you also talk about this I'm going to get my

1447
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,895
Forget we call it but it's a black

1448
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:23,551
Craft and it's very diabolical you said there's seven of them other than positioned around our planet for a very

1449
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,647
It doesn't surprise me

1450
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:34,303
These are new Ships coming in that you're talking about so it sounds like they're getting ready for some

1451
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Something big

1452
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,911
Alright

1453
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:44,031
Okay that's very cool so that's the one that you were describing the black

1454
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:55,039
There is 78 around the world

1455
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,303
I still don't believe it

1456
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,351
But also don't worry about him different

1457
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,399
Okay good

1458
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,959
So like one over Denver ice

1459
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
And then

1460
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Buenos Aires

You know what the one thing that we don't hear about this

1470
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
Nobody's ever mention Australia

1471
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
No

1472
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,847
No ever mention

1473
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
Left alone in the

1474
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,711
Please revive a lot on

1475
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,503
Let's

1476
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,111
As you can see when you don't have it flushed out you going this is what happened

1477
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,743
In the lab late at night with pain

There's a there's a bunch

1481
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,751
Pleiadian mother ships that are coming

1482

Courseplus these robot weapons

1483
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
Better like spaceships

1484
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:29,247
Plus all the other Alyssa ever get every other person also has

1485
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,319
Alien robots coming around and hanging out in our airspace

1486

We make peace with our enemies

1490
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,247
I'm seeing all that scary if we

01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
Discount all the other guy

1492
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,087

Friendly robot weapon only

1494
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,695
It's not so bad now that's

1495
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
But

1496
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
Not all good news

1497
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767

01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
And

1501
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
They're getting ready for what appears to be a kind of a standoff

1502
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:29,151
Or an out-and-out war and this war has happened on Earth before

1503
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,175
As you say

1504
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:34,271
We know that you say Sodom and Gomorrah

1505
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
Real quick he is argumentative

1506
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,855
Sodom and Gomorrah got new

1507
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,695
Okay I thought you was talking about the World Cup

1508
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:46,815
We have a war every four years or so.

1509
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Obviously

1510
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
Obvious

1511
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,143
Volkswagen

1512
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,423
Call Who's real name

1513
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
Egypt

1514
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
I've been to Egypt quite a bit and

1515
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
About it

1516
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,943
So there's a place called amarna and it looks like a nuclear bomb hit it

1517
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,991
Because it's been

1518
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:09,855
Instead of the you know the remains of you know these temples and so on

1519
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,183
There's virtually nothing on the desert floor it's clean

1520
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:20,095
So you know the only thing that would do this to a civilization that used to be there

1521
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Is a new

1522
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:27,775
Not the area also and I know so the signs

1523
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
The nuke is very clear

1524
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,103
I think you know a person doesn't

1525
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,199
I didn't have to have some CIA guy tell me that it was just obvious

1526
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,247
That's kind of a day

1527
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
Still probably have an expert

1528
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,575
That's kind of a dick

1529
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,855
Addictive

1530
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,767
Something else that I don't understand

1531
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
It seems very out of place

1532
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,375
The way she said that I love

1533
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,423
Reveal the limits of

1534
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
They're imagine a

1535
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:03,103
Like it like with l.ron Hubbard alien still

1536
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
B-52 bomber

1537
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
And of course it's a new can either Interstellar traveling and all the best

1538
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:19,231
Smarter idea to just throw one of those ships into the ground

1539
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:28,959
It's

1540
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,519
Yeah I am

1541
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
Don't think about that

1542
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,639
Also she also later

1543
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,687
Says that the Raptors are working with the Air Force

1544
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,015
Let me think about Rafters and B-52 bombers

1545
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:47,135
Which is a really funny thought

1546
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,351
So this is real and and usually have worn the CIA about this in your prophecies the fit when you were regressed

1547
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
That there's going to be another

1548
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,447
Nuclear confrontation

1549
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,239
With off-planet race

1550
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,799
Instead of the Middle East

1551
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,639
If I understand you correctly you're saying is going to happen in America

1552
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:21,951
Well you dare ever again okay well then

1553
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,535
Is Retin-A happen in this Armageddon thing

1554
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,119
It's not a new that they're paranoid over

1555
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:48,063
May I call you my sister

1556
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,183
Whoa come from a very source

1557
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:59,583
He doesn't want to answer the question

1558
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:05,983
He just went Whole Hog that. That's how we escape so much

1559
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:12,383
Therefore I know that

1560
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:18,783
How did I not

1561
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,415
Q only invited

1562
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,303
Apparently they don't like my bad language

1563
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,887
Mariah Carey

1564
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,215
Gary levox

1565
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,543
Like

1566
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
Catch this the first time I listen

1567
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,127
When I was cutting clips

1568
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
Kind of got it like I thought he was just

1569
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,223
Lili dodging

1570
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
Oh yeah

1571
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,807
I thought that was for sure what he was doing but

1572
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
Immediately says this

1573
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,879
And I didn't realize that this was him

1574
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,903
Sword of answering

1575
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
The question

1576
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,255
But you need to stall a little bit so you did that you're pleiadian thing

1577
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,559
But then he said this and I thought this was just

1578
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
I didn't realize that this was

1579
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,399
Tired of answering the question of

1580
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
What is the threat

1581
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
If it's not a nuke what is

1582
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Yeah

1583
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
In this place

1584
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,784
Dragon

1585
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
It is going to be a very very traumatic

1586
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Experience

1587
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,704
Everybody

1588
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,776
And everybody around the world

1589
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,592
If we were not here to help

1590
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,384
The creation

1591
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,224
Man and I don't care what color you are

1592
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,600
That's weird there at the end

1593
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,696
No I really didn't mean to throw and race

1594
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:07,840
Ego doesn't matter what color you are or my personal feelings

1595
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,912
Towards you

1596
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Call

1597
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
Hold on hold on

1598
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
You could have got

1599
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:21,408
I don't know when you put that one in if you're going to go with the race stuff that one

1600
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:26,016
Dragon world's going to be able to

1601
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,808
Whole world

1602
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:31,392
Big dragon

1603
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,976
To where the dragon is currently

1604
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,840
Questions will be answered but did you have any other questions

1605
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,864
Not dragon or Ray

1606
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
Race-related

1607
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,032
Don't understand what the difference

1608
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,312
Between loving sign

1609
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
And regular sign

1610
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Currently

1611
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,504
Non loving scientist their ones that would create things that are

1612
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,344
Okay I don't know I need loving scientists are all about the red dress

1613
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,928
Traditionally thought of

1614
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,976
The lightbringer

1615
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Alien race

1616
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,560
Yes they're the ones who give us are happy

1617
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:14,656
Supposed to nightmare

1618
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,752
I'm sure that are helpful as opposed to

1619
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:23,872
To kidnap us in our sleep like the grey has four chocolate bars

1620
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,456
Right

1621
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
Doodle

1622
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Texas forever

1623
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,976
This is this is the moment

1624
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:42,560
See there's going to be a space War dragons

1625
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:48,960
In the middle of a little bit of a war

1626
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,240
Got to worry about it

1627
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
The fire breathing dragon

1628
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,080
Which will learn about in a minute

1629
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,896
No homegrown fire-breathing dragon

1630
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,456
Prepared

1631
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,552
Sadistic draft picks

1632
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:07,392
Situation that's what I need to know

1633
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,328
Do you really know who you're

1634
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,352
Ambulance

1635
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,936
Well I think I do

1636
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,848
What are you just saying

1637
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
What do you mean

1638
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,432
Play that one more time

1639
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,112
You really know who your

1640
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,136
Interviewing

1641
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,720
Well I think

1642
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Alright

1643
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,608
You just threatened the Killer

1644
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
It's

1645
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,192
It is a threat

1646
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
It was generally

1647
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,712
Of all the people I've ever seen her interview no one's been like

1648
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
With right now

1649
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,344
Arrest

1650
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,672
From the absolute Beatdown he had in the first half of the

1651
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,120
I think he's trying but unfortunately

1652
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,192
Carrie immediately smacks him back down with this

1653
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,384
Issue with some of the language you use which seems to swear that you are not

1654
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Favorable towards

1655
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,432
People of color

1656
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:38,784
And I and that goes against my grain

1657
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
Carolina collision

1658
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
Brody Jenner I'm from a race of benevolent aliens or just turn out to hate

1659
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:03,104
Black people who got is that a weird alien

1660
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,200
Living in North Carolina

1661
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
Oh dear

1662
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,088
Credit on his book

1663
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,904
She's referring to stuff that she's right in his book I believe

1664
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
She's referring to

1665
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,024
They give the inside any of this

1666
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
Episode

1667
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
Perhaps he's had some

1668
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
Disparaging stuff in Atlanta

1669
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
What you talkin about the language of you

1670
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
I think that means

1671
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
Facebook

1672
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
Disparaging things about

1673
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,800
Either

1674
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
Caught that s***

1675
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:40,224
Which which I don't care what race you are probably

1676
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
You know we've uncovered some

1677
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
Pretty lady

1678
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,600
Sandwiches Amman

1679
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
I'm curious party

1680
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,208
But the fact that she's just going for it being like look

1681
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
To tell you I don't

1682
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,304
I'm not okay with the racism b u

1683
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Which

1684
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,376
Hypocritical bulshit

1685
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,936
It is hypocritical bulshit on her part

1686
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:05,056
His wife if she actually believes in all of these aliens

1687
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,104
Hugely rapist

1688
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
To so many

1689
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,784
Everybody with a broad brush these people are all evil

1690
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,024
Tasmanian devil

1691
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,376
Are good mongoose

1692
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,680
Cassowaries out there

1693
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,960
They will f*** you up

1694
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,752
Birds are evil

1695
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:40,128
I kind of agree with you but at the same time we live in

1696
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,944
Right so it's funny that she's calling one of

1697
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,552
Just a f****** racist

1698
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,600
So here's his response

1699
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,744
But send me your comments are are really difficult

1700
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
Text

1701
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
The dresser

1702
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Call the races

1703
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,312
I studied the Civil War intently and College

1704
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,360
PetSmart

1705
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,944
Race relations with white people and black people

1706
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,736
That's a good

1707
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,808
Learn

1708
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,600
Paperwork

1709
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
Accused of

1710
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,952
Real quick will get back to that in a second when did you go to college

1711
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
Funeral

1712
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,816
Years between

1713
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,840
16 + 18

1714
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,912
I don't care what are you studying race relations

1715
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:41,312
Most of the time most of the time you can't even if you graduate early from high school you can go to college in

1716
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,104
Until your class would have graduated

1717
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,200
Usually have to take correspondence classes and I don't think that would be a way you could have gotten an a

1718
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,480
Degree by the time

1719
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:54,880
He would have enlisted in gone off to Vietnam

1720
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:01,280
By the way is also segregated

1721
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,096
Maybe he went to college during that

1722
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,888
Not explain

1723
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704
Natalie on the GI Bill perhaps

1724
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
Just curious.

1725
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,872
We're going to be

1726
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
Franklin

1727
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,808
From creation

1728
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,888
Has the label things today

1729
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
Oh God

1730
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
One time

1731
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,624
Embrace

1732
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,440
And then help these less fortunate

1733
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,608
Weird is weird

1734
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,960
Well he doesn't mean that stuff at the end

1735
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,544
I don't understand how we went from

1736
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,592
There's Dragon coming to like

1737
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:25,248
Standard old racist in North Carolina fair with other drugs

1738
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Drunk old white bunnies like

1739
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,368
Well you know the problem is with it the way they live

1740
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
We were not even

1741
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,696
I'm close to done with how bad this one

1742
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,024
Can't imagine how we could buy this one off the rails

1743
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,888
And here we have hit the penny

1744
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
But it's still on it

1745
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Still upright

1746
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:52,128
Bakersfield classifieds

1747
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
Decent thought I guess

1748
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
He had at the end of like

1749
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
This country didn't

1750
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,064
We do a better job of helping

1751
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,648
People Express

1752
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,232
There's existed in this country since the beginning and all day

1753
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,792
He could do that and maybe save it but unfortunately

1754
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,608
How can you even

1755
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
Creating sense of mine

1756
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
How can you even focus

1757
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,984
Sun color of skin

1758
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:23,360
Why does that even factor into your kind of view of so-called Armageddon

1759
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:30,016
Attitude

1760
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,624
Tidy color

1761
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
Mini mini

1762
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,512
Genetics

1763
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,792
Andy creation

1764
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
Creation story

1765
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
Can I look weird

1766
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,712
The creation story

1767
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Actually began

1768
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
Can I say

1769
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,208
Evolve

1770
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,000
That is not true

1771
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,544
Who are the black people

1772
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,320
Oh no

1773
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,856
What

1774
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:42,208
Oh no

1775
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,328
You know what the machine gave him the other like

1776
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,376
Hey you're an alien

1777
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:53,984
The f*** are you so petty and talking about

1778
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,056
Pleiadian benevolent wonderful

1779
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
You still think of this

1780
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
Lotto benevolent

1781
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,640
Turns out no

1782
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,944
You know what just what I want

1783
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,552
I forgot to say stuff like this if profit

1784
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,320
Stroke

1785
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:19,840
I would gather if we talked to most of them

1786
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,632
Epsom salt

1787
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:28,288
Well the Bible called them the cursed race

1788
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:33,408
I've always thought of the black people as well the Bible calls

1789
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,184
Lock them out of my beautiful country that I mean alien but I'm still in America

1790
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,744
Also that's the amazing part about this country

1791
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,768
Is if you're white

1792
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:52,864
Even if you're an alien but like an actual layout

1793
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,680
Define also I specifically think that that's

1794
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
In the Mormon bible

1795
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,520
I'm not sure if that's in the Christian

1796
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
I'm not a hundred percent sure

1797
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,896
I think I agree with you

1798
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,944
I know for sure it's in the Mormon Buy

1799
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,528
No no

1800
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,832
India what I don't either

1801
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,880
Memorize the Bible and it's been a long time

1802
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,184
Pick one up but I don't recall

1803
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,464
Necessarily

1804
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,744
Black people are cursed

1805
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:23,328
Felix judeo-christian Bible

1806
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:28,192
I feel like I've been many times that I've read the Bible I would at least have seen that

1807
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:34,848
Once and been like four people would constantly bring it up

1808
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,408
And if that's the case then he's operate

1809
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
Hillbilly more

1810
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,832
Hillbilly Mormon angel

1811
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,624
TV show

1812
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,928
Stars Nathan Fillion weed plucking

1813
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,512
So now Carrie tries to save a little bit by using

1814
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
Really faulty etymology

1815
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,168
Okay and Humanity are is are a race of

1816
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:03,264
Warriors and a Rainbow Warriors

1817
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,080
And they are of multiple colors

1818
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:09,152
And has a r a

1819
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,200
Also called

1820
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Many colors

1821
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,624
WhatsApp

1822
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:24,256
So you're not descended from Wrecking 8

1823
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,048
This is like so stupid

1824
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:28,096
Wait what

1825
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:33,728
What's the weather

1826
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,224
No discussion of it except for Eddie to laugh and yellow mango

1827
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:48,576
Okay at least they found their middle ground

1828
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,600
Alright

1829
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,368
Alright

1830
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,000
The language works.

1831
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
Achoo as in Grant

1832
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
And man as in

1833
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:01,120
Man Hugh Grant is very attract

1834
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
That Rick's just

1835
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
Absolutely

1836
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,496
I believe the etymology of

1837
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,288
Hugo's

1838
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,640
I had the specifics pulled up about it just

1839
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,408
Just to be really fat

1840
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
But who cares

1841
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:17,248
Obviously

1842
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,088
So you kind of thinking

1843
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:27,488
You know like where he'll take the word and

1844
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,816
Conversion yet that's not how this works

1845
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:34,400
I'm out of that

1846
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,960
In the language on her like

1847
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:43,104
Calendar like inspirational calendar those quotes more likely she just wants out

1848
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Of this

1849
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,432
Stretch of the conversation

1850
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,480
And chooses like all right look at that

1851
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,016
What would you know about English

1852
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:56,672
Do that sort of thing Carolina and he's only been to college

1853
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,328
Incel and help

1854
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
He's got to go he's like

1855
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,216
That could have been the moment where Carrie takes us out of the muck right

1856
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,776
Greener pastures but unfortunately

1857
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,848
Kicking lucky

1858
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
Just keep taking

1859
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
Self till he falls over

1860
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,088
He was responsible for

1861
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
Oh God

1862
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:27,904
Eddie

1863
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Eddie

1864
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
Eddie

1865
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
Hitler

1866
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:36,096
A bad rap

1867
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:40,192
What are you doing

1868
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,616
Which apparently is a lot of racist stuff we have to call it out

1869
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,688
But he does not claim to be a half-alien

1870
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:55,040
Not where I expected this to go

1871
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:58,624
Chevrolet of all the things that we've

1872
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:04,768
I never expected it to descend into weird old racist who grabs you after a comedy doesn't that

1873
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:08,352
You know what you're really funny let me tell you about all the races

1874
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
Just things that I have to say

1875
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,656
I'm not racist

1876
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
Per se

1877
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,240
What are you hate look

1878
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,800
Are you cool if I tell you a joke

1879
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,848
It gets a little razor

1880
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:24,992
Little you might want to anyways

1881
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,272
F****** idiot

1882
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
Hardcore

1883
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
Holocaust

1884
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:33,696
Denying well

1885
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,304
But that's how most holocaust-denying statements

1886
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
Start

1887
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,608
He doesn't actually end up like

1888
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,376
Talking

1889
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
Too much

1890
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Details about what

1891
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
Hitler gets blamed for that he didn't do

1892
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,776
Which is maybe good for Carrie

1893
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,824
But like

1894
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:54,688
That was all just $2

1895
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,480
Oh God so we take a break

1896
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,760
From this vicious race

1897
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:04,160
Hey Matthew Savages about Holocaust denial

1898
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:07,488
How is it this is somehow going to come down

1899
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,280
Trans people shouldn't use the

1900
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:15,680
Same bathroom as their gender is weird old man

1901
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:33,600
The world is right here in America

1902
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
It's called Yellowstone

1903
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
Real quick

1904
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:41,792
Many movies have been made about Yellowstone

1905
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,840
He's talking about the supervolcano

1906
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,656
Which is something that Hollywood could never have imagined

1907
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,704
Even though there's been a ton of boogers

1908
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
At least 50

1909
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,592
Even though he's also called Hollywood

1910
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
Bright

1911
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,200
It is

1912
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
Rumbling

1913
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:06,624
I don't care what the scientists say 08 the last reference 670

1914
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,720
I dream the future

1915
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:16,352
And I've seen this so I agree with you absolutely

1916
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,144
Example of explicit

1917
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:31,200
Revolve

1918
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,480
Not defected like

1919
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,808
He's dreamed it so it's also true

1920
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
If this is the History Channel

1921
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,136
Normal scientist

1922
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,160
Stephen warned about the

1923
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,208
Possibility

1924
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
Clearly on people's radar

1925
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,072
And because of that people studied it very closely

1926
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,912
And there's literally no indication that we need to be worried about that at present

1927
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,728
Maybe it's sometime in the next Thousand Years

1928
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,664
That episode from 2009

1929
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:11,392
Figured I have to worry about there's really no indications that there's a threat here

1930
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Hundreds

1931
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
Poster

1932
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,976
Be able to tell any kind of

1933
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:18,304
Preliminary

1934
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,704
Does go off it is a potential Extinction event for not just us but like all life on the planet so

1935
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
But we figured it would be a smart idea to keep it

1936
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
Can I on it

1937
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:33,920
Decades and decades studying volcanoes

1938
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Just say

1939
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:40,320
Fully know what the warning signs are in that conference

1940
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,368
It's not like the 1800's were things really

1941
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,392
Makeup on us

1942
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:46,976
Probably

1943
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
Navigate back to

1944
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,304
When you put gas come out

1945
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,120
Read every word in there and yeah

1946
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
Read the book

1947
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
And see that

1948
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:07,456
Well

1949
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,736
Is because

1950
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,808
Sometimes hard to swallow

1951
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,088
Holyshit

1952
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,904
That's not even

1953
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,184
Nope

1954
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,512
Cuz the truth sucks sometimes

1955
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
Sometimes

1956
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:26,144
According to Mead

1957
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,128
Wooboi

1958
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,784
I love it I'm on

1959
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,320
Wow

1960
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,904
Facebook

1961
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:53,024
Doctors in there

1962
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,328
It's not everything

1963
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
About his whole life

1964
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
It's about the

1965
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,400
The Palladium

1966
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,168
About how

1967
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
Nobody

1968
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,032
Text Big MB more by black

1969
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Then he has

1970
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:09,408
Absolutely there's no black person who's been victimized by The Red Dragon

1971
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
There's probably something

1972
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,992
Think about how Martin Luther King

1973
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
Easy

1974
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,040
Almost there

1975
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,344
Some of these nice racist things that Alex's

1976
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Oh yeah

1977
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,464
We have two more Clips ones racist ones not

1978
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,512
We'll deal with it not racist

1979
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,560
It's about how I

1980
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
World

1981
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
Got countdown

1982
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,104
It's actually a prayer

1983
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,528
It's mentioned in the Bible

1984
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,808
Story

1985
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
Carrie

1986
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,672
The Sixth Seal was open

1987
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
At midnight

1988
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
2000

1989
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,864
Very complete record of things that happen

1990
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
Within

1991
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
36

1992
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
Dallas actors

1993
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,240
You're knocking Chan

1994
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,776
Amadeus

1995
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,104
What a Sally

1996
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,576
It started meal Farm

1997
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,624
That dragon

1998
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
Wake up

1999
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,184
Swine

2000
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,976
Yellowstone

2001
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:31,584
Is starting to become very very little not starting it's getting more and more

2002
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
It's not fan

2003
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,936
Me at all

2004
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:42,336
Did someone said a prayer to Amadeus and then woke up this morning

2005
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,664
Convince me

2006
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,456
That the scientists are wrong

2007
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
Yellowstone

2008
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,160
Of all the stuff that's happened

2009
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:01,024
Bible and the prophecies that he himself is fat

2010
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,816
Because he is an alien

2011
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:06,400
However aliens all Jesus died

2012
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,424
For their students

2013
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:11,008
Even though there are millions upon millions of years old

2014
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,824
Which means that all of them prior to

2015
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,592
To Jesus

2016
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,920
Who is still only a couple thousand years ago

2017
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:20,992
I don't understand

2018
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:27,392
Because they all reconcile the Bible with Drake I can actually

2019
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
Play mat

2020
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,208
Okay I wish I could throw

2021
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,280
I wish I could

2022
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:38,144
Because a lot of the people who take on these like alien ideas kind of Blended bitten off

2023
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,704
Exorcism into their their view of Christianity

2024
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
There's like that esoteric Christianity

2025
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:47,104
Describe another weird connection between

2026
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,944
The better answer is

2027
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
No you cannot

2028
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
You cannot reconcile those two

2029
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,552
Some holidays

2030
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,368
Pepper in whatever they feel

2031
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,672
Feel like we just talked a little bit like

2032
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:05,792
Everybody has their own recipe like he throws in racism I'm sure that's going to work well

2033
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,608
That's a long with his consistent

2034
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:09,888
Extra

2035
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,704
Use that

2036
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,984
There's bigger issues

2037
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,568
Himym throwing aliens

2038
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:20,128
Christ in together is not as important

2039
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,920
Tamiya necessarily as like

2040
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,504
Hey you're trying to Trojan Horse racism

2041
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
Into your intriguing

2042
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:29,856
Dragon metaphor about us volcano

2043
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
Do you think Holly

2044
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:34,208
Piggyback

2045
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,512
Some sort of authority in that you

2046
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
Came back from

2047
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,560
From the dead and 11

2048
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,352
Missing days in Vietnam

2049
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:44,448
Angel / 380

2050
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,472
Curse

2051
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,264
So are we

2052
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
Episode

2053
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
How he sort of Watch

2054
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
She probably

2055
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Should use

2056
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Is closing

2057
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,248
He defends himself about race

2058
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,784
Once again

2059
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:09,024
Holy crap

2060
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,096
Yeah he said some things about

2061
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,144
Righteous

2062
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,984
It's true

2063
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,312
I'm not going to tell you nothing that I cannot

2064
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:31,552
Is Dismount going to go out to break

2065
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,976
This book now and you're going to hear some

2066
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
Flagrantly racist things about minority

2067
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:45,120
And then you're going to say oh my God

2068
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,680
I doubt it

2069
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,544
It's a surprise to me as well I did not expect

2070
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
To say that

2071
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,384
But before this before this

2072
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,664
Episode was

2073
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,736
It taped on the 4th of July which

2074
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
Horses when we

2075
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
Declare our independence

2076
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:14,304
I believe every word there is nothing that he said that he cannot back

2077
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,888
We just found out the Jordans

2078
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,008
Hold the f****** phone you bigger

2079
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,312
Supposed

2080
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,336
Most willing

2081
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,664
See that's why I didn't want to tip my hand about the races

2082
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,200
Some stuff at the beginning of the episode

2083
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,760
But I wonder how much of that was coloring her like

2084
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:36,064
I'm going to take over the ship here

2085
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,344
I don't know if it was though

2086
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,368
I think that was just

2087
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,136
Incompetent

2088
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
Question

2089
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
Is Rambo

2090
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,976
But it's interesting to see

2091
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:46,304
Carrie like really take over an interview

2092
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,840
And then it's also really enjoy

2093
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,888
To have that box open

2094
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:52,704
But I'm sure she usually wants to stay close

2095
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
Because I think

2096
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,008
I don't know if I had

2097
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,544
In the clips that I played

2098
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,080
But when she was broken

2099
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
Subjective

2100
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,640
She does stay like

2101
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,224
There's some comments that you've made and people are going to

2102
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,504
To find them eventually

2103
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,088
Do we got to talk about that that's everything so it could have been like

2104
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:12,416
Sincerely her trying to allow him to do damage

2105
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
Control

2106
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:19,840
Punted just botched the s*** out of the damage control

2107
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:24,704
You got a safety that was

2108
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:27,008
That was a disaster

2109
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,688
If you said that then that means she's not even talkin about the book

2110
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,784
There's some other

2111
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,808
She said

2112
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,392
She said that there were some comments he's made me and they're going to come out

2113
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,976
You will come out being the book is going to

2114
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,608
All right side chica

2115
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,912
So I think that's what he's talking about

2116
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,704
This is not

2117
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,056
The Project Camelot world is just

2118
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
The tree you just

2119
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,128
Keeps giving weird fruit

2120
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,408
You know like it

2121
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,944
It's like you

2122
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,712
You get

2123
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,504
You put your hand into the bag

2124
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,040
And you don't know what you're going to get

2125
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:14,112
Are you going to get a murderer in prison line to a lady

2126
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,928
Pulling from the bag

2127
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,208
Are you going to get a gun

2128
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,744
A guy who believes

2129
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
The Thursday

2130
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,304
City under the museum

2131
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,608
Are you going to get it

2132
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,656
To be an elected official in now do you

2133
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,192
Who believes

2134
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:30,752
Has sex with an alien every now and again

2135
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
Once again

2136
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,568
The best

2137
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,848
Got that we've ever had

2138
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:41,248
South Park

2139
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,296
He seems like a really nice guy

2140
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,112
I don't remember his particulars I I don't think you're right

2141
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,392
I think he might have been that f******

2142
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,696
Alright

2143
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
Who could have

2144
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,024
When you pull your hand out this time which org

2145
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:53,792
Going to get it

2146
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,584
Like

2147
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,888
This guy saying super racist s***

2148
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:04,288
Disney broadcasting from a rocking chair if it's on the front of a goddamn Plantation

2149
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:08,128
He is very rarely looking up at the camera

2150
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,152
Start talking like this

2151
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:10,944
Very

2152
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320

2157
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704

2158
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,056
