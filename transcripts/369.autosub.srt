Airjordan.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge like I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
I need money

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Everybody likes it around

6
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Jones

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
We are

9
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
Jordan low top Jordan

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Do you have any

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Vendor like

12
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Meet

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
Hot dog

14
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
You know like you by shift

15
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
But is there anything

16
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Here

17
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Anything that stayed with you

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
No

19
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Traveled with no

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,648
My house burned down like 5 years ago instead of like I lost pretty much everything I own but events.

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
Me 5 years ago

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,512
You don't do this a lot of things

23
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
You don't keep a lot of things

24
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
That was even true before the fire

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Books

26
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Library

27
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,288
And I guess maybe some of those are like paperbacks I would buy

28
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
I'm not

29
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
Super interested in

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,320
Shopping number one if I'm walking around at somebody selling something I'm not

31
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,392
I'm not usually even considering it

32
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
What have you bought everything

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
Actually not outside of a

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
I think it was a street vendor when I was in

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Like

36
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
I've mentioned the past that I like

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
In high school I wore shein

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
An extension of that was shiny robes

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Woodside erodes marimba

40
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
They weren't really all that in play but I like that like

41
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Robe

42
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
My some of my family lives

43
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Lives in

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Like around the

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah it's a one time we went to visit

46
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
And my mom and I think

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't know why

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
And I got to Shawnee Road

49
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
That might have been

50
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Street vendor perch

51
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah shiny like a reflect

52
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Tavor like

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
Sequin sequin

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
Like light

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
A dragon

56
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Games on it and stuff

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Okay alright

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,392
Alright now that Cena that's what I wanted to get to the bottom I didn't want one of those soft

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Robes

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
Like a bathrobe wanting something really gaudy

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Over the top

62
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
That might have been but I don't know alright

63
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
That was probably when I was

64
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Yeah yeah

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Teen going on 12th century

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
Courtesan I called like that

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
I don't know much about either know I got to teach you

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
So Jordan today where did the present

69
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Still I was hoping

70
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
To maybe do something different

71
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
But I was

72
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Called into action

73
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Okay alright

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
November 13th

75
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
2019

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
And Ayana

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
Honestly think I would say this

78
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Before we do anything

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
I think that this episode is a

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Window in

81
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
A very perfect opportunity to

82
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,080
A lot of different elements of why Alex Jones is show is

83
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Disaster

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Any super terrible

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
Just perfect

86
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
The encapsulation

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Of many different Elam

88
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Okay I hesitate to call this a Rosetta Stone

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Kohl's

90
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
All these

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
But over the course of this episode I am going

92
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Highlighting

93
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Particular

94
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Behavior

95
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
Then Alex engages in

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Constantly

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,983
I think they're all on amazingly public display

98
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Alex commits

99
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Every egregious error that he

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
He commits usually one or two at a time

101
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Time-in other

102
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
Subway I don't want to put too fine a point on it because I

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
I don't think

104
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Is any kind of a unique Apple

105
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
I just think that

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
It's some of the

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Illustration

108
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
These Trends have behaviors

109
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Really

110
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
Flagrant

111
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
They provide a glimpse in

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Episode is a good

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
Encapsulation of why

114
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Looking at Alex

115
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
The pizza state

116
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
So anyway before we get

117
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Get to that Lexie

118
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
This sort of thing

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687

Dennis the Menace the childhood prankster grew up chicken policy walk little known fact

126
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
Next

127
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Three names

128
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
1

129
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Okay

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103

00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
I don't think people do this

137
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Florida soul maximillia

138
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
That it might who knows

139
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,335
Could be good be a youth could be 80 years old

140
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,895
Strictly an armor for role-playing game

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Pretend you know what age the walks are

142
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
OK Google

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039

Money off that heroin

00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Why you pimp so good

149
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,919
Is freakishly large

150
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Breakshit

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
All I can think of now is a hole dug

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Universe like Doug

153
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Iggy fresh

154
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Breakshit Doug

00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
Yeah you're a dougie something up there please feel

156
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:05,215
Able to do not a dougie something are you getting out of work so if you like we're going to website knowledge make that cam click the button that says Sports joke

157
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
So Jordan we begin today a little bit differently than normal that's early cuz I often don't play Alex's intro

158
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
Stride Rite but in this case

159
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759
The way he opens the show is

160
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Is actually different

161
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
I've heard in the pack

162
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Leaving up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones

163
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:39,775
So just right off the bat on the day that the public hearings for the impeachment inquiry

164
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Our beginning

165
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:47,199
That's a real bad Vibe for Alex start officer playing a voice saying that we are gathered here to overthrow the US government

166
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
That seems like a statement of purpose

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
More than anything else

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Do they

169
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
He doesn't normally

170
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,975
I have not heard of that drop being thrown in might be something

171
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
But I don't I don't remember it being a super regular thing

172
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Yeah that would be funny but if Alex Jones

173
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
That's it that's like a

174
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
He's literally talking to

175
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
To the oath keeper

176
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,455
Well I suppose you can make the argument that he's saying that this is the statement of purpose of his enemies

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
He's fighting against that overthrow the government I guess you could

178
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
That's convoluted for him

179
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Either way it's

180
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
Super interesting where that audio come

181
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
This is one of the most

182
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Notable early fake voice recording

183
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Spooked sound like someone else

184
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
In this case it was designed to sound like

185
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Carl Steiner

186
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
The former commander-in-chief of the US Special Operations

187
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
A scientist named George Apopka

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
You took

189
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
A 10-minute sample of Steiner's voice

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
And created fake audio of him talking

191
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
About overthrowing the US government

192
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
That fake audio was so convincing that Steiner himself

193
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
I asked for a copy of it

194
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
No

195
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
There's

196
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,183
There's an interesting siematic in

197
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Alex is trying to evoke fears of government overthrow in his audience whether it's

198
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
The globalist overthrowing the government and his audience

199
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
You know

200
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
To fight back again

201
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Or if

202
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
What whatever it is there's something he's doing with

203
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
If you was over throwing

204
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,151
Audio that he's chosen to heighten that mood

205
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Is specifically something that's fake

206
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
It's the product of misinformation

207
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,087
Whether or not it was benign and recreational in its

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Construction it still

209
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
A direct

210
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Fabrication

211
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
So he chose

212
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
What are the progenitors of Addie

213
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
Deepfake video

214
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
From the mid-to-late 90s

215
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
It's either that's very notable pesos

216
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
Know that that's fake

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Yeah yeah

218
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
It's like a whole f****** metaphor for everything that he does

219
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
He said it's purporting to be real information

220
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:05,695
Absolutely. Who knows if it's because of the context of it being thrown in with this

221
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Intro

222
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,631
Presented as if it is real there is obviously and I hope that somebody

223
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
People will hear that enjoy

224
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Just it'll trigger

225
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
Where overthrowing the US government

226
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
I meant some people might know what it is

227
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,895
Who knows I don't know what the point of it is but it's fascinating to

228
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
To me that even Alex's

229
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Intro choices are lies

230
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Everything is

231
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
It must be somewhere

232
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
It's an antonym

233
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
Interesting things that I am not entirely sure what the

234
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Performance

235
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
Poetry is yeah there's some

236
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
There's something

237
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Dematic

238
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
A wrinkle that I'm having

239
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Difficulty

240
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,727
Man I feel like there's some sort of foia request that we can have that will Revere Revere Electric

241
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
20 years of something Bowl on

242
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Easter eggs of how

243
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Full of s*** Alec

244
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
I don't know if the variable

245
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Turn off oil can help with that but

246
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:02,015
Maybe these lawsuits

247
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
So the impeachment inquiry has begun in the house

248
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
And Alex of courses just dismissed

249
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Very popular

250
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
For the right way

251
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
I wanted to check in on his show because of that

252
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
Cuz I figured that that's of monumentous thing

253
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
In the news

254
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
And Alex would have a take on it

255
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
His take

256
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Is not all that interest

257
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
But

258
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Something else

259
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
What 355 days out from this incredibly important

260
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Election

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,807
And now they got the official impeachment proceedings going on

262
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
In the House of Representatives as we speak

263
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
Authority highlights of Chef

264
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
Congressman Nunez the ranking Republican member that is all going to be coming up

265
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Today

266
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Dr. Steve pieczenik

267
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,959
No Delta Force CIA overthrow governments

268
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Really smart guy best-selling author

269
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Call Ryder

270
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
Tom Clancy

271
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
He is going to be

272
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Back on the broadcast that talk about the coup

273
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
No behind it and what he expects to come to help though

274
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
I worked out about that

275
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
Steve Outback nope

276
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
No refuse

277
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
I love it I cannot know

278
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
Steve is back about

279
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Holyshit what they talked about

280
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
I would say

281
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Headliner

282
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Steve is back

283
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Back is in all capital letters

284
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Couple of videos from his

285
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
YouTube channel apps

286
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Very concerned

287
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Learned about his

288
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
Like I thought he

289
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Deteriorating

290
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,599
He seems unwell. I'm not saying anything like

291
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
Conspiratorial like

292
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,743
Secretly got XYZ going on

293
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,863
Be pretty old his speech patterns are completely different than they are on Infowars

294
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
And I realize like now it's just cuz he's talking alone

295
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,287
He's back on the show and he sounds almost exactly like you always ask

296
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,663
He's eager for the yelling at Alex about stuff

297
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,039
Into webcam there's no photo for it I know it it doesn't have the same electricity

298
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Yeah so I'm kind of

299
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Happy on that level cuz it'll even if

300
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
I hate them

301
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
I think you sucks take no pleasure in the idea of like

302
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
I'm falling apart so it's nice to

303
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
To know that you still love

304
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
Pretty sharp my okay what you saying is people are still under estimating

305
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Federer after all these

306
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
At the end of the day

307
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
The top five

308
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
He and Ant-Man

309
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Steve

310
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
He's like

311
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,223
I can't I can't even like when he came on the show in 2013 and then

312
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Episode we heard

313
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Any declared himself in an open state of freezer

314
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Yes I was pretty

315
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Wild

316
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Keys in that

317
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Okay

318
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
Swinging okay so we got that to look for

319
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
But that doesn't happen for a while because Alex has got a

320
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
I Cover the Waterfront

321
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Got to get

322
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
The news

323
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
CMP

324
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Stuff is

325
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
And it is what it is it's all bulshit show trial

326
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
But there was a bigger story but

327
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Alex knows what it is

328
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
What the big enchilada

329
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Exactly as we said she would do it

330
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
Then we got to dig up potatoes from a year ago 6 months ago

331
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
A week ago

332
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
I I hit it

333
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
Perfectly hole-in-one I'm at just got to be honest with you

334
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
I just got inside the enemy Chad you can see Hollywood script

335
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
Hillary loses

336
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
She launches all the fake Russia investigation she wants to

337
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,871
Back out of those investigations he's running

338
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,711
She said she's not going to run while she collects money while she travels around the country

339
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
While he makes more appearances all this

340
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Canada combined

341
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
All she still runs the DNC and runs those conference calls

342
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
Then ride is the impeachment starts of trump

343
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Keisha the people are begging me

344
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
They're drafting Meowth or responsibility Trump so dangerous I don't want to do it but

345
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Okay I am well she said that

346
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
She said that she said she's running

347
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
No she did not she said she's running

348
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
She said she's not running

349
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
Yeah she left it open with the never-say-never self

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,903
Yeah and that there was something that you said when she was being interviewed on the BBC as part of her book tour

351
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
Who's going to run again and she replied I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many many many people to think of

352
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
But as of this moment sitting here in the studio talking

353
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
Sing to you that is absolutely not my plan

354
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Also in March she said quote

355
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
I'm not running

356
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Who knows no baby that's secretly her sexy

357
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
She's running

358
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
I've been pretty consistent in my position that Hillary is not run

359
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
But everyone f****** loves talkin about her running

360
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,783
People like Alex love talking about it because it Riles up their base

361
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Something created the perfect

362
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Easy villain and Hillary

363
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
People out on the last love talking about it because the idea that Hillary would run again proves everything they say about the Dems being

364
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
You stupid self.

365
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Defeating party

366
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,911
A very small number of die-hard Hillary folks still hanging on love talking about it because

367
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
They think that Hillary should run

368
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,799
Everyone gets something fun out of entertaining the idea of Hillary running

369
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
But I just don't think there's much

370
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Reality gear

371
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
I don't

372
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,663
Forget Hillary herself gets

373
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Something

374
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,759
Out of being exactly

375
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,063
Yeah I don't think

376
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
Alex could prove all the other cities

377
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
Hillary Gary either I have not had that bouquet

378
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Also

379
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,279
Why is it Alex completely freaking out about Bloomberg running

380
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Alex f****** hate

381
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Bloomberg

382
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
He's one of the globalist to attend to those meetings with Bill Gates

383
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Ted Turner and Oprah

384
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,311
Why is he spending his time obsessing with a possibility that Hillary is going to run while ignoring the reality that Bloomberg

385
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
He's running

386
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
The Bloomberg doesn't really move the needle with the audience

387
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Making them scared of the Clint

388
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Move product

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
So

390
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
He does

391
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
If Bloomberg

392
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Like

393
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Do all of these me

394
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Media organization

395
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Clara Brown

396
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
President

397
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Everybody on the

398
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Just don't

399
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,703
Stop a lot of people don't care as it's

400
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
Some people doing it's good to pay attention

401
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Did all candidates

402
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
Everybody

403
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
Oh yeah weather for Alex

404
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
Yeah you know you're right

405
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,623
Bloomberg no but it's right up there with like

406
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Okay

407
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,791
He has not said a damn word about Bolivia about the release of his buddies

408
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
Stephen Miller's email Bloomberg running

409
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Anti-heroes

410
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
F****** bone side down

411
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Hillary

412
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Secretly running

413
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
Hillary she's a has-been I know she's bi

414
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Democrat nominee

415
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
2000

416
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
1020

417
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
Unless we expose her and get out of head of it and put heat on her

418
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
She wants me to self candidate with none of her corrupt past brought up

419
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
And once they get the impeachment they're going to say that's the conviction

420
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
That's just the indictment the house

421
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
And then she's going to run out

422
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Before the end of the year

423
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Time table

424
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
She is saying she's going to retire she beat him in 2016 or she is

425
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
I feel a sense of responsibility partly

426
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
Because my name was on the more votes but ended up losing

427
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Also I think is

428
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
Really undermining our democracy in

429
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Very fundamental ways

430
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
I want to retire him I want to see him retired

431
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
When you kill a horse basically

432
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,031
Okay Alex conveniently and Zack clip

433
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Just the right spot

434
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Yeah after she says she wants to retire Trump Hillary explains that means she'll be helping the Democrats I'd come up with the best possible

435
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
Plan the interviewer Emma Barnett

436
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,319
Then she's going to run again and Hillary says quote

437
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
No

438
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Alex wants her to run so f****** bad

439
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Think of how

440
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Easy

441
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
Everybody's job would be if Hillary and

442
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Trump rant again

443
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,263
We can just read everybody would post this thing called a dystopian

444
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
No baby horrible

445
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
I like the idea of Hillary being the Stealth cam

446
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
It's so she doesn't get any

447
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Criticisms so nobody does any

448
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,295
Has any background

449
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
Go fuc yourself

450
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,927
I thought Rodger stone is telling you that was Michelle Obama what's going on here

451
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
Who's the self Canada

452
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Whatever you need that day

453
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
So this is

454
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Things happening for various

455
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Some people are

456
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
One perspective on it other p

457
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
People have a different one

458
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Alex is prospective

459
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,591
Seems to be that this is all Cuban odds Falls me

460
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
So that works is an interesting Tale

461
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
I like it a lot of people

462
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
What Alex

463
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Reese's cake

464
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Qanon

465
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
To me I can't really answer that question

466
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
It's buried over time

467
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
A lot of the underlying

468
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
BECU

469
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,975
Evacuation order things that Alex

470
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
And has

471
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Prior to qanon

472
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Right Alex has been

473
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Okay with it at some point

474
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Bitter about it at others

475
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
Trying to create his own version of it

476
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
At other times

477
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
But now in 2019

478
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Hey November

479
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
You seemed a bit salty

480
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
They may have lost the House of Representatives

481
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,087
The impeachment hearings that show many said would never come

482
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
Are now officially going on

483
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
10 minutes ago finished up

484
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,351
Is opening statements very powerful that I'm going

485
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Play

486
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
In its entirety this segment

487
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,423
And the next

488
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,519
He's the ranking Republican member on the house intelligence committee was the leader of it but

489
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
Thought we were Invincible in the 2018 midterms and

490
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
You told us we didn't need to even worry about it

491
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,711
Course we did

492
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,063
By the way we're not going to just have somebody that's

493
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
What's shadoweave today

494
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,440
Steve pieczenik of did co-found Delta Force with General

495
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
Schumacher and Boykin

496
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:26,400
So yeah I mean qanon gave a false sense of security to everybody trusts the plan

497
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,704
Feel invigorated to go and

498
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Keep the house

499
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
For the Republicans and now we got in a

500
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,408
Angry at soggy bulshit here on the show no he's got the real deal

501
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
He's got Steve pieczenik

502
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
F******

503
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,064
Craziest wingding liar

504
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
This side of the Mississippi

505
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
Okay I love that alright

506
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
So great

507
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
Crazy you have no idea how crazy

508
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Cute wasn't real

509
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,496
Neither Steve's backstory

510
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,592
This is wild so Alex has a radio show

511
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
A couple times

512
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
I will take you on

513
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
That's what we know about

514
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
The radio show

515
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
The TV show

516
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,136
But it turns out his secret plan behind the scenes

517
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Maybe self candidate

518
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
Not sure what his secret plans are

519
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,608
He doesn't need your money to continue these secret plan

520
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
In talking about how we need

521
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
Snooze

522
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
That's your recall

523
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
The previous special

524
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
Been running was the Everything Must Go sale

525
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:43,968
That went way too long longer than he intended

526
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,296
Sale just before the Everything Must Go sale

527
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
Was the Black Friday comes early

528
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
Special

529
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,232
His new special is the Black Friday it's very uninspiring

530
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,304
We got a lot of stuff going on in the background and I've got

531
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Plans and operations

532
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
That will keep this message on are no matter

533
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
How that railroad us

534
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,800
But it takes two things it takes Word of Mouth

535
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
And it takes money

536
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
And it takes a lot of both

537
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
Total War

538
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,248
People talk about all they're going to get their guns while shooting or someday

539
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:22,112
If you don't take action now you'll never take action of shooting war and we won

540
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
To avert

541
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
A shooting

542
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720

You said that as a joke

563
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
You said it's Black Friday sales then as a joke

564
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
With that actually what he's doing

565
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,432
Another early by Friday sale

566
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
That's what I would say

567
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
I appreciate

568
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Preciate the willingness to

569
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,648
A lot of people on the right

570
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,888
You tried to bring Hillary back cuz I can reduce reuse recycle

571
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,472
The Captain Planet planet of b*******

572
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,520
I like it I think that's great

573
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Y'all need to

574
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,896
Conserve bloviating die-hard

575
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Again or some

576
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
What is he going to sell on Black Friday

577
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
That's my queen

578
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
That's a great question Cyber Monday comes early

579
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
That's real Bass

580
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
To me what this indicates is

581
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:09,632
Probably his staff in that area of the business is also finding out

582
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
Whatever marketing people you may have been employing before are now an internal right

583
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
You also your video editor

584
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,736
So I see these is all kind of like little

585
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
It's circumstantial evidence certainly

586
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
There are things you would expect

587
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,600
Jeffy

588
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Crumbling as business

589
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
So I think that might be the

590
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Yeah Jon Hamm

591
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,976
Is it working

592
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Conformity

593
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
But you know what Hillary is run

594
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
She is on

595
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Off the 10 TV and radio programmes a day

596
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Armoire

597
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,032
Any speeches 7 days a week

598
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
He's running

599
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
He's collecting money

600
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
In our foundation

601
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
And you see that whole crew up there by dinar leeteuk

602
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
Bernie

603
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
Is gibbering

604
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,160
Why

605
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
They're all a big joke

606
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Tulsi gabbard

607
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Anywhere near

608
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,888
Why is she not a joke primaries are going to steal

609
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Just like I did from Sanders

610
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
4 years ago

611
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Alex I don't understand

612
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
You know he loves Tulsi

613
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
And whatever

614
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
Still kind of in a weird cult why is she in the dark

615
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
You can start that too much

616
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
In that area but it does seem to be very

617
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
Consistent thing among people I don't trust

618
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,256
Weird weird

619
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,072
Beyond that I think that Alex recognizes

620
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
He's in for a f****** world of hurt

621
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Is Bernie is a candidate

622
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,008
Because he made such a big deal out of Bernie Havoc Beats

623
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,336
Screwed over by Hillary in the primary last election

624
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,896
Bernie before

625
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
Alex realized he was a socialist or whatever

626
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,040
Spent a lot of time talking about he was one of the only

627
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
Brave people in the Senate because he stood with Ron Paul in terms of

628
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,256
Alexander Realty

629
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912
Any audience member of his with any kind of memory or actual concern about the issues that Alex

630
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
Rants about is going to be like

631
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,032
What about Bernie isn't the FED one of your big

632
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
Trademark issues with you on that why you care about this you know cultural

633
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:36,832
Nonsense let's say B presented

634
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
It's insane yeah he's going to have a really tough time with that

635
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
That's all I think he's

636
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Really

637
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
Hoping that that isn't

638
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,584
The primary really love it if if if Bernie lose

639
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,632
It doesn't even matter they can

640
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
Hillary probably torpedoed in there too they can

641
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Play that whole thing

642
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Exactly

643
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
They wouldn't give Bernie a shot

644
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
So unreasonable Saudi heard Alex

645
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
Bring up a story about British Hospital

646
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,976
I am there making a decision that if you racially or

647
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,792
In a sexist way abused members of

648
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
I'll give you a warning

649
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
If you say

650
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
Continue

651
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
The end it's safe to do so they will withdraw tree

652
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Treatment right

653
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
The two Edwards in your outro

654
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Basically

655
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Ya Ain't So Alex

656
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,384
Re brings up the story

657
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
But

658
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
Pay close attention to how he present

659
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Because this is very telling

660
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
Last week

661
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
That article

662
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
I want to know about it

663
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
The NHS shed

664
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,488
If you're alright winner and that's anything they choose. Bad

665
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,280
You're not going to get Healthcare

666
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
We're going to kill you

667
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Whoops

668
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
You really

669
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
You shouldn't say that

670
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
That's supposed to be the quiet fire

671
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
Right if I recall

672
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360
Out-of-the-loop Bristol

673
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
In the UK

674
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
That's

675
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
It's just it's not even

676
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:12,320
The entire area it's just it's Bristol I think it's a system

677
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Localize

678
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,696
Yeah that story is entirely about them saying

679
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
Their consequences were behaving and racist insects

680
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,120
Safeway store there say they hate the right-wing now huh it's about Behavior

681
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:31,520
Alex is reporting it is as if it's about denying care to right-wingers which is not a behavior it's a group identifier

682
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,896
You can kind of tell from this sort of thing the Alex believes that being a part of the group right-winger

683
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,992
It's some kind of connection with the behavior being racist or sexist

684
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
This is one of the more damning

685
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
Instances of Alex making an argument defending racist insects

686
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Disabuse being cruel to people

687
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
Book framing it is if he's just standing up for right-wingers

688
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
Alex is a coward

689
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,144
He wants people of ethnic minorities and women to shut up and deal with whatever comes their way but he doesn't

690
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
We can make his place in the market work if he's an open race

691
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,568
That fun game he plays we complained about the media attack

692
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,872
Come all the time by calling him a racist unfairly

693
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
Doesn't work out quite as well if he's honest about what he believed

694
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Pizza what he

695
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
So

696
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,064
So you see that sleight of hand

697
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
This is about denying care to right-winger right

698
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
No it's not racist

699
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
You are acting

700
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
That what

701
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,280
Wild

702
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
That he's

703
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Still bothering

704
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
I mean

705
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
There's nothing bad going to happen

706
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
Stephen Miller and

707
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Open Waze

708
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
He's been white supremacist

709
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,104
Forever but now he's just opened about it and he's free

710
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
I think that there is a acclimation

711
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,456
Listen. I think that Alex will be open

712
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Wants

713
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
You realizes

714
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
If you survive

715
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
On-air long enough

716
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
To get

717
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
To the point where he realizes like

718
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,952
I don't think I have any other options

719
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:57,280
What once the once once other avenues

720
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Of

721
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Possible money

722
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Aren't there

723
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
That's because that's what he is

724
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Cute figure

725
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
It's not like Steve Miller

726
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Get another job

727
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,616
Oh wait he Wilfred

728
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,152
Uni

729
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
Sure

730
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Absolutely

731
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
So this

732
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Kind of continued

733
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
Alex

734
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
Covering another culture

735
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,048
Issue and that has to do with the launch of Disney Plus

736
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
So here's Alex talk about this

737
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
2

738
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
Warnings being

739
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Disney movies

740
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Likely

741
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Because of

742
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Cultural

743
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
Just leaving

744
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
Just leaving

745
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
And with the

746
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Cats

747
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,280
Saying where we finding maybe there is milk nearby

748
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,632
Samuel C. Shane swimming around them around

749
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
Maybe they'll be had for you

750
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
And tail for me

751
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
Something wholesome and fun and good

752
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
So Alex is really missing the mark

753
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
Is it being like outdated cultural norms are that there is a man and a woman and a base

754
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,560
So with the release of Disney plus the company realize that there were a few issues of some of the movies they put out over the years

755
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Considering their first release

756
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Lease was put out in

757
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
1837

758
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,936
You got to understand that so

759
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Some cultural things

760
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,336
1937 was 5 years before our government Force Japanese-Americans into

761
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
The camps during World War II

762
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:52,480
Do 10 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball

763
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
It was 18 years before Emmett Till was murdered

764
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
18 years before the Montgomery Bus by

765
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,000
It's very hard to put into words how different the world we live in today from when Disney started putting out movie

766
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
A lot of those movies are beloved classic

767
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
But that doesn't change the fact that a lot of them are products of their time

768
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
In order to strike a balance

769
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
Instead of editing the movies

770
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Offensive scene

771
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Out

772
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
Just decided to answer morning so

773
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
Two people knew what they were getting into

774
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Princeton

775
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
Dumbo features Acro character named

776
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Jim Crow

777
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,528
Probably not a good look that one's a little bit on the nose

778
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
In Peter Pan they sing a song called what made the Red Man red I don't understand what the problem is there is Duty

779
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,560
We just thought people deserve a heads up on stuff like that as well as warnings about a ton of characters smoking

780
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
The movie

781
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,472
They were made back at a time when people talk cigarettes were healthy a Bugs Bunny used to smoke all the time

782
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,520
I love that shitt totally

783
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,872
The warning on the lady in the Tramp is because there were two Siamese cats

784
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
They're basically just racist Asian stereotypes

785
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
I wouldn't expect the guy Alex who's been putting out his own racist Asian stereotypes videos featuring fentanyl the Tiger

786
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
Dragon

787
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,464
To understand why a company might do this sort of thing as an embarrassing and regrettable thing of

788
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
People only

789
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
Wholesome entertainment like Alex's racist commercials I don't understand

790
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
I did not bring this up

791
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
But I'm going

792
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
Gaston Alex

793
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
Is furious that song of

794
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Isn't done

795
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,896
It's not on there at all man

796
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
You can find it

797
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
On YouTube though

798
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,576
I'm glad they did that but also we should update a lot of movies

799
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,672
Like the movie American Pie should have a warning on there that it's like

800
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,048
There was that he was attempting to broadcast

801
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
The movies from like

802
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
A few years ago

803
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,632
That is

804
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,912
Twenty-something years ago

805
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,960
That was a 2000

806
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm not minimizing

807
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,872
So you know the right right

808
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Yeah

809
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,528
So Alex pretends here that this next clip better the problem with the lady in the

810
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Is that there's a heterosexual

811
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
Couple

812
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
Okay presented

813
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
This is so stupid

814
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,816
Where job so right

815
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Nice

816
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
We just played

817
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,680
The trailer

818
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
For Lady and the Tramp

819
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
Three released

820
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
The classic film

821
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
You're not allowed to do that

822
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,664
That is hateful

823
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
That is homophobic

824
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
That is bad

825
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
Again

826
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Realtors you're really blessed

827
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,160
That you didn't just see

828
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
That level of bigoted

829
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Nazism

830
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
And I'm not joking

831
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
21-gun salute your universities

832
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
People also Taylor offended by

833
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Just everything

834
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,824
So in true Alex Jones fashion what we have here is a straw man

835
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,408
The reason is warning on Lady and the Tramp is the racist Asian depiction

836
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:05,248
But because Alex doesn't want to directly support things that most people recognize

837
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Is part of an ugly

838
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:11,648
We passed he's pretending the problem is the movie is at with movies and tells a heterosexual love story

839
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Is the complete s***

840
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:19,328
There's so many movies on Disney plus but to pick to heterosexual love stories that don't have worn it

841
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,984
That don't involve archaic racist stereotypes well as of Arden Disney fan I don't know if you can name one of

842
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
I don't know if their movies out the top of

843
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
This is such a gross

844
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Powder Valley

845
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
He knows that he has

846
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
Have to defend racism

847
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
That's what he does

848
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
What are you just can't do that

849
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,832
I would venture to say that at least 30% of his Conte

850
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
That could easily be summed up like

851
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,904
Trying to find ways to

852
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
Repackage the argument racism is great

853
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
It's good

854
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Let's not billets Nots

855
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,168
About that 21-gun salute

856
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,544
This is solely about the University of Virginia decided not to do a 21-gun salute at their veteran

857
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
Save that this

858
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,896
The reason was basically that it was disruptive to campus

859
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,992
And because there's a bunch of gun violence going on these days or maybe that's not necessary

860
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
I can hear argue

861
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,832
Events for people who love military tradition saying

862
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Salud is necessary

863
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,696
And I don't think I agree with them but I'm also not going to argue too much with it

864
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
But in this case

865
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,768
It feels really weird because

866
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,840
This was a University of Virginia ROTC event

867
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
So it's kind of their decision how to do things

868
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,704
Is there deciding not to do the salute

869
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Is Alex saying that

870
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
You should be able to

871
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Force them to do it

872
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
Like if this were the government or even the University

873
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
Telling them that they

874
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Can't do the salute

875
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,712
This argument might look a little different but that's not the case

876
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,528
Oh you're you're misunderstanding this is even worse than

877
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
Then you can imagine this is Android

878
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
The globalist

879
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
Have infiltrated the RO.

880
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
DC at the highest levels

881
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,512
Great all over the University of Virginia

882
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
Sure

883
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
Browse his position to make

884
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Any sense at all he would need to want

885
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,936
Insane level of control over the choices of other organization

886
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
He is not a part of

887
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
He sees this eel in the world that he proceeded

888
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
Someone not wanting to do a 21-gun salute and he decries it

889
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
The only point he could possibly be making his

890
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
I wish they wanted to do that

891
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,248
Salute there's nothing

892
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
To fight here

893
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,576
This is just trivial gun culture outrage

894
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
Which makes up another 30% of his coverage

895
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,720
Entire career

896
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
Generally speaking they do overlap

897
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Totally

898
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Totally

899
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
So Alex is still mad about Disney

900
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
He complains about them quite a bit

901
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,800
You don't show Lady and the Tramp you don't show Dumbo Dumbo has a loving mother

902
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
Not good ladies and gentlemen

903
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Stop

904
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,112
So again the warning on Dumbo was about there being a character named Jim Crow in it

905
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,464
Also in the movie Dumbo mothers and fathers don't create children

906
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
They're delivered by stork

907
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,840
So I'm not sure if Alex on steak this line of thought too far

908
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
Batman so

909
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,960
Counterpoint Alex

910
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
You know

911
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,312
You know the news is real bad whenever you're reduced to being

912
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,968
I guess let's b**** about Disney plus like an old man for 3 hours cuz

913
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
I can't deal with the fact that it's

914
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Very obvious my present

915
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
They committed a s*** ton of crime yeah

916
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
Everybody's Talkin

917
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
I got to I got to do something

918
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
I don't have the luxury of Fox News where I can put real-time refutation Liza in front of the

919
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Screen rather than

920
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Yeah

921
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
So Alex now

922
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
Gets off Intuit

923
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,056
A little bit of a second

924
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
Would be

925
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,176
Accurately described as transphobic

926
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
But also

927
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Is about

928
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Performers

929
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,064
So it's convoluted on some level

930
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
But it is just

931
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Outright

932
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Bigotry

933
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
And really really

934
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Gross

935
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
Say this first clip you talked about how

936
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,560
Trans movement

937
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
It's not about

938
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
People

939
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
It's not about

940
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Identity or anything like

941
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
What about

942
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,288
Is it somebody

943
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
It's about

944
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Truly

945
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
It's just about say so called trans movement isn't

946
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Bob Hope dressing up

947
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
Like a woman for Halloween

948
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
It's not even men that feel feminine

949
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,904
Okay want to be seen as women by their men

950
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
It is Satanism and vampirism

951
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,328
In total deception is it is what the movement is being pushed

952
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,776
And so a man six foot four man with vampire teeth on eating a baby is a woman the opposite

953
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
A woman giving birth loving a baby big nurturing

954
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,176
Demonstrate show

955
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
Simulating a terrific actor

956
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,296
Academy Award looks so satanic

957
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
When do Borat something on this

958
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
You call that a woman that's why number

959
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,536
And then you say that this vampire creature is an image of a mother

960
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
A raving lunatic

961
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
Scarier looking than It the clown

962
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,472
Still not named surrounding at the bar

963
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,288
Worshipping at like they're seeing some great goodness

964
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Because this is a real spirit

965
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,920
So I heard this in his like this isn't going to go well

966
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:27,040
This is this is I'm not a I'm not interested or very excited about the directions

967
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
He's going to take this

968
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
Just got done yelling about f****** Disney movies

969
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:38,304
So you riffs around a little bit here about how trans people are anti-human aliens

970
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,352
I didn't I thought we they were vampires

971
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,376
Well that's part of

972
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
AOC

973
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
Yoshi

974
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,776
Queen vampire occult show

975
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
Again

976
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Is that what they called in New York City

977
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,455
MC warships she put this big 6 ft 4 man

978
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,247
What are you doing

979
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,039
Party

980
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
More like some

981
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,159
Alien invading blood-drinking Martian

982
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Actually

983
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,839
Is destroyed ourselves humans were here. I don't have children

984
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:18,239
Human world

985
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,711
Mars Attacks how do they invade the Hollywood Squares

986
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
The big blonde hair

987
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Really

988
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,599
Are your friends

989
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
Whatever this is just anti-human

990
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,207
Woman to Woman

991
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
So when our two talking about that

992
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Person who is at

993
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Like a vampire

994
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
What have you few weeks back

995
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,775
He's really banking on his audience not realizing that a couple weeks back was f******

996
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Halloween

997
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Probably

998
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Halloween is actually evil

999
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
Anyway this is about a video that Alexandria ocasio-cortez put out where she met Sasha velour I noted drag

1000
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:11,743
According to their website bio page Sasha is gender-fluid and has no preferred pronoun in personal life

1001
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
But the drag Persona goes by femme

1002
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,167
Sasha was on drag race which AOC is a big fan of sushi was very excited to meet

1003
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
Performer from the show

1004
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,727
Is a big zero

1005
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,055
Alex ends up like the video of this

1006
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
He's just playing a 15-second

1007
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Video of a person

1008
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,687
Drag sitting on a bar in a Halloween costume

1009
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,247
It involves fake blood and a fake baby

1010
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,063
There's no context to it and honestly I'm ninety percent

1011
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Ensure that person

1012
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
Isn't even Sasha velour

1013
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:43,487
The person in that video is a big tattoo on their upper right arm and shoulder which Sasha does not have

1014
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,351
Alex just thinks they're the same person because they're both in Dragon appeared to be bald

1015
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
The person in that video.

1016
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
Actually have short hair but Sasha actually

1017
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
Shave their head in

1018
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
Order to honor their mother

1019
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Who died of cancer

1020
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,847
Also in the 2015 interview the person who

1021
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
Performed the Sasha velour was very clear that they're not tran

1022
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
So whatever Point hours

1023
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
Just trying to make you really just false

1024
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Flat

1025
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
But that doesn't change the reality that by his conflation of all these different gender expressions and identities boxing it all up

1026
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
Under The Heading of

1027
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,975
He's hoping to get people hurt

1028
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
Wasn't it some drag vampire

1029
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,631
That was Sasha velour show smoke and mirrors

1030
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
Also it wasn't a New York it was in Washington

1031
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,775
Nothing that I went to saying is based in reality but it doesn't

1032
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
Is it reality isn't the point

1033
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
Demonizing anyone who does

1034
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
I'm fitting to his rigid view of gender and sexuality is

1035
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
The point

1036
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
He wants to say that it was a New York

1037
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
Because that video of the

1038
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,575
The person on a bar is in New York

1039
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Conflating all of this

1040
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,927
Together in order to make it appear that they're the same person

1041
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,511
Even though later in the show he doesn't hate that he's not he doesn't know if they're the same

1042
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,327
He doesn't give a s***

1043
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
Smoking mirrors is A1 Queen show is Russia called

1044
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
It's a Theatre performer

1045
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,215
It's toward

1046
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
It's not like some kind of a basement

1047
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
Blood ritual like Alex is presenting

1048
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
Sirius respected well-reviewed show

1049
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
Has the backing

1050
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,967
Dan that's how she gets

1051
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,063
Do all of the the money to travel people pay Earth

1052
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
Not put too fine a point on this Alex is trying

1053
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
To get people killed

1054
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,559
The issue of trans and non-binary people particularly people of color being murdered is very serious

1055
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,375
Sushi right now to the point where the American Medical Association

1056
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
It's called violence again

1057
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Since the trans community and epidemic

1058
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
Is Alex Jones

1059
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,591
Cared at all about people he could express his discomfort with trans people in more responsible ways

1060
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
But he doesn't care

1061
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
He act like

1062
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,175
Grotesque

1063
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Act out about trans people wanting to

1064
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Eat your kids

1065
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Because he walks

1066
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,599
This sort of behavior doesn't lead tour people having a greater understanding

1067
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,231
Standing of each other it doesn't even lead to a place of like respectful disagreement live-and-let-live nothing like

1068
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
It's quite frankly incitement

1069
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
This is

1070
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,095
Did this doesn't

1071
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
You understand the point I'm trying to make

1072
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,703
Yeah I think the only path that this goes down is towards

1073
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Targeting

1074
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Abuse

1075
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
Harassment and potentially violent

1076
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
There's no

1077
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
There's no healthy outcome

1078
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
To the

1079
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Brewer

1080
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,735
They're probably satanic aliens bro I want your kids want to eat your blood

1081
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
This from a human

1082
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,623
No this is

1083
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,951
So many people are going to be viewed

1084
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,231
Not long

1085
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,767
I'm from now and RV right now

1086
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Review

1087
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
So many

1088
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
During the HIV

1089
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
How are you doing now just now

1090
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
A hole

1091
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
List of people

1092
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Just

1093
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Just basically saying

1094
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:42,431
I'm not trans so I don't really give a f*** yeah or even you could do an outright demonization or mocking them

1095
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
For Trans people get assaulted

1096
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,575
Umbrella this out to Altamonte

1097
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:53,439
Times throughout history people should have learned our lesson about what it looks like to be

1098
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
On the wrong side

1099
00:46:55,487 --> 00:47:00,095
Yeah right for your cultural issue

1100
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,679
With s*** that Nazi said 50 years ago I think you

1101
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
You should probably take a look at you

1102
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Yeah Oregon

1103
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
People

1104
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
So many

1105
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
What culturally moved

1106
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Many of these

1107
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
As long ago now.

1108
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,759
To be clear I don't I don't think

1109
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
You know

1110
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:25,695
You could easily call somebody transphobic or or whatever or bigoted you can

1111
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Alex is so far past

1112
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,791
Yeah it almost doesn't

1113
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
Even fit into the boxer

1114
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
So just

1115
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,423
Being pickle

1116
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
It's

1117
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,239
Where am I

1118
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Narratives

1119
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Call minutes certainly lines

1120
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
Itself to that even if that's not the prescription

1121
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
He's

1122
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:50,271
Suggested I don't know every single person is the devil

1123
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
That includes

1124
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Drag purple

1125
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,439
Apparently apparently that includes people who are just doing the show but I would say

1126
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
It's not

1127
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,487
Overtly

1128
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Or calling

1129
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
For extermination

1130
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
It's compatible

1131
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
Yeah that is a that is a

1132
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Fixing that I would make

1133
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
I think it's important

1134
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Consider things like that

1135
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
The ways in which the rhetoric you put out is

1136
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Compatible with

1137
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Something that you pretend

1138
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
You don't suppose

1139
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,151
Well it's hard to

1140
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
It's hard to die

1141
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Divest

1142
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,015
This particular calling some

1143
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
Something the devil with

1144
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,111
The other things that he's called the devil and the way that you're supposed

1145
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
To act toward those other

1146
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,999
You know so many other things get called the devil and it's

1147
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,071
Your job is God's servant to Destroyer

1148
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
You know if

1149
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
He just cuz he's not saying

1150
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,959
Destroy this time if you calling it

1151
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
The devil there's in there he's going

1152
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
He saying just Royce

1153
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,639
You know somebody has been very clear about the idea that you can't really coexist

1154
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,735
Raticate whatever the devil is

1155
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Seems like that's a logic

1156
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
If you do it then the devil will be doing so

1157
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
Something different you'll have to

1158
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
That and so on and so forth

1159
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Until

1160
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
So Alex descends

1161
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
Screaming rant

1162
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
About this Ranch

1163
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:11,679
So this is who we're supposed to worship a six-foot-four

1164
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:19,615
Open

1165
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
Call Steve

1166
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,479
Guys

1167
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:38,303
Prison photos

1168
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,655
Now I'm a woman

1169
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,943
Gimme your children right now

1170
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
I honestly don't know exactly what Alex

1171
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,671
Just talking about it through a lot of that

1172
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:09,791
If I had to guess there must be some YouTube video of someone wanting to be called ma'am and he's just losing his s*** about it

1173
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,583
I really don't know and I don't really care

1174
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,935
It's all good whatever it is. The same thing it's just more and deeper margin

1175
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Analyzation that he's pushing

1176
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
But here's the thing

1177
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,311
I don't know of any trans or nonbinary person who acts

1178
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,407
Screaming and ranting with insane and unhealthy levels of unchecked anger

1179
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
It doesn't ring true there but it really reminds me of Alex him

1180
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Where does

1181
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
That doesn't feel like a carrot

1182
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
That feels like Alec

1183
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
Alex is a person who rants like that's it

1184
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,999
Sincerely when he finds out about a gun control bill that died in

1185
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Committee 2 weeks

1186
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
Prior but he thinks it's still going to pass

1187
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:48,191
I went to the person who screams like this whenever he has to pretend like a white person didn't just commit a terrorist Act

1188
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,031
This rage that he's expressing is not true of some imagined

1189
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,335
Character who he wants basic polite

1190
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,383
Not extended to

1191
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,247
It's Alex's rage at the perceived crumbling of his straight white Christian male-dominated

1192
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Society

1193
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
That fuels

1194
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
Very real anger that he's

1195
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
He's manifesting

1196
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,975
I know I say this a lot but if you know Alex you have a responsibility to get here

1197
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,279
And probably get him into a

1198
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
Trans people are being killed at alarming rate

1199
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,191
And he's acting it weighs on are the perpetuate and escalate the mentality

1200
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,495
That make their being hurt far more likely

1201
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:28,127
If you think that he sincerely believes he's fine to do this because he thinks they're interdimensional demons

1202
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
That's all the oven

1203
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
Did you need to get him locked up on a 5150

1204
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
If you think he's just making it up

1205
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
And doesn't really believe this but still saying it on there

1206
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,903
Still evidence to get him locked up on a mental health hold

1207
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
Anyone who gave a f*** about Alex

1208
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
Could help him right now

1209
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
And get him to care that he desperately needs

1210
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
But I guess they'd rather wait until this whole thing reaches its

1211
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,375
Natural conclusion

1212
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Howard's

1213
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
The whole lot of you

1214
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
Anybody who can't help it isn't doing anything

1215
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Like just

1216
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Watching this play out

1217
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
Cowards

1218
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
So

1219
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,151
That's part of this is all particularly

1220
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Distasteful

1221
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Alex Goes To Break

1222
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
He comes back

1223
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Something

1224
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
John Cleese

1225
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
Something completely different okay

1226
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
Okay in a balance

1227
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
Let me get to it

1228
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
I have a message for

1229
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Contract

1230
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
Whistleblower

1231
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,167
Message to Joe Rogan

1232
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Talk shows in the world

1233
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,007
And it's this

1234
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
View art

1235
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Both of you

1236
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,455
I know can research the facts

1237
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
Or is this for yourself

1238
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
Alex

1239
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,367
Ongoing geoengineering programs

1240
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,903
Putting on this plan

1241
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
4 / 100

1242
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,095
A research institute the US Navy

1243
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Air Force

1244
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Weather

1245
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
Modification

1246
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
Programs using

1247
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
Alyssa Lies

1248
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
And other

1249
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Particular

1250
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Put out

1251
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Jet engines

1252
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
Using the jet engine to create the nuclei

1253
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
38

1254
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,391
Intensified ice crystallization the atmosphere

1255
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,279
10 years ago and talked about this then he hosted a program

1256
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
So what's going on here is that Alex

1257
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:31,775
Is deeply jealous of Rogan getting to interview Edward Snowden and also Alex really wants debate Joe into having him back on his

1258
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
Oh yeah that's the long and short of it

1259
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:38,687
Honestly normally I would just let this s*** slide and I'll get into it at all but after that out right

1260
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
Did Alex is coming with her earlier

1261
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
I feel like we need to cool down

1262
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
I think that would be nice

1263
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
So even though Alex only child

1264
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
Joe Rogan Edward Snowden

1265
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,183
I'm going to rise to the occasion

1266
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,999
And discuss why Alex is a f****** dumb dumb about chemtrail

1267
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
All right but I really want to wait

1268
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Wait until Ed Snowden

1269
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:00,447
It's on the line. You said on the Rogan show that you look for evidence

1270
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Aliens are chemtrails

1271
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:08,127
The files again

1272
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
He also said that if there is evidence of it

1273
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,223
He's not saying there isn't

1274
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
But if there is

1275
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
It's crazy

1276
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
CenterPoint

1277
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
With all the acts

1278
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
He says he had he couldn't

1279
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
Sunkist

1280
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
Stick to the actual claims in

1281
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,207
Specifics Alex uses

1282
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Over the course of

1283
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
Because I don't want to drift into some

1284
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
Some kind of absurd goose

1285
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,887
This is a topic that's so full of ridiculous stupid claim

1286
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,679
But Alex wants us to be serious

1287
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,959
So let's play it that way

1288
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,543
Oz first point that he brings up his about the 1960s

1289
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Stanford research

1290
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,639
This is a reference to an interview that he did back in

1291
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:45,247
In 2005 with a guy named Ben Livingston who he credits as the father of weather weapons

1292
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Okay

1293
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,623
Livingston is allegedly former Navy physicist who is involved in weaponizing weather in the

1294
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Bible A2000

1295
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
Ranor was working with a couple

1296
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
City called weather modification incorporate

1297
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
What is a real company

1298
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,863
But weirdly and apiece about their president which is

1299
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Discusses the company

1300
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
History and founding

1301
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,959
Livingston's name doesn't come up at all

1302
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
This company is in the business of clouds

1303
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
Which is a little different than count

1304
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,871
What they do is they fly planes into

1305
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
Clouds and release silver iodide

1306
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,711
Which is Mexico's weather molecules

1307
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
Come together and turn

1308
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Durant

1309
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,599
It's a technique that's been implemented to try and help drought-stricken region

1310
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,647
But it also doesn't really always work

1311
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,743
They can't make rain up here were moisture doesn't initially already

1312
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Exist

1313
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
Some experts

1314
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,631
The pointed out the cloud seeding only really works when there would have been rain anyway

1315
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:39,263
It's pretty unclear the extent to which cloud seeding does help but it's way more clear that it doesn't really have

1316
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,311
Any damaging environmental or health

1317
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Too Human Side Effects

1318
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,663
There's literally no evidence of this technique

1319
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Create

1320
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,039
Get rid of hurricanes or steer them to attack someplace like Alex wants you to believe

1321
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,111
There was a project carried out by the government starting in 19

1322
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,159
T2 called project stormfury

1323
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
Which hypothesized they could use cloud seeding

1324
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,767
Need to decrease the destructive power of hurricane

1325
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,071
By seeding clouds around the hurricane

1326
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
It disrupts the inner structure of the storm

1327
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
They changed the name from

1328
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Plan

1329
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
What about supervillain

1330
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
There was another name

1331
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:16,639
M48 initially the goza precursor program to this but it's all tomato

1332
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,223
Jesus Christ guy they found that this definitely did not

1333
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
Well it seemed like it was a possible approach the

1334
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
The science behind the high pop

1335
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,599
This is about to be flawed

1336
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
And the program was disc

1337
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Continue

1338
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,439
Innocence of controlling hurricanes

1339
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,487
Stormfury was a complete failure

1340
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
What scientist actually learned a lot about weather patterns of the process

1341
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,119
So we can kind of call it a win on some levels and

1342
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
It's not a huge embarrassing

1343
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,191
Surefire sight

1344
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
Naming it

1345
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
Stormfury might be a little bit

1346
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
I don't like it

1347
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
All this stuff is just faint

1348
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,479
The rest of it delivered by Ben Livingston in an interview with Alex Jones a2005

1349
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,039
I watched a bit of the interview and honestly

1350
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,575
It kind of feels like Project Camelot

1351
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Hot stuff

1352
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,671
Well there's a kernel of Truth in there do you know the cloud seeding does

1353
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
Existing private company

1354
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
Please do it I'll just take it

1355
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,791
The extensions of it a bit too

1356
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
Too far

1357
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Quite frankly

1358
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
I have no idea you been living

1359
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,727
Yeah the only trace of him anywhere that's life doesn't appearance on Infowars

1360
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:20,383
There's no academic papers he's written there's no references left in the Congressional Record or anything like that it's all just stuff that he

1361
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175
He said and Alex's taken as gospel

1362
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,271
It's impossible to know if Ben Livingston is a credible Source on anything

1363
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:29,343
Unless Alex Cooper vide another source on this

1364
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
These are claims that I can allowed to stand

1365
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:37,791
So far all that Alex is bringing to the table here is a fourteen-year-old interview he did with some guy

1366
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
I need better

1367
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,863
Well I mean Ben Livingston did

1368
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Name later on

1369
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,423
Does that

1370
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,983
I presume

1371
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,079
I'm pretty old in 2005 I don't know if you still with us

1372
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,359
I don't know I don't know

1373
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
Can't find anything else about him except for an Infowars

1374
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,967
Suggest obviously that

1375
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
He is 104

1376
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,807
Correct they are scrubbing every bit of the record

1377
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,367
Just like they did to keep it away from Ed Snowden

1378
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,671
They've gotten rid of the files damn they're not

1379
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,767
Well I would believe that it's possible although I don't know this

1380
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,607
Could have been a pilot who was involved

1381
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,631
Live with storm

1382
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
I think that is

1383
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,751
Not outside the realm of a possibility

1384
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
But the

1385
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
Conclusions that he brings

1386
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,663
To the table and things he talks about are not supported by any available in

1387
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
And I need that other backing

1388
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
To the claims that he's making

1389
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Or else

1390
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,319
I just think well this is a guy

1391
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,623
Who may or may not have been

1392
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
A pilot

1393
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
Who now is crazy

1394
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,511
Well I mean I think the I think

1395
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
You fart

1396
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
The people who came up with

1397
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
What if we could weaponize hurricane

1398
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
And we're a little bit out there as well but so I think he could

1399
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,311
Very well be

1400
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,895
Accepted by that group

1401
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,687
Do they like if you are

1402
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
People who have

1403
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Know what it's possible that we could create cloud

1404
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,599
Hurricanes are problem they're very destructive

1405
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
If there was a way we could use the

1406
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
This technology with

1407
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Cloud seeding

1408
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,487
Disrupt the hurricane

1409
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
Blessing it's damaging effects

1410
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
Why wouldn't you try it

1411
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
Like why wouldn't you researched

1412
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
Well I mean Government research is all sorts of

1413
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
Yeah

1414
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
Yeah I mean I would assume that

1415
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,615
Much like the the how to know when you're on the right side of History the

1416
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Should we have

1417
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:31,455
Control over the weather I bet it's probably never going to

1418
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
But used in a evil horrible way in hurricane

1419
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,343
Control plan is probably

1420
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
On the like

1421
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
Maybe we should leave that one alone you got a whole situation call it super villainous or you could call it just the inevitable can

1422
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Inclusion where human curiosity

1423
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
If you could say that about the internet

1424
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,935
Right

1425
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,959
That's also a bummer

1426
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
Straight to Grey Goo

1427
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,823
Syrian you're like well I guess we're f*****

1428
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
It's not so much that we're f*****

1429
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,663
It's that the constant

1430
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,735
Path of human evolution

1431
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,783
Does involve a certain amount of risk

1432
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,111
With the things that our curiosity will inevitably bring us

1433
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,159
So the path

1434
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
The challenge

1435
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:16,255
Is figuring out a way that we can incorporate those

1436
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
Really dangerous things

1437
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Into

1438
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Sustainable world

1439
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,143
So I don't see any of that is being

1440
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,935
Supervillain is or even

1441
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
Doom

1442
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:30,079
Yes you might look at it like we're inevitably trending towards Graco

1443
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
It's

1444
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
It certainly is like well that's something we should keep in mind

1445
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
That is a

1446
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
Gabriel - how come

1447
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,783
What does it mean if that's the inevitable out

1448
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,087
There's a way you can have

1449
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,927
Inability to control hurricane

1450
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Which again

1451
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
We do not

1452
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
There is a way that

1453
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
You can have that

1454
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Edit not be

1455
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Okay

1456
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
Probably

1457
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,727
I don't know why we've only talked to Nuke so I think we're good we're doing alright

1458
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
You know with infinite

1459
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:03,615
World ending power we have only dropped two

1460
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
Set alarm

1461
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Destroy the world.

1462
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
We have yet to do so

1463
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,951
Yes you could look at it as Bleak but it also at there's a

1464
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,231
Silver lining

1465
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,607
So Alex brings back to the table and that's not a good starting point

1466
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,911
All that stuff is just stuff that been living

1467
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Vincent told him

1468
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
Until I got to throw that out a tiny bit cuz it's not really

1469
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,823
I thought like maybe that was it

1470
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
But he has more

1471
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,431
Can I get it he has staked his reputation that you do

1472
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,991
Going on the quote using the LIE term

1473
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,063
Chemtrails don't exist

1474
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Haha

1475
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
Altitude Araceli

1476
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
Geoengineering

1477
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Programs

1478
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:53,023
Show you

1479
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
Smithsonian

1480
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,191
Cfrb the CIA director admitting it

1481
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
This is where I get

1482
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
Tumescent

1483
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
Jordan cuz you got something

1484
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
Really sticky

1485
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,383
Yeah this is where I'm like crime on this

1486
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Well whatever Alex

1487
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
Really is like I'm going to

1488
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,503
To prove something that's what I like

1489
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:19,903
Time to go to work until like 3 or 4 in the morning last night

1490
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,695
Knuckle

1491
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
Okay

1492
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
I don't think Alex is trying most

1493
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,119
He's pretending he's trying

1494
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
Right at least

1495
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
This is

1496
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
A time when am I okay

1497
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,055
I have a worthy opponent

1498
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Give me very excited

1499
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,871
So anyway here's worries.

1500
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
And I want to be clear

1501
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,711
I've not cut out stuff where you give good eggs

1502
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,063
All of this is going to be terrible everybody didn't

1503
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Need that

1504
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,951
I just wanted to be clear that's not like there's a Smoking Gun in here and I was like Let's ignore that

1505
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,047
There are a lot of governments involved now at the secret treaty level

1506
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,679
Fuel project

1507
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,007
Two scientists won the Nobel Prize in 1992

1508
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
Coming up with this plan

1509
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,103
So right off the bat I can't do s*** with secret treaties

1510
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:17,503
That's an unacceptable thing to bring into the conversation so I'm going to ignore it unless Alex can produce those trees

1511
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:20,575
Level of secret treaties and neither is out as I get up

1512
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,903
So you can easily look up Nobel Prize winners and Alex's lying

1513
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,303
What is write-up

1514
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,679
Forget about Nobel Prize winner so we can ignore the fields of literature peace and economics

1515
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,215
Those aren't related here at all

1516
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495
And I looked at them for 19

1517
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,263
And I do have another

1518
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,311
That leaves medicine

1519
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Chemistry and physics

1520
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,895
Is the fields of Nobel

1521
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Awards

1522
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
That could

1523
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Bee-related

1524
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,599
Who won the physics award that year for his invention of a particle that

1525
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:54,879
That's not related

1526
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
Randolph Marcus 14

1527
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,207
For chemistry for his work in the

1528
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,255
Is related to the theory of electron

1529
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
Transfer react

1530
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Chemical systems

1531
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Not related

1532
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,655
Two guys Edmund Fisher and Edwin cribs

1533
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,495
Amino acid related research

1534
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
That was two scientists

1535
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
But it was

1536
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:19,455
None of this has anything to do with secret plans to dim the world through geoengineering where the f*** is talking about

1537
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,807
Didn't the Nobel Prize in literature go to a guy who wrote

1538
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,647
Hey how about we build some other weapons or what now come on now hey

1539
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:31,743
Long titles of 1990

1540
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:37,631
G513 scientist won the Nobel Prize for their work understanding the chemistry involved in the formation and

1541
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
Destruction of ozone

1542
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,775
I assume that's what he's talking about because it involves the sky but also has nothing to do with Kevin

1543
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,823
Entrails to make the Earth Denver to fight global warming

1544
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
Later in life one of those three science

1545
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
Who did get the Nobel Prize in 90

1546
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
95

1547
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,039
Did come out publicly in favor of exploring engineering

1548
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,319
Solutions to climate change

1549
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
Problems

1550
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,671
But that's not what he got the Nobel Prize for Alex if he's talking about them

1551
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Eve conflating things

1552
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,743
And he got the year wrong

1553
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
Yes is making

1554
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
Shut up please just talking

1555
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,839
So none of the Nobel Prize winners

1556
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,375
The Chemtrails are

1557
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,191
Not in the way that Alex's

1558
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,543
Joey gets on to his next piece of evidence he said that he's going to bring up

1559
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
The CFR the dod all of it

1560
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Bring something.

1561
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,199
Okay let's get into it right now

1562
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Overhead shot

1563
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,575
US Department of Defense

1564
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
28

1565
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
1997

1566
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975
Secretary defense Williams

1567
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,935
Others are working on weather control

1568
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
Control

1569
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,287
Define 3rd is on

1570
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,591
Right off the bat this can be ignored

1571
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,663
His proof is at this guy in the DoD said that people are working

1572
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
Weather weapons

1573
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,015
That doesn't mean that anyone has ever successfully made one or that any of this is

1574
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Real

1575
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,111
The statement that people walk whether weapons he's totally logic

1576
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Inconsistent

1577
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
With the statement no one has ever made weather wise

1578
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,231
Wanting something and work

1579
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
Working on something is not the same as that thing

1580
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
Being real

1581
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:15,679
So we talked about this a little bit in the past but because Alex is doing a large breakdown and going to

1582
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
Cover something we've already talked about

1583
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,055
This was a news story about a speech that William Cohen gave it

1584
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
The University of Georgia

1585
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,407
On terrorism weapons of mass destruction in US strategy

1586
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,687
Is entirely about

1587
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Connery in The Avengers

1588
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
Baby might have been

1589
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,319
If you read the quote in context you learn that

1590
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,367
Bitcoin is talking about fake reports

1591
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,159
And how they can really f****** at the park

1592
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,487
He was asked a question about a false alarm about an anthrax

1593
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,559
Scared that it happened at b'nai brith the previous week

1594
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:46,911
Which going relates that sort of false alarm to the sort of scares

1595
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,447
Can happen when there's a belief

1596
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,031
There's a mole within a particular law enforcement or government agent

1597
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Quote

1598
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,615
The mere fear that there's a mole within an agency

1599
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Can set off a chain reaction

1600
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,223
Hot for that particular Bowl we could paralyze the agents

1601
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
54 weeks in months

1602
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Here's even

1603
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
In a search

1604
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
The same thing is true about just

1605
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,623
The false care of a threat

1606
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,695
If using some kind of a chemical weapon or biological one

1607
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Their reports

1608
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,023
Example that some countries have been trying to

1609
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,887
Construct something like an ebola virus that would be very dangerous a phenomenon to say the least

1610
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,703
Alvin Toffler is written about this in terms of

1611
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,775
Some scientist and their Laboratories trying to divide certain types of

1612
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Pathogens that would be

1613
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,359
Specific so they could just eliminate us

1614
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
Ethnic group

1615
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
Open race

1616
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
And others are designing so

1617
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,199
Some sort of engineering

1618
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
Some sort of insects

1619
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,503
Destroy specific crop

1620
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
Others are engaging even in

1621
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,831
Eco type of terrorism

1622
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:42,463
Whereby they can alter the climate set off earthquakes volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves

1623
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
This list

1624
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:48,351
Specific weapons like weaponized Ebola and the weather weapon

1625
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,911
Examples of possibly fake reports

1626
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Can come up

1627
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
The Cripple of depart

1628
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,775
Mad because I have to respond to the report is if they're real

1629
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,359
This is not evidence of William Cohen saying that there are weather weather

1630
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,199
He's not even saying that anyone has one he's not even saying that I wasn't working

1631
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,783
You think there might be false reports of these sorts of things

1632
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
So far Alex

1633
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Has provided

1634
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
Evidence of

1635
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
Nothing

1636
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
So

1637
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
So if I understand correctly his evidence

1638
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
Is William Cohen

1639
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Sad that people

1640
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Could be lying

1641
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
Yes

1642
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:28,031
Be very the very nature of this possible lie being reported

1643
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,567
Can be devastating

1644
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
And the money suck

1645
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
Time-suck

1646
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Ford

1647
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,431
Guys like that Twilight Zone

1648
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
Write the context of this makes it clear that he's

1649
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Not saying

1650
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,527
Anything

1651
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,599
Concrete and the way that Alex want you to

1652
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,159
So Alex gets to his next piece of evidence

1653
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,207
Let's move on to the next thing

1654
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,839
Other weapons of existed over 15 years testified US Secretary of Defense

1655
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,191
This is an article published on natural news

1656
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
So already not great

1657
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
Burn It Down

1658
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:04,127
Vertical ground so it just to be even you could just this message page.

1659
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,711
The Secretary of Defense in question there

1660
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,759
Is William Cohen of course

1661
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,439
Exact same story as the fact that cannot be okay story

1662
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,255
Publisher the b******* had to hang up Mike Adams website

1663
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
Unacceptable

1664
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,839
Alex's literally proved nothing

1665
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
So anyway here's a bunch of it

1666
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
In this folder IFC fr

1667
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,919
10 running quasi secret program

1668
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
Dockside

1669
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
Corporate level

1670
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,367
Eliza's it into

1671
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
Nuclei

1672
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,071
Artificial clouds I don't give a f*** about that folder unless you decide exactly what's

1673
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,119
Alex can talk about Bill Gates

1674
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,167
See how far until he passes out from exhaustion

1675
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,727
Can I still won't give a s*** unless he gives me some specifics

1676
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,079
At best as I could tell right now all of this is just a talking about cloud seeding

1677
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,895
Exaggerating it way far past the reality

1678
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,479
Yeah I think that's all he's doing is bringing up hats

1679
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:18,879
But you can't trust that like crazy impossible possible

1680
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,183
Trolls whodas it on thing there

1681
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:27,583
Cooper little man maybe later on something will be related to Kanye

1682
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
Time machines yeah yeah

1683
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Yeah

1684
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,191
Any of them good though baby

1685
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:37,055
Comes up right after this and made me worried that was

1686
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,407
Get to these clips let's play Joe Rogan

1687
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,455
Whatever Snowden

1688
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
A few weeks ago

1689
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:50,367
Is everything in the world

1690
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,415
So like you jumping now

1691
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,743
Clips of Snowden as if he's proved his case

1692
01:10:55,999 --> 01:11:02,143
All he's done is talk about Williams make a reference to a 14

1693
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,959
Underworld interview

1694
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,799
That's it

1695
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Cuz he is done

1696
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
381

1697
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
0 he went

1698
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:18,271
Also literally his entire career is based on him being a guy who has secret government

1699
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,343
He can't be that judge Aguirre

1700
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,135
All you got RC

1701
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,159
Secret government

1702
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:27,487
That is a problem

1703
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
But the reality of this is as we

1704
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
It's very

1705
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
He's just mad at Joe

1706
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,143
Joe Rogan tells us it doesn't

1707
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,679
Installed

1708
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Metronews

1709
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
So

1710
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,895
Everything we told you 20 years ago turned out to be dead on exactly right

1711
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,247
We're more discredited

1712
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
More discredited

1713
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:57,695
So the mainstream news article headlined that I would slashes up there is about Bill Gates supporting a group that's coming up with solutions to climb

1714
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:03,327
A change using solar Engineering Management governance

1715
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
Initiative or cloudy

1716
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,447
Give me Frank their plan does sound

1717
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
Sound a lot like

1718
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
Like what Alex has been talking about

1719
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
About what was the release

1720
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,847
Tons of particles at a high-altitude to block a reduce the

1721
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
The impact of

1722
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,711
That's all good and well but that's not a thing that people are doing

1723
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:26,111
It's technically possible in their plans at this point in the unit at work there's a very good reason that no one would ever let

1724
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,927
Let them do this unless there was literally no other option

1725
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,255
That's because the consequences of doing something like this would be

1726
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Insane

1727
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,327
Including but not limited to making

1728
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,119
Biscotti no longer blue

1729
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
I mean

1730
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:44,287
You know I'm pretty sure that there's never been any movies made in the past about what would happen

1731
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
You know Messi

1732
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,431
They've done some modelling of the idea and found that it would be cheap

1733
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,247
It'll probably be effective in reducing heat coming in

1734
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:58,623
No way of knowing what other sorts of disruptions to natural processes the plan might have

1735
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,183
And that's why this requires more research

1736
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:05,791
Bill Gates has been on the table for a long time and we've talked about it before

1737
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,119
He's not advocating that we do this but he's funding Research into

1738
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:14,239
The things that we can do if we end up in a real serious crisis and the world is becoming uninhabitable

1739
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,055
It's very possible that there could come a day

1740
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Where the ecosystem is so distraught

1741
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Goodbye something like climate change

1742
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:24,223
That we would be absolutely thrilled to risk the Blue Sky in order to survive

1743
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
And by that point

1744
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
It's way too late

1745
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
To research any of this stuff

1746
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,159
By putting money into it now we do few Manatee options later

1747
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
Which are super important

1748
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,487
They would be helpful yes

1749
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
Pick up everywhere

1750
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Likely to be

1751
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,655
So that's the headline Alex flashes up on screen

1752
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:48,799
So to reiterate so far Alex has done nothing to convince me the Chemtrails or secret geoengineering program is

1753
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
All this evidence amounts to nothing

1754
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
And I didn't cut things out worry drop bombshells

1755
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,503
This seems to be all he's got other than whatever is in that super cool folder of is

1756
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,111
This is the look like part of the episode where I could descend into a protected list of all the time

1757
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
Suppose chemtrail science

1758
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Is the weather shift

1759
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,951
Debunked every embarrassing

1760
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Attempt to prove this s***

1761
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
But I'm not here to prove a negative

1762
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,375
How to draw Bowser show that Joe Rogan and Edward Snowden were liars and wrong to say that

1763
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,655
Chemtrails aren't real

1764
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
You spelled in his task

1765
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,727
Worse than project storm Fury

1766
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
To be clear

1767
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,311
I recognized that I was just do this whole cycle

1768
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,847
To try and bake Joe at the heaven

1769
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Get back on his podcast

1770
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
I really just wanted to read

1771
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,967
For this episode so so here we are

1772
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,247
I know you I know.

1773
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
I know feels go

1774
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,367
Alex is mad about Joe Rogan

1775
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
Start screaming

1776
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
Grapes

1777
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Podcast

1778
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,279
Earlier this year

1779
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,263
Professor

1780
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,543
They just announced

1781
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,871
But they're doing

1782
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,991
Other dimensions

1783
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,319
Sure

1784
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,647
When I was 8 years old around dinner table

1785
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,719
With people involved in the project

1786
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Okay

1787
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:18,143
So I think I was talking about Rick Strassman who's the guy who wrote The Spirit Molecule and he's been this dude Strassman

1788
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,679
For a long time

1789
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,471
To prolong the DMT trip

1790
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,007
Through like an IV drip

1791
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,799
It's at least back to 26

1792
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
Like there was an article in Vice

1793
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:32,479
I'm not sure if that dude ever been on Rogan show by Betty what has how many would-be

1794
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:36,831
The guy about beat DMT

1795
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,951
I didn't look through all of Rogan's episodes but I was scrolling through them and

1796
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
His name didn't come up

1797
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,023
At least in the time frame that Alex's tacos

1798
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
But I would bet

1799
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
Anything that I own that whoever was

1800
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
The cast was talking about Strasburg

1801
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,495
This has nothing to do with the government thinking the people are talking

1802
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
Aliens and getting their commands

1803
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
The higher-ups in the Demon World

1804
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,407
Honestly if the government were researching

1805
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,199
Like why wouldn't they

1806
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,783
Government grants are behind all sorts of scientific research

1807
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,575
I have some people who take DMT

1808
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
He think that they're talking to alien

1809
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Why the hell wouldn't that be an area worth it

1810
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Exploring

1811
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,463
If you research that

1812
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,535
It doesn't mean you actually believe the people are talking to alien

1813
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,071
You could very well be in

1814
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,143
Student learning more about the parts of the brain that are involved in hallucinate

1815
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,471
They're plenty of research here that are agnostic

1816
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,495
Towards the exist

1817
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Supremes.

1818
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Dimensional demon

1819
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
Put simply Alex's f******

1820
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Stupid

1821
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
I'm starting LSD

1822
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,527
MDMA in the like it for

1823
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,319
Possible treatments for p

1824
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
PTSD

1825
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,367
And all of those things

1826
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
Why not

1827
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,159
Add DMT

1828
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,695
Let's figure some

1829
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Come sit out

1830
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,511
Yep prohibition doesn't work

1831
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
There are there are a

1832
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
Great deal of applications

1833
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,119
For research

1834
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
And uses

1835
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
Spray this other than map

1836
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
Sing out a spirit world to talk to

1837
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Right right right

1838
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,311
I remember her so I wouldn't take that off

1839
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,383
People who were studying like loose

1840
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
To Dreaming my God

1841
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
There's some

1842
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,831
Researchers were doing that that's the terms in which they were talking about that to like mapping out these

1843
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
Subconscious world

1844
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:16,159
It's sort of a way of

1845
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:20,511
Contextualizing it in your mind when it's not like you're actually going in and maybe

1846
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Like doing cartago

1847
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Or something

1848
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
If you if you have a scientist

1849
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,143
Give you an exact

1850
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
Chemical definition

1851
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,191
Mission of what it is they're doing

1852
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,239
Your eyes glaze over and you're not

1853
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,823
If you have them give you a metaphor that allows you to

1854
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
Expensive weather

1855
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
Helps

1856
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,919
Alex Jones will take it out of context

1857
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,199
Destroy the world

1858
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
You know

1859
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,063
Right right

1860
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,367
Alex is the crazy one that's

1861
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:49,695
Oh that's kooky cookie talk to aliens

1862
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,839
Globalist project

1863
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
Even though it's all true

1864
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,455
Welcome back on the play the eclipse but the Blood start getting to Snowden

1865
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:19,135
So now apparently the entire chemtrail thing is about

1866
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:23,743
People taking DMT talking to demon aliens who are telling them to

1867
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,607
Go form the planet in order to make it hospitable for them to come because

1868
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,935
I guess they can't breathe oxygen or this is

1869
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,775
Yeah it is it that if you do not agree with that that sounds great

1870
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:41,151
Motor standard business where it's gone

1871
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,551
Call out Joe Rogan Edward Snowden because he has all the proof about chemtrails

1872
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:52,415
DMT aliens are telling the government to go farm the planet

1873
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,439
Okay

1874
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,511
We are off the f****** rails

1875
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,815
This is where I'm like alright

1876
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:05,727
I looked weird and straight up to your specific

1877
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,519
Fireplace your b*******

1878
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,335
So anyway

1879
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Alex is mad

1880
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
It snowed in

1881
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,967
And I find something he says in this next clip variant

1882
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
I'm refreshed

1883
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:23,647
Should have somebody be mad at Snowden about a new reason for a new reason this is nice it's interesting

1884
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
Mad at Snowden about DMT before

1885
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,463
Well

1886
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,743
That's part of the reason

1887
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
But I

1888
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
Alex says something revealing

1889
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,351
But the main thing is

1890
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:36,191
Conspiracy theories right everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories book

1891
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,495
It helps life makes sense

1892
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
Just believe

1893
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
Somebody's control

1894
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:47,455
In control somebody's calling the shots these things happen for a reason

1895
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,087
John Wayne when he first came out he lives for us

1896
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,887
Okay Alex has been pretty consistent in his support of Edward Snowden because he revealed information that tended to help out

1897
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
Let's create conspiracy theory

1898
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:10,751
The stuff Snowden released generally speaking was well in line with

1899
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:15,104
With the view of the US government was evil which job did real well with Alex's anti-government

1900
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:18,432
But now he said that there's no evidence of chemtrail

1901
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
And Alex has decided

1902
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,784
He was right all along and that Snowden was controlled opposition

1903
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,600
Man it's a bad day now what I find most in

1904
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
Interesting about that is that

1905
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
Steve has been auntie Snowden from

1906
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
The job but

1907
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
That actually works

1908
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,304
Pretty well for my theory that Steve gets all of his information

1909
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
From Stratford

1910
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,352
The intelligence

1911
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,680
Yeah yeah they would also be pretty heavily against

1912
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,800
If you recall in our episode that were recovered Stephen Depp

1913
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,360
We discussed her Wikileaks stratfor email.

1914
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,920
Included a bunch of customer service emails from

1915
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,968
Pieczenik where we learned that sense

1916
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,784
At least do mid early-to-mid 2000

1917
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:59,904
Steve has been a lifetime member of their privately produced intelligent product and their publication

1918
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,976
A 2016 article put out by Stratford

1919
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
Includes are discussing Snowden as an

1920
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
Example of a quote

1921
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,584
Internal threat

1922
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,912
In 2013 Stratford founder George freed

1923
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,216
Wrote an op-ed in Forbes titled quote

1924
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Keeping the

1925
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
NSA in

1926
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Perspective

1927
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,592
Where he argues that the spying programs revealed by Snowden

1928
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
Nabil

1929
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,480
Quote the revelations about prism are far from New or interesting in themselves

1930
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,552
Beyonce was created with a charter to do these things

1931
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,880
And given the state of Technology was inevitable that the NSA would

1932
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,160
Recapturing communication

1933
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Around the world

1934
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Many weeks prior to Snowden

1935
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,256
Show that the NSA was doing

1936
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,864
It would have been more newsworthy if the leak revealed that the NSA had not been

1937
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
Capturing all the communique

1938
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,240
It seems like Stratford has a bit of a not super into Snowden

1939
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,544
That would make sense

1940
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
I think they

1941
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Just put

1942
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,920
Together that I think the best argument for

1943
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,272
Dissolving the NSA entirely right literally what he just said was

1944
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,088
Well of course they were going to break the Constitution

1945
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Duh

1946
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,672
They're essentially a private version of anak

1947
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:10,304
They share common cause with something like the NSA so they would likely see Snowden

1948
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,096
Similarly to how the NSA would

1949
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,376
As an internal

1950
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,704
It's possible this doesn't mean anything but this is

1951
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
Definitely a position you'd expect to see from

1952
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
I'm someone who is just regurgitating private

1953
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,568
Intelligence company Prada

1954
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,104
So

1955
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,896
You know that's a little bit of a car

1956
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
I did it fits in line

1957
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,808
So now that Alex has dropped off into talkin about how the Chemtrails are really just part of it

1958
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
Grands

1959
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
DMT alien

1960
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,392
Conspiracy

1961
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,928
I'm still struggling to

1962
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:40,512
Wrap my head around that one but we can move on I thought that he was done

1963
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,072
Wright returns

1964
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,144
They're simply aliens involved unless

1965
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,912
Brennan

1966
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:54,848
Right as he plays a clip of him here and this is a little bit of a longer Cliff but I think

1967
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
If it merits

1968
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,688
So let's play the

1969
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,504
Of the CIA

1970
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,344
Specifically repeating what we said they were doing 20 years ago

1971
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,440
Another example is the array of Technologies

1972
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,256
Poppin referred to collectively as geoengineering

1973
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,096
Potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change

1974
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,912
One that has gained my personal attention

1975
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
Stratospheric

1976
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
Aerosol injection

1977
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,752
Or Sai

1978
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,616
A method of treating the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's Heat

1979
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,688
How much the same way that volcanic eruptions do

1980
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,528
An essay I program could limit Global temperature increase

1981
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,856
Reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures

1982
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,440
Provided the world economy additional time to transition for

1983
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,464
From fossil fuels

1984
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,280
This process is also relatively inexpensive

1985
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,816
The national resource

1986
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,912
Research Council estimates that I fully deployed sa-i program would cost about

1987
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,936
10 billion dollars

1988
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Yearly

1989
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:58,848
As promising as it may be moving forward an essay I would also raised a number of challenges for a government

1990
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
Answer the internet

1991
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
Community

1992
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,968
On the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions

1993
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
We still have to

1994
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,064
Company Sai to address other climate change affects

1995
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,624
Such as ocean acidification

1996
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:14,464
Because saii alone would not be moved greenhouse gases from the atmos

1997
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
On the geopolitical side

1998
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,608
The Technology's potential to alter weather patterns

1999
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:25,216
And benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions

2000
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:28,032
Could trigger sharp opposition by Sundays

2001
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,360
Others might seize on essay eyes benefits

2002
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,432
I'm back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide

2003
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,760
And as with other breakthrough Technologies

2004
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
Global norms and standards are lacking

2005
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
The guide to deployment

2006
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,856
Implantation

2007
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,880
SAR

2008
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,184
Other geoengineering initiatives

2009
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:50,304
But Edward Snowden said it didn't exist on the cool pretty show

2010
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,144
You got him Alex

2011
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
See how that works

2012
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
Nothing to Brandon side In that clip can be taken really to mean that there is a program there is a potential thing that had

2013
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
Been research

2014
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,712
He's talking about this in the terms of this wood or

2015
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,784
Implementing this would create a number of

2016
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,576
Issues that would need to be resolved

2017
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,624
He's talking about there's in a hypothetical

2018
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,440
You can't introduce this as evidence that something does a

2019
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,792
And you like no one no one can deny that research

2020
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,840
Wright has been done on similar topic

2021
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,144
It's right no one can deny that cloud seeding

2022
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,168
Isn't something

2023
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,448
That has been done

2024
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,752
But to extrapolate it into the

2025
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
A conspiracy that

2026
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,288
He's pushing

2027
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
Is completely absurd

2028
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
I saw somebody with the

2029
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
Slingshot so that me

2030
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,688
Who's that

2031
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Control the weather

2032
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,016
Sure

2033
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,040
That's pretty soon

2034
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,600
That's how it works here is the last

2035
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,416
Clip-in are segments that I'm going

2036
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
Call Alex Azar

2037
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,464
Conspiracy dumped

2038
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,280
I can show you the Smithsonian articles

2039
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,816
Department of the articles

2040
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
Program

2041
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,872
Roll your sleeves up

2042
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,640
You smug

2043
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:15,040
A****** while I got all these things I could show you but I've already proved my case

2044
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
Proof

2045
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,024
So anyway that's kind of this segment

2046
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,584
Doodle Alex has

2047
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Too much of it

2048
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,912
Mid-segment

2049
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
Yeah

2050
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,008
So now we get to the the real enemies

2051
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:39,360
Steve is back up boy

2052
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Man

2053
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
So great

2054
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
So great

2055
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,968
On so many levels

2056
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
I could listen

2057
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,040
Steve y'all italics

2058
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,880
If you really rude to him the whole time

2059
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,440
Dynamic and that is what I was really really liked him

2060
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,744
Talk because I think that Alex has been humble

2061
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,792
Bye-bye Steve

2062
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Inside of a galaxy

2063
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,888
I don't know what the actual Dynamic behind

2064
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,424
Machines is or how it's

2065
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
Changed over the

2066
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,240
The year plus that he hasn't been on

2067
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,032
Yeah but Alex does seem

2068
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,080
Far less willing to fight with

2069
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,872
And

2070
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
Steve is up to his old tricks

2071
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,248
You know how whenever in the past Alex would introduce him he would

2072
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,040
Flatter Alex with Akio the best

2073
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,088
Yeah he's upped his game

2074
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,624
A little bit

2075
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,024
Going to get a real brown nose on this one no no no it takes a completely different form okay scism

2076
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
Weather

2077
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,168
Thank you for getting me back on the show

2078
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,240
But you are an interesting times live

2079
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,800
Summarizing 33-seat Jefferson

2080
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,384
Call Jack.

2081
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
In Liberty we will have

2082
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
Have to sacrifice the blood

2083
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
Patriots and Tyra

2084
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,296
And that's exactly what

2085
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:58,976
Steve immediately quotes Jefferson he is the best

2086
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,792
No he's so good at all quotes

2087
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:06,144
He's so good at manipulating Alex we've got a complete moratorium on

2088
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,240
But that one is actually using it as close to accurately as any

2089
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:13,824
That's fine but I'm still calling a moratorium on Jeffrey

2090
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,432
But it's so fascinating that that's exactly what you do at Alex

2091
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,736
Galaxy quote Jefferson all the goddamn time

2092
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:24,832
Heart explodes with patriotism and he's like whatever you have to say next

2093
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
F****** saluting Steve

2094
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
Right now

2095
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,232
So you know they start talking about the MP

2096
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,536
My little bit the impeachment inquiry

2097
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,096
And Steve naturally

2098
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:43,776
Is millions and millions of dollars wasted on a

2099
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,336
Access that will guarantee

2100
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,176
Where Trump will be reelected in 2020

2101
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:54,272
There's no question of it this is the demise of the Democratic Party

2102
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,416
They are in a spiral of self-destruction

2103
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,232
So why aren't you for it then

2104
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
Why shouldn't you be so

2105
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,328
Real Trump is getting impeached

2106
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:13,728
Because it's the demise of the Democratic Party

2107
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
Trump's going to get reelected

2108
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,360
Cheerleading for this and I don't understand why he's so sad about

2109
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,200
This is that he's really worried that the government is waste

2110
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,552
Digging to school

2111
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
There's

2112
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
This few million dollars could have

2113
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,184
Reallocate

2114
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Right

2115
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,536
So there's a soft cool going on shore

2116
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,072
Which there was in 2015

2117
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:44,192
Always always a f****** sofcu

2118
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,752
Who's like great-great-great Grand

2119
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,288
I don't know if this is

2120
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:53,408
Just restarted and it's a whole nother cool or whatever but apparently that's something to do with Yale

2121
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,456
Anyway here's Steve

2122
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
Whatever

2123
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,368
But you had Jerry Post in your psychiatrist you are trying to claim

2124
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,928
That Trump is not sincere

2125
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:05,696
On the other hand

2126
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:09,024
George Conway who

2127
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,840
And is the husband of Taliesin

2128
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
Conway

2129
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
Call Leanne Conway works at

2130
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,472
Straight East from Yale

2131
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:20,544
Posters from yeah I got back from Yale

2132
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:26,176
Woodward from bli got bushes from Miele I got Cheney from you

2133
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:29,760
I'm trying to

2134
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:33,344
Civil War or whatever you want to call it

2135
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,464
It's it's a sock because we're using military forces and Military

2136
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,536
Will not be in the business of

2137
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,840
Using military force if we have

2138
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:50,496
Play frankly now

2139
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:55,104
That's what I was doing with my feet

2140
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,944
Heather you've always been doing that you're doing on Alex's show and late

2141
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,784
2015 convince them to get bored of trump

2142
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:07,648
Who's all the ways that the narrative is the soft to going on and we've got a

2143
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Subvert democracy

2144
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,696
Percy in order to

2145
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,512
Yeah it's just

2146
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
And when you say who's we

2147
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
Always talks

2148
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,608
It's crazy

2149
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,424
He thought when he talks about the military he's like

2150
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,264
I've got a hundred thousand men overseas

2151
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,312
Nobody calling you

2152
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,616
God got to get Steve on the phone

2153
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,152
Yeah

2154
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,456
So the Democratic party is imploding

2155
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,040
Because this is

2156
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,576
Pretty much the only reference

2157
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
Prince to Bloomberg running

2158
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
And the shell when it comes

2159
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:44,768
So what you see in a sect is a very ineffectual of sheep

2160
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Party

2161
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:51,680
Self-destructing in the midst of what really is a republican Revolution

2162
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
The reason

2163
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
In the Democratic

2164
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,432
Democratic

2165
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,992
Bernie Sanders is a joke

2166
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,296
Warner New Hampshire

2167
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:11,136
Is the Socialist he's a multi-millionaire socialist from book

2168
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,672
Advances

2169
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:24,192
There's a reason

2170
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,240
Now she has no credibility

2171
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:30,592
And then you have the light whatever you want to call it a migas

2172
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:36,992
Work together and destroying the party so you really have nobody that has mentally

2173
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,296
He has a problem with an aneurysm

2174
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,624
All all of the people that he named beat drum

2175
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,416
International Falls

2176
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,952
Head2head

2177
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,744
So did Hillary.

2178
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,328
Fair enough but you understand

2179
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,168
The squad

2180
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:58,752
Because they aren't running for president

2181
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,336
I don't care about is

2182
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,640
Analysis

2183
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,712
They go to break

2184
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,528
And this is coming back from break I just make

2185
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:14,112
This is so hilarious nothing to do with Steve but this is so dumb

2186
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:20,512
Well Carpe donktum it mean world.com

2187
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,072
Thomas released amazing New Meme

2188
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
Infowars.com

2189
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
The triumphant

2190
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:34,080
Star Wars Museum right now

2191
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:40,224
Dr.

2192
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:46,624
Nothing says this meme grew organically like Alex Jones announcing it on Infowars

2193
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,768
Christ imagine that swelling music Alex comes back on music

2194
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:58,656
Carpe donktum got a new Reddit thread Cheese's I know right loading something

2195
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,728
Just f****** stupid most insignificant thing I

2196
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,800
Steve started out a little

2197
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
Slow

2198
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
He gets up speed real fast

2199
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:12,736
So Jeffrey Epstein died a lot of people have a lot of feeling

2200
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:15,552
I bet Steve's are really good

2201
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,880
There are people who say he's murdered

2202
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:24,256
Yeah there's some people who say he committed suicide right there's a third group of people

2203
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,072
There's a third group of people who are very crazy

2204
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,632
And Steven

2205
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,424
I was surprised that

2206
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,264
One General didn't do anything

2207
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,800
When asked

2208
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
Was Kill

2209
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:41,152
OSHA

2210
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,968
Can anyway slaughtered in another cell

2211
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:47,552
Epstein was part of the CIA

2212
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:53,952
And he knows well as I did William Barr that we take out our own people we send them overseas

2213
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,024
Sebastian

2214
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,608
Jeffrey Epstein the live out of the country

2215
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:04,448
I knew it well you know when

2216
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,312
Grand ideas of being a murderer or two popular

2217
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,616
You need to go further

2218
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:16,480
Someone like Steve so high

2219
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,760
For crazy that like

2220
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
You know what her to even

2221
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
Feel it he's coming

2222
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,416
He's got to go so much further than normal

2223
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
He's like man I got to do

2224
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
Three tabs ass

2225
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Get going

2226
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
But that's my phone into percent

2227
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,120
Yes but with b*******

2228
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,400
Steve

2229
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,448
Weather Consultants

2230
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,752
Initially at the state department in

2231
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
74

2232
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,872
Roulette like 2 years

2233
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:48,224
Until he British brought in as a deputy assistant Secretary of State

2234
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
He was in that position

2235
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
For a short. Of time

2236
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:57,696
But in this club deserted rewrites history fries now what his job was

2237
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,000
Is it was his job to come in and

2238
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:02,560
Fire everybody

2239
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:08,960
Most ruthless people people like me and

2240
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,008
Job with the state department

2241
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,360
What's the same thing in the intelligence community

2242
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:21,760
There is no such thing not knowing

2243
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,784
How to root these criminals

2244
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,672
Has brought in a fired every day

2245
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Dumbest

2246
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,280
Edwards people

2247
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,608
Who are the ones who brag about coming in and

2248
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:40,192
Firing Trump you guys are so f******

2249
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:45,568
So you know he fired a ton of people and it led to a situation where the state department

2250
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:50,432
That Steve was working people apparently

2251
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:56,576
Alex the irony is he's not as tough as he should have been you bringing guys like me or you

2252
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,856
We would get rid of them

2253
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:02,208
Why do I need 75,000 people in the state

2254
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:07,840
When I work for Kissinger we headed most 9 to 10 people

2255
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,400
And Henrietta

2256
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:17,568
What to do

2257
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,504
Man the state department has list of employees you can find pretty easily and Steve's numbers are nowhere near correct

2258
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:30,368
I have no idea what he's trying to express by saying the Kissinger had like 10 guys and that was a department

2259
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,928
But I suspect it's a reflection of how uninvolved

2260
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,720
Steve actually was in the bigger picture

2261
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:38,816
Like I would believe that his office had like 9 or 10 guys in it but man

2262
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:41,632
The state department is really big and it always has been

2263
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,168
How come you never added

2264
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
How come you never

2265
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,728
Honestly as the question

2266
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,264
Why does the state

2267
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
75000

2268
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,640
Ambassadors are part of the state department

2269
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:58,784
That's just one part of the state department you start to realize there's a ton of people working under that umbrella

2270
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,064
Put it bluntly

2271
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:00,832
Stephen Hawking

2272
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,856
Straight-up b*******

2273
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,392
This is nonsense

2274
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:07,232
Why is what why do you need 75,000 people working for them

2275
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,768
Cuz if there's a lot of s***

2276
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,304
What to do but a lot countries

2277
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,120
Is lot of intricate diplomacy

2278
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:15,680
Call that

2279
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,544
Says fire the state department

2280
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,784
Irrelevant

2281
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,112
I think even Alex is like hold on now

2282
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
That

2283
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:41,024
Crazy I hate you I hate big government but what you're advocating for is

2284
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,352
At least it's like

2285
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,144
It's not functional

2286
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,960
The state department being like a couple dudes

2287
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:55,360
What do you what do you need as a diplomat to know what it what are those what are those other countries called

2288
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:57,664
China what do you need a diplomat for

2289
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,968
I could see it working

2290
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
No I can't ever

2291
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,088
So you get to talkin about

2292
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:05,856
You know

2293
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,232
Rollie Rollie

2294
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,256
Maybe enriching them

2295
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,608
Steve Kerr

2296
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:20,960
Can Trump be saved in your view and what are the plays they're going to use against him

2297
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:28,128
They're going to use several things one it came out Jared Kushner Ivanka Trump have been south of grand

2298
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:31,968
Deal

2299
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:38,112
Saturday

2300
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:41,952
A business name

2301
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,488
A businessman

2302
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,280
Does what he has to do

2303
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:51,424
I don't care if he makes money

2304
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:54,496
What

2305
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,616
I think you might not be into that. Like

2306
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,944
These guys from love the Constitution

2307
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,272
Constitution

2308
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,928
The businessman he does what he has to do

2309
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,696
I would be

2310
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,488
To be a fly on the wall when a music

2311
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:21,120
Explain that to the entire intelligence community that he runs secretly apparently

2312
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
Okay

2313
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,912
Call Steve

2314
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,704
So man

2315
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,728
Steve

2316
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,544
Comes out real in favor of Putin

2317
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,080
Appearance

2318
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,664
Which isn't too surprising based on some of the stuff you were saying in like 20

2319
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
1627

2320
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,480
But it's a little

2321
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
Very

2322
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
Strong support here

2323
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:45,696
We have National Security interest National Security interest means business so when anybody

2324
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
Give me a break

2325
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,816
Number one I was involved in the Soviet Union

2326
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,608
We had an agreement

2327
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
That was in writing

2328
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,448
There is no such thing as the Russians

2329
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
Baited

2330
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Crimea

2331
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:03,872
What union Russia

2332
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
But you not to tell me

2333
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
Okay Steve

2334
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
Okay Steve

2335
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:08,992
Wow so

2336
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:10,272
It gets even crazier

2337
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:14,880
Strong

2338
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:23,072
Surprise

2339
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,456
Control

2340
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,504
The remainder of what was Russia

2341
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,856
It's becoming clear to me that Steve pieczenik is a megalomaniac

2342
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:52,256
While he presented world where he's been involved in literally every single thing that is that the stage for the world we live in.

2343
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,024
Coming to exist

2344
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,816
Yeah.

2345
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:59,680
India Tea Company that's how we spread the road lot of China

2346
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
Every piece on the chest

2347
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,336
We all think we have free will but in reality everything is been

2348
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,896
Steve all along

2349
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:09,920
Awards

2350
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,224
Universe I don't believe any of this yet

2351
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,112
And I definitely don't believe that Steve had anything to do with Putin's rise of the KTV

2352
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:24,000
Everything daddy the timeline just doesn't make sense

2353
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,792
Cb&i

2354
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:30,400
1975 and 1974 Steve just entered the state department as a Consulting

2355
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:34,240
He wasn't even the deputy assistant secretary until 1976

2356
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,032
This is all bulshit but it fits the

2357
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
Fuse pattern Sowell

2358
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
Kind of love it

2359
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:42,688
I could listen to the Alex get yelled at by this grandiose old man for days

2360
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,904
Yeah it'll when I was there at the

2361
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,184
The Gulf of Tonkin

2362
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,720
Okay god dammit

2363
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,536
Go go off

2364
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,120
So also in 2005 Steve Road and I paid for the American

2365
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,656
Intelligence Journal title Putin

2366
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,424
KGB

2367
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,192
Forever

2368
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:08,544
Which mysteriously doesn't mention him knowing anything about food before he became president of Russia

2369
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,360
Also super anti-putin

2370
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
You sure he didn't

2371
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,152
Carve that into a tree

2372
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Playa bowls

2373
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
Weather harder

2374
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:23,136
Took from that quote what is certain at this point in time is the Putin has muzzled the Russian press

2375
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:25,952
Sidelined rivals or jettisoned into prison

2376
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:26,976
He's Cafe

2377
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,304
Parliament prerogative as meager as they may have been

2378
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,168
And once again like all good KGB operatives he's disseminated intimidation and seek

2379
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,472
At once silencing domestic price

2380
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,264
For security reform and political account

2381
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
Possibility

2382
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,360
Steven that op-ed literally argues that America doing nothing

2383
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,640
Interviewing Putin's action

2384
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,176
As domestic issues

2385
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,712
Will lead to a quote

2386
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,992
Serious problem

2387
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,016
Did he describe

2388
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:57,184
Russia's Neighbors in Eastern and Central Europe will be justifiably concerned about political destabilization of their region

2389
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:02,048
What big country in Eastern Europe that was justifiably concerned about Russian

2390
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:04,864
Destabilization their country

2391
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
Maybe f***

2392
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,680
Ukraine I don't think so

2393
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:12,544
I don't think so I take everything back that I said the last episode that we did that where I said that

2394
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,824
Steve is consistent

2395
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,664
He's just consistent and hating neocon isn't that impressive

2396
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,712
He's deeply in consist

2397
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,480
Yeah

2398
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,296
Pretty anyway he installed

2399
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,600
That's pretty Dynamite that his

2400
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
Psyops

2401
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,160
Are still last

2402
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
Years ago he fuc

2403
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:33,280
The reason that he told everybody that was B

2404
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
Assume that they wouldn't

2405
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
Seriously

2406
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,608
Because he

2407
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Chosen Putin

2408
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,704
And of course as we know the globalist by law

2409
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,752
Have to announce what they are

2410
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,520
Doing

2411
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:46,080
Before they do it people have to tacitly a

2412
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,360
Green with that so dumb

2413
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,384
Steve pieczenik

2414
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,176
Cast to put it out in a journal

2415
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,224
That Putin is going to do what he's going

2416
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,528
To do years later we find we're here

2417
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,576
And in order to facilitate

2418
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,624
Continuing is power

2419
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,976
Steve now has to run a psyop saying that he's not using his power

2420
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
Perfect

2421
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,024
Easier explanation

2422
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,328
Steve

2423
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,888
So

2424
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,912
Alex

2425
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,448
To some extent I guess Steve

2426
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:18,848
Are pretty convinced that Mitt Romney is going to be the ringleader of the impeachment

2427
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,872
Do the Senate

2428
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,920
And do some real interesting

2429
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,320
Ashley in the self-destructive mode

2430
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,512
Who is a coward

2431
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:42,144
I said it years ago when he was on break but I meant Romney is the guy that's been

2432
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,032
So that's a very weird pairing of Santa

2433
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,616
Mitt Romney is not a republican he's not a Mormon

2434
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
Yep

2435
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
It's strange

2436
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,688
You know what it is

2437
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,712
It follows

2438
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Next clip where

2439
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,272
Steve is talking about how like we got

2440
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,296
Got to get a Mormon

2441
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,856
To neutralize the Romney

2442
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,672
Threatened

2443
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,464
Alright

2444
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,488
Yeah yeah

2445
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:14,400
And I would get rid of state and put in Jon Huntsman

2446
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
To the president

2447
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,456
At the same time he despises Mantronix I have a

2448
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Mormon

2449
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:32,064
Romney

2450
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:36,672
Can you sleep

2451
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:41,024
Better than year Mormons

2452
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:41,792
F***

2453
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,584
So weird

2454
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,656
Okay alright are we

2455
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:48,192
We're doing Secret Wars

2456
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,008
That's it we're doing a comic book mash-up event

2457
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,544
Where we've got

2458
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,872
Steve pieczenik used in the f****** Marvel Universe

2459
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:57,408
The DC Universe

2460
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:01,760
On the goddamn globalist side

2461
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:05,344
We've entered is in this part of Steve's interview with Alex

2462
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,368
He is

2463
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:09,184
Fantasy Baseball any Administration

2464
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,488
Guess what what

2465
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
Steve got a job okay

2466
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:15,584
ShopRite

2467
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,704
And clean out that entire White House get rid of

2468
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:24,800
Security Council

2469
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:30,944
Can start coming into the state department and start cutting down on the 16th

2470
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,952
And at the same time

2471
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,536
You set in motion and incredible counter-revolution

2472
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,328
People will say thank you

2473
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,120
Mr. president thank you

2474
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,656
Literally when he was describing it

2475
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:57,056
Is I will go into the White House and get rid of any and every possible oversight into what anybody dance

2476
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
Any possible to send exact

2477
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:03,200
Calling 4:00 knives

2478
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:07,296
So with all these constant talk of wanting to eliminate

2479
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,064
The intelligence

2480
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,672
Clearly screaming about their important to remind you that

2481
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,488
Emails that Wikileaks released in their Stratford table

2482
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,024
Steve breault

2483
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,840
Customer service email

2484
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,864
And said quote

2485
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Continue the great job

2486
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,936
We will not need our expense

2487
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,240
Ineffective bloated government agencies

2488
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,104
In 2004 Steve wrote an op-ed for the journal-american intelligence

2489
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,408
Arguing for a nearly complete

2490
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,712
Pleat Outsourcing of intelligence operation

2491
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
Do private company

2492
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:40,832
He is an insanely huge supporter of business is doing spy work

2493
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,368
Which I think is a pretty bad idea

2494
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,648
But here's the thing

2495
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,208
He never makes that actual argument on Alex's show

2496
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,768
He always present this stuff super disingenuous

2497
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:52,096
The goalies working towards is private intelligence company

2498
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:56,960
Are you spying on civilians like Stratford taking over a ton of the responsibilities of the US intelligence

2499
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,776
But instead of saying that on Alex's show

2500
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,800
Still say things like

2501
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,848
All these people at the CIA or doing nothing

2502
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,128
Couches

2503
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,920
Otis real motivation

2504
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:07,712
Is very clear from his actions

2505
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:09,504
It has been consistent over the years

2506
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:13,088
He's using Alex's anti-government leanings to his advantage

2507
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,672
No granted I believe that Steve is also fairly anti-government

2508
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:20,512
But I don't believe that this aspect of his character is based on some small government prints

2509
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,840
I have no idea exactly why you would want private

2510
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,120
Companies spying

2511
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:30,240
In the same way I have no idea why someone would take private armies like Blackwater would be an okay thing to have

2512
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,800
I can't mail down the exact explanation

2513
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
But I know for sure that it's

2514
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
Not good

2515
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:37,920
By elevating Steven helping him further his agenda

2516
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,968
Alex's wittingly or unwittingly

2517
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:42,784
Help move us closer to a world that is not more free

2518
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,320
And privacy is not more protect

2519
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
You'll just be

2520
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,416
For-profit businesses that are doing the bulk of the spying as opposed

2521
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
The government

2522
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
So cool

2523
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:53,536
This guy really is on the tip of the spear fighting against tyranny

2524
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,304
That is

2525
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,328
That is wild

2526
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,448
Steve loves

2527
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,984
Especially if they're

2528
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
Multiple

2529
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,776
Cuz it cuz

2530
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:08,896
The idea thereof would be like privatization means that intelligence agencies welcome

2531
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
With each other

2532
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,224
And whoever gets the best intelligence

2533
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:16,320
Is going to win out I can't see any problems with that that's that's

2534
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:22,464
Sing the torture gives you the best information you're going to get what you want to get out of it that's how the

2535
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,232
Booking

2536
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,000
Consumerism

2537
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,280
Picture of it

2538
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,840
You're not going to get the best information you can see

2539
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,120
Information you want

2540
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,192
Yep it'll be it would be

2541
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,984
Not good

2542
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
End

2543
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
Yep

2544
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,616
Anyway

2545
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,432
Steve seems to be calling for basically a

2546
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:47,040
Of people in these places that are

2547
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:51,136
Disloyal or oversight related

2548
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,696
And Alex seems to be on board with it

2549
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:55,488
24-hours all crime is

2550
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,584
Are the founders of Delta Force

2551
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,752
Jose Aldo Moro

2552
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,848
Choo choo choo choo

2553
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
Are you saying

2554
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:16,480
What's going on but your message the president

2555
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,808
And also your message to the president about we were just saying earlier

2556
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,880
Action some real head starting to roll

2557
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:29,280
This is going to energize everybody and it's going to guarantee I believe victory

2558
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:31,072
Because they have gotten away

2559
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:36,448
Would literally like a cat in your house pissing all over the furniture I mean these guys need to be whacked upside the head

2560
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
I agree

2561
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,312
Just a small Point as a cat friend

2562
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:44,384
Cohabitate or with Jack

2563
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,408
That's not how you

2564
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,432
Want a cat now

2565
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:49,248
That's that's how you create a very

2566
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,528
A meme cat

2567
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:55,904
You will break the bonds that you have with a cat if you discipline them through like physical violence or

2568
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,696
Or something

2569
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,232
Suggesting

2570
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
Doesn't work metaphor

2571
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:02,304
Doesn't work actually

2572
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,352
And you supporting the idea that sea

2573
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
Steve has a

2574
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:09,984
Would you gets into a little bit more here just screaming more about how he wants to fire everybody in

2575
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:19,968
Grandiose

2576
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,040
Empower

2577
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,064
Intern

2578
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:29,696
I would clean out all of the institutions I do not need 75,000 people in the state

2579
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:34,560
Department of the internet

2580
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,704
You can just email over

2581
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,384
Flat-side

2582
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,688
Stupid I am

2583
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,224
You know it's

2584
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
A testament to

2585
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
To Steve's ability

2586
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:55,808
That he can

2587
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,368
If you'd say that these are

2588
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,904
Spineless sycophants

2589
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,184
Who just want Power

2590
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
,

2591
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,536
What I would do if I had all this power

2592
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,376
Is help you retain all that power

2593
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,424
So the problem is

2594
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
Steve would do all day

2595
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
You fire everybody it'll be great

2596
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,312
Sycophantic power fantasy

2597
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,336
Trump

2598
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:22,688
Whose catchphrase is your fired rise too nice to fire everybody

2599
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,224
Solution to this problem

2600
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,248
McDonald's

2601
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272
Because

2602
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:33,184
I'm really worried you'll start screaming. Because this is infuriating because it's one of the most ludicrous thing

2603
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,464
I think I've ever heard someone

2604
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:35,488
Seriously suggest

2605
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,328
I'm going to say something that most people don't really understand

2606
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,864
Irony

2607
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,632
Trump

2608
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,936
Is it he's really a nice guy

2609
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:52,896
Afraid of firing people

2610
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,528
Ironically

2611
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:04,928
Melania is the one I would go to because she's the person I would trust the most came out of a communist

2612
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:07,488
System speaks fortified language

2613
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:13,632
She knows exactly what's going on in the White House

2614
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:19,776
So now we're going to have Melania fire everybody

2615
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:25,408
This spirals out of control two levels

2616
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:27,712
That I don't think anybody could ever imagine

2617
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,248
In his neck

2618
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:35,392
You were afraid I was going to I was going to your Starsky have your felberg of nowhere

2619
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,928
Somebody just said that we should

2620
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:40,768
All of this power to Milan

2621
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:47,168
Talk about that a little bit more in this life

2622
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:51,520
Please stop listening

2623
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:57,920
Speak it with the kids call this is these dudes are being horny on Main is that the term

2624
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,688
Some people use

2625
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:09,952
Melania's 1in the most

2626
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,512
Inserting a beautiful

2627
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
Super hot women

2628
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,456
Great

2629
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,856
This is great this is great stuff man I just rather

2630
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:43,488
These guys are so gross

2631
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:46,048
Like at one point Alex is like

2632
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,632
Yeah this isn't like one of those normal shows where people talk about that

2633
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,936
Bulshit this is realpolitik

2634
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:59,616
You guys are just talking about how hot you should fire everybody

2635
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:05,760
Turn me on

2636
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,040
But also

2637
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
She's big

2638
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,832
Halo mask

2639
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,112
I could intimidate

2640
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:13,184
Just get in there I'm not intimidated normally

2641
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:15,232
Yeah but the issue is

2642
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:19,840
Trump needs more Ruthless People in their viewing Melania is possibly a ruthless

2643
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
Person

2644
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,680
And Steve also brings up like she knows about communism

2645
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,448
Whatever

2646
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,496
B r b

2647
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,032
It's kind of funny that it makes me think

2648
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,056
Steve B B

2649
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:32,896
I'm trying to get at is we need to have

2650
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:36,736
People in there

2651
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,272
It sounds bizarre

2652
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:44,160
Supposed

2653
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:44,928
Top Cash

2654
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:50,304
No it's not he's he's sweet he's been sweet to everybody hehehe

2655
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,608
My wife

2656
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,168
Piano to congratulate

2657
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,448
Couple years ago

2658
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:02,848
Congratulations but honestly you and I

2659
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:06,432
Whites are expensive electron to the next one

2660
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Yikes

2661
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,552
Steve why is there expensive

2662
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:15,136
The old crow Taqueria legere

2663
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,000
Bitter bitter

2664
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,304
Is the word I would use for that

2665
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:27,168
Call boy

2666
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:30,496
Oh congratulations wives lyrics.

2667
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,824
Old creepy

2668
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,384
These two guys together

2669
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:40,736
I just Trucking gross gross old man there's no other way to put it

2670
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:44,320
I think is where we get into like

2671
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,344
Real Dane

2672
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,952
It's real silly for him to be like you know the lawn you should fire everybody

2673
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:50,976
Dumb

2674
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
Whatever

2675
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,376
This actually is advocated I guess you could say that like firing everybody of the state department and stuff

2676
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
Should anyone ask

2677
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
Act on that

2678
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,448
Incredibly

2679
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:03,008
Yeah but not this is all right

2680
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,544
You are out of line

2681
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,432
Is the Trump really needs to clean out his cabinet

2682
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:15,808
And without any excuse I need an attorney general who can

2683
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:19,136
Higher and higher I can't wait for the judicial

2684
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:24,000
Great believer in judges I am a great believer in an attorney general

2685
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:27,840
ASAP

2686
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:39,872
Literally doodoo process is one of the defining features of the West according to Alex along with private property owned

2687
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,896
Owning guns and Free Speech

2688
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:46,784
The very idea that you would allow someone to come on his show and express a desire to do away with due process is

2689
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,808
Incredibly tell

2690
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:52,672
You can't be philosophically in favor of due process and the Constitution did not allow that she

2691
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,440
The stand

2692
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:56,768
But of course Alex has been completely humbled by Steve

2693
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:59,840
And now Steve can do whatever the f*** he wants on this show

2694
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:03,680
Stephen Alex didn't ever really agree on a whole lot anymore you think about it

2695
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:08,544
Alex thought they did because he was f****** with him for years and blinding him with flattery

2696
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:11,616
But now Alex is much closer to Stevens Point of View

2697
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,664
Wanting to perform an internal coup

2698
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,200
Usher enough of power

2699
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:19,552
Now that Alex is reasonably certain that the president who would become the authoritarian ruler

2700
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,576
Is primarily Sim

2701
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,880
Sympathetic to heterosexual white Christian males

2702
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,904
You don't really give a

2703
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:25,696
That's kind of like

2704
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:30,048
Fermenting a coup to create an authoritarian state

2705
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,072
Kind of in line

2706
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
With a lot of the

2707
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:35,424
The stuff that Steve has been primarily interested in for a long time

2708
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:38,240
Provided it's the right kind of ruler

2709
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:40,800
So now they're far more in line than they used to

2710
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:43,360
Alex has been brought to that level

2711
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,896
We're going to Steve

2712
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,944
You can come on if you like to process doesn't work

2713
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,224
And Alex to be like

2714
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:51,040
Made my career yelling about due process

2715
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:55,392
But you know what degree with you on everything rid of it would defeat the globalist

2716
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,464
You know you've gotten to this point where everything

2717
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,488
Think you stand for me

2718
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:00,256
Nothing

2719
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,584
The more I think about it the more inclined I am towards the belief

2720
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:06,400
Steve is very responsible for the situation Alex

2721
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,168
Susan right now

2722
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,984
Like I mean he completely f***** up Alex's life

2723
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:10,752
Is what I mean

2724
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,800
It was Steve who first gave Alex

2725
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,640
The supposed inside information that confirms his conspiracies about 9/11

2726
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:19,200
It was Steve was the first person to tell Alex

2727
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
The victims and survivors of Sandy Hook were all actors

2728
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,552
It was Steve who helped convince

2729
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,832
Alex to support Trump

2730
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:27,904
By telling a b******* stories of a coup in a counter-coup that

2731
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:28,928
Needed Alex's help

2732
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,952
If we're going to make it

2733
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
We need your help

2734
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
If you text

2735
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,840
Steve out of the equation of Alex's show he probably wouldn't have made nearly as much money over

2736
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:39,680
Overtime but you also never would be in this sorry State he is in now

2737
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:43,008
He got f***** over by a manipulative psychopath

2738
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
And now because I want to slow dance

2739
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Turn audience

2740
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:50,944
He's got to go crawling back to that same toxic influences he managed to avoid for over a year

2741
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
Then for what

2742
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,552
Most of Steve's videos on YouTube get like 20,000 views

2743
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:58,112
If that's enough for Alex to go chasing

2744
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,160
And come to the point where you like letting someone be like

2745
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,952
Due process doesn't work

2746
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:04,768
Alex's in way worse shape than we were even

2747
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
Yeah

2748
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:07,072
Man it just

2749
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,096
Ever

2750
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,376
Say the time

2751
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,656
Type of government that he would

2752
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,424
Prefer

2753
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,216
I mean you just call it a republic

2754
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,752
Yeah you're fine I mean

2755
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,520
Literally

2756
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:17,824
A fascist

2757
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:23,456
He's like a combination of the corporate spy Ajax with an authoritarian leader

2758
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,480
Yeah what is the

2759
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
What we should

2760
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,296
To do is we should have a

2761
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,832
Small group of oligarchs

2762
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,368
Wauconda politburo

2763
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:34,464
And will have them all fight each other for my approval

2764
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,000
And if they lose it

2765
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:42,400
Then I will kill them and erase them from photographs

2766
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:48,800
There's if this leader that we have is a business person who's directly altering the way they operate in order to further their

2767
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:50,080
Business

2768
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
Nobody's ever seen

2769
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,688
Corrupt billionaires

2770
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,224
It's deals are mutually

2771
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,296
Xclusive definitely didn't set one up and Rush

2772
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
Cheats

2773
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
Is Christ

2774
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,624
Yeah I mean

2775
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,184
Yeah that's the reality of like what Steve want

2776
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
And yeah

2777
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,512
Presenting it as there is this

2778
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:12,352
Cool of the Yale globalist or whatever

2779
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,120
It's such

2780
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,680
Just serious thing that we need to do all of the

2781
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:17,216
This stuff that's counter to

2782
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
What Arkansas

2783
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,264
The fusions are based on

2784
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,592
Operating as in order to eliminate this threat

2785
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,360
That's

2786
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,128
Lasek

2787
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:27,200
Dictatorship the only way to save the

2788
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,736
The tution is to

2789
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:29,760
Temporarily

2790
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,832
Suspended entirely

2791
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:39,232
Temporarily we just got it look we're going to put it to put a pause

2792
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,584
And then we'll bring it right back once we get everything cleared up don't worry

2793
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,120
It's just going to be a dictatorship

2794
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:46,912
That works

2795
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,680
The world

2796
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:49,984
So earlier we heard

2797
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,032
Steve say that the Epstein still alive

2798
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:54,336
Talk about that a little more now

2799
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
Anna

2800
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,640
I think he's starting to swim

2801
02:02:57,152 --> 02:03:01,248
Didn't die in prison

2802
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:06,880
Nobody

2803
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,864
There's a big deal to have you cuz I respect you and you don't

2804
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,168
So wow

2805
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:23,264
Yeah Alex is starting to come around to that that which is crazy

2806
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,848
You don't BS on air if it weren't for you I would

2807
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:27,616
Know that

2808
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,432
Osama bin Laden died from Marvin Sapp

2809
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:35,552
All of the things that I can think of that were major

2810
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:37,088
Gas

2811
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:41,184
Analysis career a lot of them have to do with Steve same bulshit on air

2812
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:46,560
But he hasn't been on the show in over a year because he said that the Las Vegas shooting didn't happen right

2813
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,352
That's b******* that he said on air

2814
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:52,448
Yeah his whole career is defined by bulshit that he says on air

2815
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:54,240
I guess the family of apes

2816
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,520
Aunt Sue him for

2817
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:56,544
For defamation by

2818
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,824
Listing that he's alive

2819
02:03:58,336 --> 02:03:59,616
And I suppose that's

2820
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,896
Probably not

2821
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:03,456
I suppose I suppose they're in the clear with that law

2822
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
Fly

2823
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:08,064
It starts out with Steve saying some slurs

2824
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,088
About lesbians

2825
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:12,160
In relation to Hillary so heads up for that

2826
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,768
Any pivots in

2827
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,560
To defending

2828
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,328
Trump being

2829
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,120
Incredibly corrupt

2830
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,520
And is it that I personally couldn't care less she was highly complex

2831
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:31,872
United Airlines

2832
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,408
Again bonus miles

2833
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:36,480
Highly compromised

2834
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:46,208
Mainland Chinese

2835
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:50,048
My CIA operatives came when he won the election against Bush

2836
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,840
And said to me

2837
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:56,960
In New Hampshire be able to be praising I Stay

2838
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:59,520
And they said he robbed the election

2839
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,056
Yep corruption

2840
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:04,640
Permeating

2841
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:12,832
He's a businessman he's a businessman

2842
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:15,136
Those are the exact type of people that like

2843
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,672
Happy corrupt

2844
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:19,232
So now let's just say okay

2845
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,256
Now what

2846
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,536
Oh no

2847
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,584
Let's just

2848
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:33,312
Well then in that case of course it's okay the personal brand is a bird that is corruption on all sides

2849
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,104
Dad and with trumpet

2850
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,640
Fine if he's corrupt

2851
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:39,968
It's with other people who don't have a white mask

2852
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:45,600
Nationalist agenda I don't their corrupt I'm very mad about I don't disagree that there is corruption

2853
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
All around

2854
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,416
And plenty to go around on both sides

2855
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:51,232
I don't disagree with that prescription at all

2856
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,768
I take issue with

2857
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,816
Top is cool with it.

2858
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,352
Cuz he's a businessman

2859
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:58,144
Go fuc yourself

2860
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,704
That is such a flimsy lineup

2861
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,496
We cannot have public servants

2862
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,776
Be corrupt

2863
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:09,920
But if your business when your business man come on we're just doing some business

2864
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:10,688
So

2865
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:12,480
Alex takes the opportunity of having

2866
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,784
Devon to ask him a little bit about Q

2867
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:15,808
Qanon

2868
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:16,832
And they both

2869
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,624
To have the

2870
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,696
Impression that it's not good because it gives false hope

2871
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:23,744
Which is interesting I hate

2872
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:26,048
It's interesting because I don't

2873
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:28,352
Totally disagree with that on some level

2874
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,888
But the problem is

2875
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,680
They are against this false hope

2876
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:32,448
Because they need

2877
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:34,240
Trump to be ruthless

2878
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:38,080
Again is about firing all these people

2879
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:42,944
I just

2880
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:43,968
Don't like things

2881
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,784
Everything's wonderful stick with the plan

2882
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:50,368
Invincible they're all about to go to prison

2883
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:52,672
And then it doesn't happen

2884
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:54,208
And the things are true

2885
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,304
When we're really working and really getting things done and exposing moles in the White House

2886
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,096
CDs

2887
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,144
Welders this nebulous

2888
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:05,984
Imperial that you got about out too it's a 4chan board

2889
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,264
That's all I'm saying is

2890
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,800
People need to know that

2891
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:11,360
Is in perilous times

2892
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:17,248
And that he needs to be pressured to take action as you said because that you can take the action is the president

2893
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:20,320
The mythical thing telling you that actions been taken

2894
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:28,000
I agree with you because I'm saying that the following people were arrested and this is going to come out now

2895
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:31,328
Alex

2896
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:35,680
Alan wants to remain president and he's got to beat

2897
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:38,496
He's got to be tough

2898
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:47,712
He has to what he has to do because

2899
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,528
She and I think a wife

2900
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:52,576
What the f***

2901
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:58,464
Steve has decided that he and Melanie are simpatico they're on the same page

2902
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,256
This is the ramblings of a

2903
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,816
I thought it was crazy before

2904
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,424
I thought it was crazy but him just being like a

2905
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:12,288
Fun like usual suspects kind of crazy words

2906
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:18,688
Grab games and having a grand old time coming up with ways to try and like stop the news

2907
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:24,064
Gioconda Jen do that

2908
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,600
Melania

2909
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,392
I have no doubt in my mind

2910
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:29,440
Melania thinks like me

2911
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,208
Is the

2912
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:32,512
I don't think anybody says that

2913
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,816
It's it's pretty trouble

2914
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:35,584
Planet who has

2915
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:41,472
Interesting things I never expected that Steve would come back on after over a year of being gone

2916
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:47,872
And a lot of it would be about how great Melania is and how Trump needs to get her to fire everybody

2917
02:08:48,128 --> 02:08:50,176
Because he's too weak to do itself

2918
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:54,016
He is really delivering on the promise of Steve pieczenik feedback on info

2919
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:57,856
Yeah and here is the cherry on top of Melania story

2920
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,928
National Security advisor

2921
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:01,952
Melania

2922
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:08,352
She would be the key point in that

2923
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,888
Okay so we got

2924
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:16,288
Melania in is a national security advisor we got Jon Huntsman and his secretary of state because he's

2925
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,824
Richard boarman

2926
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:24,736
Mitt Romney we got Steve pieczenik doing something where he yells at everybody in fire site will

2927
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:27,040
This is not a good White House

2928
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,064
I can

2929
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:28,832
I can't think

2930
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:30,624
Of a worst government

2931
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,648
Then whatever it is

2932
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,416
Steve pieczenik

2933
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:33,952
What is the best gun

2934
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:37,024
Yeah that's pretty bad

2935
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,816
Yeah that's an accomplishment

2936
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,096
Yeah yeah

2937
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:43,168
In some ways to have the worst idea is better than two

2938
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,192
Did just have a bad I

2939
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:47,264
It's impressive

2940
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:51,104
Yeah we have one last clip and it's Steve

2941
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
Expressing with his expectation

2942
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:54,176
Can was when Trump got elected

2943
02:09:54,688 --> 02:10:00,320
Doesn't stop

2944
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,344
Control

2945
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
TubeMate

2946
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,208
Begging

2947
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:06,976
Is

2948
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:10,304
He'd be what he was supposed to be from the very beginning

2949
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,680
Ruthless without any explanation or any rationalization

2950
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:21,824
That's all we asked of him the minute he does he will come in on 20/20

2951
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,848
If he has

2952
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,456
Call Betsy Ross

2953
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:30,016
We put them in there to be a strong man

2954
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:35,392
Consolidate power that really is maybe they

2955
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:36,160
The best

2956
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:38,720
Explanation for his

2957
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,512
Voter bases like

2958
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,072
We elected you to be our ID

2959
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:48,704
Yeah we are we elected you to be the swirling mass of hate and

2960
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,472
Tents

2961
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:52,032
May act as a wrecking ball again

2962
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:53,056
That's the sort of

2963
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:57,152
What we would call liberal social games that have been made over the last

2964
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,688
5060 years

2965
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,480
Rollback all kinds of protect

2966
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:02,272
For vulnerable communities

2967
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:07,648
Takeaway reproductive Healthcare you know do all of this stuff that we want done

2968
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:12,768
Don't answer questions about why you're doing it yet never apologize

2969
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:14,560
And if you do that we will be

2970
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:17,888
Be totally fine with you sure enough all the power that you want Act

2971
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:20,192
Chicken the most corrupt ways imaginable

2972
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,472
Who gives a s***

2973
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:24,288
And you know what the problem is always doing

2974
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,056
Corrupt

2975
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:31,456
I may still have to defend them that's a bummer for that

2976
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:36,576
Steve are melania's NSA would certainly help quite a bit

2977
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:37,344
The f*** are we

2978
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:38,368
Yeah

2979
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,136
Yep

2980
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:45,024
After what the clips I want explain to you why I think that this episode is such a good demonstration

2981
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,072
The holistic awfulness of Alex's

2982
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:52,448
Throughout this episode we seen a very clear example of five distinct behaviors

2983
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:57,568
Alex engages in regularly that are destructive to the public Consciousness and discourse

2984
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:00,128
The first is that he creates narrative

2985
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
Wheatley and

2986
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,432
Totally out of thin air

2987
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:03,456
That are

2988
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,480
Separate from real

2989
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:09,856
We saw this and Alex's insistence that Hillary Clinton is secretly running for president and is announced the

2990
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:10,624
But she gets

2991
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,696
This isn't real but Alex needs it to be real because it's

2992
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:16,768
Easier for him to work against this imagination of Hillary

2993
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
Beneduce room

2994
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:19,840
Create a whole new villain out of Elizabeth Warren

2995
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:22,912
Or to try and figure out how to thread the needle about Bernie

2996
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,704
I guess just too difficult for him

2997
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Hillary Clinton

2998
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:27,520
An evergreen bad guy

2999
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,568
So he creates a fictional reality

3000
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:31,872
People get to live in

3001
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:35,712
The second is whitewashing and strawmanning for races

3002
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:38,528
We saw this announced yelling about Disney

3003
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,576
Putting warnings on their movies about racist

3004
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,648
What you pretended we're just we're warnings

3005
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:44,928
But heteronormative

3006
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:50,304
We further saw this into way he turned a story about that Bristol hospital withdrawing treatment

3007
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,352
Racist into a story about tonight

3008
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,376
Care for right winger

3009
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:56,448
This is a clear pattern that he has whitewashing

3010
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,728
Strawmanning

3011
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,264
Turning them into different issues

3012
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,288
So the audience

3013
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,312
Is comfortable insta

3014
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,592
Supporting racism

3015
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,616
Pretending they're doing

3016
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Something else

3017
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:06,176
Yeah I with that one

3018
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:06,944
What I

3019
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,224
What I find

3020
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
So clear now is

3021
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,112
I don't even know if he's

3022
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,136
Emergence

3023
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,160
Be doing this reflects

3024
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,696
Sibley and it may have been

3025
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,512
At first but now I just

3026
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:21,536
See him as like

3027
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,816
Actually associate

3028
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,352
Getting those two together it might be

3029
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:27,936
Just purely like hey if you're not letting me say racist

3030
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:28,960
Texas things

3031
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:30,240
You are discriminating a

3032
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:32,288
Right-wingers possible

3033
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:36,384
The effective it is the same it really doesn't matter if it's so conscious

3034
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:38,432
I think he just doesn't even know anymore

3035
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,968
It's an academic question

3036
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:40,736
I'm not sure

3037
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,808
The third element is overt on hand

3038
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,856
Understand completely wrathful bigotry

3039
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:49,184
He's screaming about trans people or drag performers being so

3040
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:54,048
Satanic aliens is a level of hate that is so far past what any decent person would consider acceptable

3041
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:56,096
His claims that he's not a bigot

3042
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,144
She claims that

3043
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,704
What are you doing flies so far past just

3044
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,240
It's outright in

3045
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,008
Incitement

3046
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:05,824
It's important for people to understand that element to his rider

3047
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,408
The fourth thing is that Alex is a dumb f***

3048
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
Conspiracy theorist

3049
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:16,576
But he's super smug about those things everything that s*** up

3050
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,112
He's a Wizard of Oz

3051
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:21,696
Hiding behind imaginary folders full of evidence he'll never show you

3052
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:27,840
Alex seduces his audience into believing he knows what he's talking about with that mystery folder and a couple of headlines

3053
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:30,144
As it appeared to be in line with his conspiracies but

3054
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,168
Definitely art

3055
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:38,080
As a sub-point on this one we also see how Alex is very often using his conspiracy theories that he spreads for his own son

3056
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:38,848
Selfish purposes

3057
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:44,224
The only reason you did that whole dumb chemtrail segment is because he wants to go back on Rogan's podcast

3058
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:47,040
To get more listeners we don't go broke

3059
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:49,856
He's been so enabled and rewarded for this order

3060
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:52,160
From tationil bulshit behavior in the past

3061
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
Mixtiles

3062
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:54,976
Nothing like this again

3063
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:55,744
Absolutely

3064
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,280
The last element

3065
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:59,584
Is platforming dangerous lunatic

3066
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:02,656
Steve pieczenik is completely insane

3067
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,704
These masquerades around as an expert

3068
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:09,568
Injustice episode these are the things he's put forth while being presented as a respect

3069
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,336
Edible credible

3070
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,384
Epstein isn't dead

3071
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,944
Putin the super awesome and Russia should have Crimea

3072
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,736
The entire State Department should be fired

3073
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,528
Trump should eliminate the intelligence

3074
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:20,832
Melania should be made Nationals

3075
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,856
Security advisor

3076
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,416
Trump gets to be as corrupt as he wants because he's a business

3077
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:26,464
We should get rid of due process

3078
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:31,072
And Trump needs to ruthlessly Shore up our overall areas of the government

3079
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,400
A person advocating stuff like this isn't

3080
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,680
Same extremist

3081
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:40,544
They're supporting positions that are a direct contradiction to the foundations of our

3082
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:41,568
Constitution

3083
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:43,616
Enter the exact sort of things you B

3084
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:46,176
To hear from someone who's trying to install attic

3085
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:48,992
But instead of presenting the situation honest

3086
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:51,808
Play It's presented as if the things you're pushing for her actually

3087
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,088
Support of democracy

3088
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:54,368
In the will of the people

3089
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,928
This is very basic propaganda stuff

3090
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,744
You install a strongman Dictator by created

3091
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,536
The perception that a greater evil

3092
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:03,072
You know they exist

3093
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:05,120
The only strongman dictator can

3094
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:07,680
It's literally what these dudes are doing

3095
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:09,984
101

3096
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,520
These are the five elements

3097
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:13,056
Veterans so consist

3098
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:13,824
Through Alex's

3099
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:15,104
Career that are put on

3100
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,920
Start display on this November 13th episode

3101
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,224
And I recognize Alex Jones

3102
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:22,016
Is not the most relevant person in the world

3103
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,368
His reach isn't nearly what it wasn't past years and all indications seem

3104
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,648
To suggest that he's gone bro

3105
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:28,928
And that's fair

3106
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:31,232
But I don't think that it makes this any less concern

3107
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,024
These 5 bullet points

3108
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,048
Are not unique

3109
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:34,816
To Alex

3110
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,096
And the thing is

3111
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:36,864
This is

3112
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:38,144
Like it's not like

3113
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,936
I'm kind of a special episode where Alex

3114
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,216
Decided to play the hits

3115
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,496
Most of his jokes

3116
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:44,544
Contains most or all of these elements

3117
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,848
It was just particularly glaring when I was listen

3118
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:50,176
Some of this episode today worthwhile to bring an added Focus

3119
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,992
These are consistent and regular planks

3120
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:53,760
Of his program

3121
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:54,784
And they're all talks

3122
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,320
To the health of public discourse

3123
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:00,160
Alex Jones going off air won't solve any of these

3124
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:02,720
They've gone far too mainstream at this point

3125
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:04,256
And you see these same patterns

3126
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,792
The countless other conspiracy in

3127
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:06,816
Extremist Jose

3128
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:09,376
I could be incredibly wrong about this but

3129
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:12,448
Imagining that any single one of those Outlets going away

3130
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:14,752
Isn't going to do any good you know

3131
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:15,776
It's just not

3132
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:20,128
But understanding how they operate and why they operate the way they do

3133
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:21,664
Seems like it might be a way.

3134
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,944
Take power out of this prop

3135
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:24,736
So

3136
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,064
I just wanted to put that bow on this in

3137
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:29,856
Reflect

3138
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,624
A little V

3139
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,672
It's so obvious

3140
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,952
On this episode

3141
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,744
The thief specific

3142
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:37,024
Discreet

3143
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,560
Things that are being done

3144
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:40,352
It's almost even segments

3145
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,936
You know the khazar is the portion where he's doing the Race

3146
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:50,336
The hospital or around the same part of the show

3147
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,896
Then a whole segment of conspiracy theory

3148
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:54,176
Bulshit

3149
02:17:54,432 --> 02:17:57,760
Steve pieczenik gets a good hour at the end of the show

3150
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:01,600
There is there is almost like all right we're hitting these bases

3151
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,136
And it's not always like that

3152
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,208
A lot of times it too much more scattershot throughout the episode

3153
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:09,536
It's a smaller but he did hire the program man

3154
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,072
Colbert

3155
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:14,144
So everything is really structured pretty well there's a

3156
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:16,448
Solid situation there

3157
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,496
Do you do your point about

3158
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:21,312
Getting rid of these media

3159
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,848
Empires creator

3160
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:24,384
Solely to push this

3161
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,664
Propaganda

3162
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,200
I think that goes right back

3163
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:29,504
To where we are with weather weaponry

3164
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:33,600
That is The Logical endpoint of our curiosity

3165
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:38,464
It is not going to it is not going to just go away the

3166
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,000
Is there

3167
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:42,816
There it requires last doing something

3168
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:43,840
Where is learning

3169
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:46,144
Control restraint

3170
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:47,168
Constant watch

3171
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:52,288
Parallel for what you were talking about with other weapon

3172
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,824
Would be like outlawing

3173
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,360
This kind of research

3174
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:59,456
And that is the sort of things that I think is detrimental to

3175
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:04,320
Humanity brighten the same way out or something

3176
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,344
Dangerous

3177
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:06,880
Kind of tone

3178
02:19:07,136 --> 02:19:10,464
In the world than good

3179
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,488
Whereas

3180
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:13,024
Everyone doing

3181
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:16,096
Deep soul-searching about how you use x technology

3182
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,632
Everybody doing some

3183
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,680
Some hard work

3184
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:22,752
Maybe maybe it's not that hard on understanding

3185
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:24,544
How this manipulation

3186
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,616
A long way towards

3187
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:28,896
Allowing this to steal

3188
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,176
Exist in the world

3189
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:33,504
Increasing the possibility that it can be effectively used

3190
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,784
DJ Lance

3191
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,064
And maybe

3192
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,112
That's not Eva

3193
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:39,904
Yeah maybe

3194
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:42,208
What is the position I'm living in right now

3195
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:44,000
I don't know if that'll cheer

3196
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:46,816
But it's the sort of conclusion

3197
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,096
I find myself

3198
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:57,312
Laundry list of things that he would prefer in a government

3199
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,592
Is that

3200
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:00,384
It seems like

3201
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:01,408
If somebody else

3202
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,432
What's gives you 1

3203
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:03,968
Of those same

3204
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:08,576
But they would desire you know if somebody's like I want Trump to have that too

3205
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:09,856
Control and Fire

3206
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,392
People in be more ruthless

3207
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,928
You can guess the

3208
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:15,744
They're also on board with a few of of the other one

3209
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:19,072
Maybe not Melania Trump being at SC but

3210
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:24,448
Call me also Imagine imagine the reaction that Steve or Alex would have if like

3211
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,496
Some Obama surrogate

3212
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:29,056
Boston process

3213
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,848
If Obama nominated

3214
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,128
Michelle to

3215
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:37,248
Any position it would be

3216
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:40,064
Yeah it would be an armed Resurrection right

3217
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,136
To the

3218
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,208
These sorts of things that are so far beyond the pale of

3219
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:46,976
Acceptable

3220
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:49,536
Become acceptable because you know you got your guy

3221
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:51,584
Exact you got the guy who is going to

3222
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,120
Your interests

3223
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:53,888
Secure

3224
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:55,168
Wow attacking

3225
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,216
Or allowing a text

3226
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:59,264
Two vulnerable communities that you want

3227
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,032
To be targeted

3228
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:01,312
As long as he does

3229
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:03,104
You want him to do you cook

3230
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:04,896
A blind eye to every

3231
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:07,968
Even as he destroys you because

3232
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:09,504
Con man

3233
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,040
Same way that you're at

3234
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,576
These people are

3235
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:15,136
So stupid it's a mess

3236
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,208
And fun as some of these Steve coming back

3237
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:20,256
Is Dora's real f******

3238
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:21,536
Messed up thing

3239
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:25,376
That he's suggesting and pushing on the show and Alex's seconding

3240
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:29,216
And allowing to be presented as credible which is a real f****** mess

3241
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:30,496
And I hate it

3242
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:32,800
The same time I would be lying if I said

3243
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,848
That it wasn't way more fun to live

3244
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:35,872
Listen to this episode

3245
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:39,200
Not the part where he's yelling about trans people being demons

3246
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,736
But like the part where

3247
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:43,040
Steve is on is so much more listenable

3248
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:45,088
Then

3249
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,392
What are you saying

3250
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:48,672
You put in poop

3251
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,440
And here's a

3252
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,232
It's dark

3253
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
It's real dark and

3254
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,048
Maybe if you took it if

3255
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:58,144
You took it anywhere near as seriously as you would that f****** okay

3256
02:21:58,656 --> 02:21:59,424
A guy segment

3257
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:00,448
You be like

3258
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,216
This s*** is

3259
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
Is terrifying

3260
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,520
Steve

3261
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:06,848
Interesting

3262
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:08,128
Character

3263
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,712
Pinata

3264
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:18,112
You're calling for a dictatorship in the end of the Constitution to Tire lady

3265
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:21,696
Crazy you're crazy for this one story

3266
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:24,000
You keep it going

3267
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:26,560
Welcome back Steve
