Dan  00:58
Hello, everybody. Welcome back now. I'm Jordan. Dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of saline and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Oh, indeed.

Jordan  01:08
We are Dan Jordan. Dan, Jordanne

Dan  01:10
quick question for you. Yeah. What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot today Jordan isn't actually a bright spot, but it's sort of a half.

Jordan  01:19
All right. Okay. It's the rules of the game.

Dan  01:22
It's right here. It is. Fanta. Oh boy. I saw that they have a flavor called hashtag what if? What's the Fanta what the Fanta? What the Fanta

Jordan  01:33
you can name a flavor with a hashtag that is that I call foul. Just call foul.

Dan  01:40
That might not actually be the name of it might be question mark because it says find clues hashtag what the Fanta.

Jordan  01:45
Oh my god.

Dan  01:46
we're drawn to these curious flavors as we talked about in the last episode. Dream Land shared dream world coke. Yeah. Also got a number of messages for people who are like, Hey, you got that space coke. It's got to be at the store. Right?

Jordan  02:03
I don't understand how dealer not what did that happen?

Dan  02:07
Not gonna happen. But yeah, I'm drawn to these things. And you know, Fanta you got like, pineapple, orange, but a fruit flavors.

Jordan  02:17
Only thing I know about Fanta is the commercial from the early. That's the only thing Yeah, I don't think I've ever had a Fanta despite the commercial asking me if I want one. I do not.

Dan  02:29
It's fruit. Yes. Right. All of them are fruit. Sure. So you're expecting fruit here? Bachelor. I think it's cotton candy.

Jordan  02:36
You think it's cotton candy? Oh, no. You can't have that big of a heel turn

Dan  02:41
my friend candy. That was not a fruit. I can tell you that. For sure. Yeah, I think it's cotton candy

Jordan  02:48
or whatever. It's cotton candy grapes.

Dan  02:51
They taste like cotton candy and the grapes. That's a fruit. That would be an interesting technicality. It would be an interesting technicality. All right, that I'll put that down. Just because that helps. Okay, that makes my guess a little bit more sensible. Yeah. I like grapes. Grapes rantzau.

Jordan  03:06
Well done. Also, it's not good. No. Well, poorly done job fair to get your shit together.

Dan  03:13
What's your work? But I you

Jordan  03:15
know, I didn't even want to necessarily tell you but it begins with a tee and ends with tennis.

Dan  03:19
Serena?

Jordan  03:21
Well, I mean, that was a beautiful moment I was

Dan  03:25
gonna give you because, you know, the monumental was he was emotionally effective for Serena Williams to retire. Such a good match to one of the greats.

Jordan  03:37
Not one of the greats. The greatest I think.

Dan  03:41
I think that a good I don't know enough about tennis to say and I'm fully willing to agree with you. Yeah. I just think it's as someone who knows nothing about the sport, right? Definitely saved. Top Players of All Times for sure. Yeah, you are an expert. So I'll tell you to

Jordan  03:57
wade into the endgame argument of like, oh, is it Pippin or Zubia? Yeah, I get it. I get.

Dan  04:04
I just have feelings about the Pete Sampras. From my youth.

Jordan  04:10
What feelings

Unknown Speaker  04:11
my memory

Jordan  04:13
actually, as a man with a substantial arm hair. I imagine that you do have a lot to go Sure.

Dan  04:19
Robin Williams one of the great tenants.

Jordan  04:24
Why didn't he make a biopic

Dan  04:26
all it takes to be good at tennis is arm hair samples. Robin Williams Sampras, Adams. Yeah, I like that. McEnroe. Yeah, he's

Jordan  04:37
still he's still around. You know what he narrates a TV show? Does a yellow bunch. No, it's just like a regular narration that is John McEnroe. With no like, they just, it's never even addressed. They're never like, hey,

Dan  04:51
it's John McEnroe. That is narrating it used to be the guy who yells thing he's

Jordan  04:55
known frankly, that's his job, but whatever. You know, it's crazy. What

Dan  04:59
Oh, I'm in that house of pain song jumping around has References John McEnroe.

Jordan  05:06
That's not crazy. John McEnroe. What's the biggest thing in the world for a very short period of time?

Dan  05:12
I'm saying that time Oh yeah, it was a long time ago.

Jordan  05:16
That was a long time anyway,

Dan  05:17
I'm sorry I've hijacked your bright spot.

Jordan  05:19
My bright spot is the US Open scrape. Oh, yeah. So test. How's it going? I really think this is one of the best ones I've seen in a long long time. Like top to bottom. Everybody is good. Is that young kid? You like doing wildcards? Yeah, yeah, he's headed to the quarterfinals. My man he's crushing it Rafa, of course is crushing it

Dan  05:38
is US Open taking place in San Francisco around the bay and he is now Torres doesn't go down to trail. Dough. He's

Jordan  05:47
that dad. I already saw that coming from a mile away. Yeah. Or if it San Francisco from 1400 miles away.

Dan  05:56
So where are they at? In terms of the No, I mean, like in terms of the finals, I mean,

Jordan  06:04
the fourth route the final day or so before the fourth round is the quarterfinals and then so, so the fourth round is the round of 16. Okay, the round right before the quarterfinals. 16 Tonight is probably going to be the best match of the entire tournament. curios versus Medvedev. Kyrios crushing it for the first time in his life on the Russia No. Different areas different Medvedev? Okay. But yeah, it's gonna be a great one.

Dan  06:36
I would love it. If just to fuck with you. The US Open was still at like, three in the morning.

Jordan  06:44
That would be great. Awesome. That would be great. Same time as the French. Yeah, exactly. All tennis is set up at exactly the same time as they are

Dan  06:51
the French Open. I just have a number of memories of you being like, I'm gonna be up all night.

Jordan  06:58
I woke up at 3am. So I can be up until 4am tomorrow night. In order

Dan  07:03
to watch this at a bar. I have to go to the airport. That's true. It just assumed that that's what it's like to be a tennis fan to say you're always watching two

Jordan  07:14
illegal streams help.

Dan  07:15
I I feel like a number of wrestling fans have the same sort of thing with like Japanese promotions, pay per views and stuff.

Jordan  07:25
You gotta make sacrifices to love something, I guess. Guess. Yeah.

Dan  07:29
So Jordan. Today, we're gonna be talking about a present day episode. Okay. We're checking back in because the bat signal went up. Oh, something very important happened. That Biden gave that speech. What speech?

Jordan  07:41
I heard people talking about a speech that Biden gave. I can't tell if you're joking. No, I mean, I know about the speech, but it's like I just don't understand. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, nevermind. Yeah, that was it. I really thought that they were part of it. But it's just the it looks,

Dan  08:02
it looks No, I actually, I mean, we can get into a little bit now. And we'll get into more during the episode and such, but I think that the speech is either going to be historically incredibly relevant, or not, but an attempt to be very historically relevant. It's tough. Yeah, I'm not sure exactly how the ball is gonna break at this point. But he gave a speech that was essentially like, hey, look, here's the situation. Trump, and the people who were following him, these Maga folks are a mess. Yeah, they don't care about democracy. Right. And they have a very serious threat to democracy as we are experiencing it now. And the stability of the country, us normal folk, right? Democrats, independents, Republicans who aren't into that nonsense, right? We have a responsibility to do what we can to protect democracy now. The future generations will look back. Sure as us being in the fight, right. If we do our job, they will look at this point. As an inflection point in history. Yeah. You know, there was there were a number of things that are I would say, a little bit overdue in terms of recognition of hey, look, this shit is nonsense. Fascism is bad. Right. Well, and you know, previously, he had called folks semi fascist. Yeah. So, there is there is like a little bit of a Ah, finally some of this is that these words are being uttered. Right? Right. Right. It's at least out in the air. Right. And, you know, the, there is an aspect of like man's might be too little too late. That is definitely present. And there's also an element of like, what does this even really mean? Like, is this going to push any needles any in any direction? Or is this going to be something that has just a severe backlash Uh,

Jordan  10:00
who knows? In my, in my humble opinion, the only reason that a president should give a speech is as cover for somebody to arrest like 1000 people at the same time, right? Like, yeah, the media is all paying attention. And then all of a sudden, in the middle of this speech, you start cutting into people being arrested, doing perp walks like all the bankers are going, like the whole thing. Does that speak to

Dan  10:25
the hypothetical president in this circumstance and know that they're just a distraction? Oh, absolutely.

Jordan  10:29
That's, that's the whole game. Man. That's the he's given a speech to say that these people are coming for democracy, surprise. They're all in jail right. Now. How about that?

Dan  10:41
Well, as we are that's a speech as we are a few days after this. That none of that didn't that didn't happen. No, unfortunately, your your movie fantasy. But yeah, I'm really, there's a part of me that is quite conflicted about, like, how exciting to think the like, you know, given voice to a lot of this stuff is yeah, like or how meaningful it is? Sure. I would like to believe that like, oh, this, this is indicative of, you know, something broader. But But honestly, there's a there's a, another part of me that is okay. This is this is probably impotent in its direction, direction LIS event? Well,

Jordan  11:26
I mean, you have to ask yourself, I think that no, I think the entire country is asking itself right now. Does anybody even listen to the president anymore? Like all all, real talk? Does anybody care what he says?

Dan  11:41
That might be one of the large effects of Trump?

Jordan  11:44
I think, no, it's like, oh, that a president who fucking cares what the President has to say?

Dan  11:49
I mean, for four years, we had a president who's like, Oh, he's talking shit.

Jordan  11:52
He's just talking shit. Oh, I'm gonna do this thing. No, you're not you're just talking shit on Twitter.

Dan  11:58
Right. And I think that even before Trump, you had presidents who would have sort of empty talk and you know, promises. Syria red lines? Use do a bit of that. Yeah. And then you have a president who's just talking just all the time, it seems tough to like, come back from that to be like, oh, we'll take all this very serious about the

Jordan  12:17
gravitas of the office. And how dare you say look at me and say that I should give a shit about what the President says. I can if I so choose, but How dare you say I should? You know,

Dan  12:28
yeah, it's a tough it's a tough walk from the past of like, my fellow Americans. I come to you today. Yeah. To, like Trump being like, they say I have a small dick. I mean,

Jordan  12:38
imagine, imagine FDR is a fireside speeches if it was just like, oh, yeah, the only thing we have to fear is how tiny Hitler's balls are. You might write Yeah, high fives from everybody.

Dan  12:51
Yeah. Who are just the like the notion of thinking about presidents in history, caring about memes.

Jordan  13:01
Well, I mean, did the equivalent of memes at the time?

Dan  13:06
Did he get mad about me? Oh, totally. If there was a

Jordan  13:09
if there was a nasty little comic strip in a paper, he went apeshit. Maybe

Dan  13:14
that's why Alex likes him. I think so. Anyway, we got an episode to go over of Alex's response to this September 2 20, to 2022. And his reactions about what you'd expect.

Jordan  13:26
It's a great speech. I loved it. I am a huge fan of Biden from now

Dan  13:30
evocative and its imagery.

Jordan  13:34
All those things I said about MMA, I think diseases.

Dan  13:37
Excited to see where this goes. Yeah, Alex loved it. Yeah. We'll get into all that. But before we do, Jordan, let's say hello to somebody walk. Oh, that's great idea. So first illegal Owen Wilson impersonator. Thank you so much. You are now policy walk. I'm a policy.

Alex Jones  14:25

Jordan  14:26
Thank you very much.

Dan  14:27

Alex Jones  14:41
I'm a policy wonk.

Unknown Speaker  14:44
Telling you brilliant

Alex Jones  14:45
someone someone sought him out and sent me a bucket of poop daddy sharp. Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black action. He's a loser, little little teddy baby. I don't want to hate black people. I renounce Jesus Christ. Thank you so much. Thank

Jordan  15:01
you very much.

Dan  15:04
So yeah, the speech happened. Yep. And because of that, Alex decided like, I'm not even gonna wait for my intro to play. I'm just getting in there, right? diving in. Second, the show start.

Jordan  15:16
I'm gonna sink my teeth into this speech.

Dan  15:18
He is like, just in it. Okay.

Alex Jones  15:23
As you can now see America is going under total New World Order martial law. Biden has literally given a speech declaring war on the people in Hitlerian rachet. You want to miss this broadcast? Infowars tomorrow's news today.

Dan  15:41
Timing. Nailed it.

Jordan  15:43
Yeah, that's not bad. It's not bad. That's professional. Sure.

Dan  15:47
The hit Larian set really seems to be one of the primary things that Alex is focused on the optics of it, right, the red light behind him the fact that he gave a speech at night? Sure. These are things that Alex seems almost preoccupied by Eve. Um, I

Jordan  16:07
mean, I assume that the content of the speech is not really something he's very interested in. Well, some

Dan  16:12
of it a little bit here and there. Sure that were some of the stuff that really works well, for him. Sure. Yeah. But the optics are, and I think one of the reasons that this is really sticking in his Craw, as it were, is we heard for years during Trump's time, Alex being like, you have the bully pulpit. Yeah, do an evening speech, get out there and address the population in prime time and get your your message across. Trump didn't wouldn't do that. Right? Or he didn't. He didn't do the thing that Alex wants. And now here you have Biden doing exactly what Alex was wishing Trump would do.

Jordan  16:51
And not just that, but giving a speech to you know, the thing that they are famously furious that he cannot do you know, he can't speak clearly for a second, right? Which kind of thing and

Dan  17:02
you do note that Alex doesn't play like the full speech? Of course not. He plays some bit, and we'll get to that here in a second. But like, yeah, because there is a key he makes gaffes all the time. Doesn't know plan. He's pumping. Oh, man. Yeah. And so yeah, it's I think it's sour grapes. Somewhat for Alex. He wishes that Trump would have done something like this. He wishes that Trump would have declared war on the globalist I mean, yeah, I was gonna say, and he's, he's mad that he's in a situation where like, Biden's doing the thing I wanted Trump to do.

Jordan  17:41
I'm not saying that I have any kinship with Alex over this, but I do believe that his idea of what speeches would happen is very similar to mine. You know, that, you know, the speech happens while you're arresting everybody that you need arrested. Yeah, I think he and I are very similarly allied Well, in that being the way that speeches should go,

Dan  18:04
Well, there's a slight difference, because you well, you guys are both like experiencing reality as a movie. But

Jordan  18:13
I'm wishing reality wasn't moving. Right. That's different. That is the different Alex

Dan  18:17
is portraying Biden giving the speech as cover for as what I think what Yeah, inevitable lock locking up of all of his political issues. Yeah. So I guess yeah, there's, there's a similarity, you should talk to somebody about that, like, see an expert see? What nothing?

Jordan  18:36
What am I supposed to say to that expert?

Dan  18:39
I don't know. There's like 700 episodes, to show that they can check in on

Jordan  18:43
if it's a world that world historian expert. They'll be like, Ooh,

Dan  18:47
yeah, yeah. Maybe Maybe they'll give you an honorary degree. Yes. So Alex does start the show by playing some of Biden speech. And I noticed that there were some cuts that say,

Joe Biden  19:01
not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know. Because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. And here, in my view, is what is true.

Jordan  19:13
Oh, boy.

Dan  19:14
So there's pretty obvious cut there. And one of the things that is very important to point out is that Biden does go out of his way to be very specific about like, what he's talking about. Yeah, he's talking about folks who do not understand the transfer of power. Right, right. The folks who don't have any interest in the sort of governing rules and norms, right. Not just Republicans. This is not just a partisan type speech.

Jordan  19:46
So I assume he broke down at one point and just started screaming January 6, it wasn't that long ago, January.

Dan  19:53
In a fashion Yeah. He does. Bring it up. Okay. So close. So it intrigued me that there was this, these cuts, because he has all the time in the world on his show. Yeah, you can play whatever he wants. Sure. And, you know, you know what he wants to play? Right. So here's what was said in between the clips that was cut out, quote, but there's no question that the Republican party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the mogga Republicans and that this is a threat to this country. These are hard things, but I'm an American president, not the president of red America or blue America but of all America. And I believe it is my duty, my duty to level with you to tell you the truth, no matter how difficult no matter how painful. It may be a coincidence that this was cut out. But it also seems like a point Alex wouldn't be super comfortable with particularly the part about the GOP being intimidated by Trump and his followers. Yeah, the impression about Trump and the Maga folks is supposed to be that they're winning the battle of ideas, and that they're just smarter and more patriotic than the rest of us, which is why they've taken over the GOP, it's not a great idea to plant seeds in the audience's mind that maybe they're a part of something hostile that is gained power not by being ideologically better. But by being more willing to threaten and employ violence. Alex also cuts out the part of the beginning where Biden says, quote, We must never forget, we the people are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago. We the People have a burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall of flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War suffrage, the Great Depression, World Wars, civil rights, that sacred flame still burns now, in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just that is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul. That's just good business on Alex's part, cutting that out. Yeah, he has a vested interest in pretending that his political enemies hate the country and what it stands for. So it's best not to allow someone like Biden to speak like this on Infowars as someone who has a passionate love for the country. Yeah, it would be too confusing to the audience really

Jordan  22:09
terrifying. If he quoted Thomas Jefferson, fuck them up. That would be especially if he did it accurately. Now, if he inaccurately quoted Thomas Jefferson, they would go absolutely apeshit all day, right all day would be a nonstop barrage of this guy doesn't know shit about Thomas Jefferson. Yeah, despite what we all know, to be the truth of their ability to read, remember or even fantasize? Thomas Jefferson quotes?

Dan  22:41
Yeah, if I if any Biden speech writers are listening, oh, slipping something about something and then quote Thomas Jefferson. Yes. All TJ all day that would be, that'd be wonderful. That's the way you gotta go. So I mean, he plays enough of the speech that just play the full passage if you want it. There's just this is Frankenstein together, just cuts everywhere.

Unknown Speaker  23:09
They promote authoritarian leaders. And they fanned the flames of political violence, that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country. We hear you've heard it more and more talk about violence.

Dan  23:30
So you could hear that. Yeah. Here's what Biden said in the middle of that right after where it cut, quote, they look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6, brutally attacking law enforcement not as insurrection is to place the dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots, and they see their Maga failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections. I think Alex knows well enough that most of his audience does see January 6 writers as patriots, which is uncomfortable. Yeah, it's hard for it's hard to rationalize. If you really have to confront it on it. Yeah, yeah. This is holding up a mirror to his audience his beliefs in a way that could be threatening whereas other parts of the speech that are left in they really aren't. For instance, he leaves in Biden saying quote, they promote authoritarian leaders because the audience doesn't think they do that. Trump DeSantis Bolsonaro and or bam, they're the furthest things from authoritarian in the audience's eyes. So hearing Biden say that is just absurd to them. That's not that's not something that's like taken aback by this. Yeah. Another part that Alex leaves in its quote mogga forces are determined to take this country backwards backward to an America where there is no right to choose no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love, all that stuff, the stuff that his audience believes in and is totally fine with.

Jordan  24:59
Yeah. He's gonna say that's like, yeah, man, it's not totally, that's what we are doing. They're

Dan  25:04
anti abortion they lean strongly toward or are outright in favor of banning contraception, they want to get rid of marriage equality. And the idea of right to privacy is vague enough that they can just slip that in a list of the day, I don't

Jordan  25:17
know, we want the right to privacy. But we also want to break into your home if you're gay, so maybe

Dan  25:21
something to do with social media, whatever. This is not threatening for Alex to show the audience because it gives the audience the feeling that Biden is declaring war on them for their political beliefs. They I identify with the people that Biden is describing as a threat to democracy, which is what Alex wants them to feel. And the case of the January 6, thing that's a little bit different. That's a case where the audience will see their feelings mirrored by what Biden is saying, but it's not about political positions, they can justify his rational opposition to abortion, or believing that marriage is just between a man and a woman are things that are common in many religious communities. So it wouldn't give you pause to look at yourself in that mirror. The riots of January 6 were actions and those actions are way harder for people who want to see themselves as respectable to justify that's a mirror it's best not to look into partially because what Biden is saying makes sense. Yeah. The group that tried to overrun the capitol in order to stop the last election for being certified poses a threat to our democratic processes. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, you don't want to look at that mirror. Alex has also cut this part out, quote, but Well, the threat to American democracy is real. I want to say as clearly as we can, we are not powerless in the face of these threats. We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy. There are far more Americans far more Americans from every from every background and belief who reject the extreme mogga ideology than those who accept it. After that line, there was a big cheer, this could be useful to instill fear in the audience. But that doesn't play as well with the Infowars version of Biden and these ideas. Yeah, a huge part of the election conspiracy is that Biden was so unpopular, and then no one would come to his rallies. So you don't really want these large applause breaks. And the getting applause for the idea that there are more people who share sick of this stuff, share, share share, than Alex's goofy audience not good. That's not good. Now, there's a bunch more that's cut out and a lot of it is Biden saying things about uniting around defending our political process, and then getting applause, right? No need for stuff like that. Because it's bad optics. Hey, you don't want it?

Jordan  27:31
I mean, yeah, also for him. It's like, yeah, you know, it's not even a thing. It's just like, oh, yeah, we're not you. We don't We can't use that. So why leave it in you know, and nobody's going to question as for cutting it, it's obvious.

Dan  27:44
My audience is gonna watch the whole day don't give a shit, please. Yeah. They're gonna accept whatever interpretation I give, and that's going to be reality.

Jordan  27:53
You know, I was I was wondering, I, you know, part of why I think that calling the January 6 People patriots is weird to me is because it was such a huge fuckup you know, like, it'd been a really we all saw that it was just a bunch of fucking assholes, just really being pieces of shit, you know? And it's like, you can't mythologize that the same way you can the Boston Tea Party, you know, like, that was just a bunch of assholes going on a boat and like fucking shit up, you know,

Dan  28:25
counterpoint what? William Travis?

Jordan  28:29
That's true. Fair enough. Yeah, fair enough. You can build an entire American legend on an drunk asshole. Fucking murdering people at their

Dan  28:37
house was only there because he was running away from his ex wife. Yeah,

Jordan  28:42
Nevermind. Nevermind, he in my bed. I should have looked at Mormonism.

Dan  28:48
There's, there's a we're too close to it now. Yeah. You still remember some of the details as opposed to the right selling of the myth? Exactly. So I think I think you're right for now. But give it a little.

Jordan  29:01
Sure. No, no, they're they're the true American revolutionaries in 10 years. I get it. Yeah.

Dan  29:06
So there's one one more bit that was I noticed a just a massive cut here.

Unknown Speaker  29:13
There are public figures today, yesterday and the day before predicting, and all the calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets. This is inflammatory, is dangerous. It's against the rule of law. And we the people must say, This is not who we are. And now, America

Dan  29:40
has a big cut. Jaren. So here's what I was missing their quote. Look, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give and take of politics and disagreement and debate and dissent. We're a big complicated country, but democracy endures only if we the people respect the guardrails. of the Republic. Only if we the people accept the results of free and fair elections, only if we the people see politics not as total war but mediation of our differences. democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election. Either they win or they were cheated. That's where mogga Republicans are today. Fair point. Yeah. Can't argue with that. Yeah. It every single fucking election. It's getting to the point where, you know, obviously, that should give some of the folks pause. Yeah, on the maybe some of the more aware, self aware listeners to Alex's church, it'd be like, All right. Sarah Palin lost those cheating Laura Loomer loss.

Jordan  30:48
I mean, all the cheating man, but

Dan  30:50
what if they can?

Jordan  30:52
I mean, who has the time to cheat that many elections? Well, even the globalists are stretched thin man, they don't have time for Alaskan elections. Sarah Palin can lose on her own baby.

Dan  31:04
And with the case of Laura Loomer, it's gotta like, you gotta look at this half glass is half full. Yeah.

Jordan  31:12
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. You

Dan  31:14
lost but damn. Upset it.

Jordan  31:17
I mean, yeah, you lost but you were a de W away from getting a W you know what I'm saying? Like that was a very short, short walk. Yeah.

Dan  31:27
Also, in this portion, Biden lists off a number of his accomplishments that that he's helped make possible in the past two years, all of which are things that Alex is pretending aren't real. So it's best not to confuse the audience with Yeah, definitely don't do that. This also also cut out the part where there's a protester yelling stuff to disrupt the speech. And Biden says, quote, notwithstanding those folks, you hear on the other side there, they're entitled to be outrageous. This is a democracy, but history and common sense, good manners is nothing they've suffered from. That's a pretty far cry from all those times Trump interrupted his own speeches to demand protesters be kicked out or times he responded with GLEDE protesters being assaulted at his rallies. Yeah, that one was tough. It's kind of hard to paint the patience that Biden is exhibiting and tolerance of somebody who disagrees as tyrannical, right? Especially juxtaposed with right, kick that bomb out, I

Jordan  32:25
know, you really have to cut out a lot of Biden speech in order to make him look like a tyrant. Yeah,

Dan  32:31
I mean, but there's red lights, and he's doing this at night. So that's pretty good.

Jordan  32:36
I mean, the funniest part about it is like, you know, I suppose you could go with the bailout and like the ACA to portray Obama as a tyrant, you know, at least there's that. But with Biden, it really does feel like he's half assing ever, you know, like, is he a tyrant? If he's willing to be like a 10k? In student loan? Forgiveness? I'm not gonna go after these hard right people and say, We got to get 20 from this. And Jack, this is negotiation. All right. You can't retire can't be a tyrant if you're literally low balling your own power.

Dan  33:15
Sure, I think it's tough, but it's a challenge that wants to step it up to the plate. Yeah. Another thing that's weird here is that the part where this picks up after the cut, where Biden says, quote, and now America must choose. That's actually from earlier in the speech. This is edited out of order to create the impression that Alex is wanting to convey, right, I promise I could make Alex's show look so much worse, if I just gave up on the idea of linear time. That's not fair. Because this is the very definition of taking things out of context. Yeah. Out of context. In temporal space. Yeah,

Jordan  33:53
no, if you take it out of one time, and then put it into a different time,

Dan  33:57
and make it appear that thoughts are flowing into each other that aren't you might as well

Jordan  34:01
edit in each individual word to make him say, I am not a tyrant.

Dan  34:05
Yeah, might as well be a magazine cut out of absolutely. Hostage letter. Yep. I understand that. Maybe for time reasons. Alex wouldn't want to play the whole speech. But the way this is being presented is irresponsible. And it's intentionally deceptive. Yeah. 100 shouldn't expect anything otherwise. Yeah. So this clip comes to an end or the part of the speech. And Alex has some words and this is it. Like this is the entire show.

Unknown Speaker  34:33
We can choose a better path forward to the future. A future a possibility, a future to build a dream and oh, and we're on that path moving ahead.

Alex Jones  34:46
Everything he said is an inversion of the truth. There we go, aren't you he'd give a speech declaring war in America. They are locked and loaded to stage massive terror attacks. This country is on the footsteps of doom and everybody better get the word out that they're planning stage violence. They're the ones preparing violence. They have the history of provocative tearing, and you heard him with no proof. Say that Republicans are calling for violence. They had a bunch of national TV shows. Last two days say I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite. These people are making their move on us. Oh, my God with a fascist background. All they mess was the torches.

Jordan  35:23
I don't know. I torches isn't that traditionally, pitchforks and torches coming from the other direction?

Dan  35:29
Yeah. And I think that the torches, certainly in present parlance evokes ideas of the unite the right rally. Yeah, to the tiki torches, right, which is his friend, which would be the buddies that he's around. Yeah. I don't know. I don't understand exactly. I'm sure there's some image he's trying to evoke. That's not that. But I strongly suspect that Alex has the tone that he has there. Because he knows that his followers are primed to hear something like this as the go ahead to start shooting or carrying out violence against the government. He desperately needs to create the preemptive narrative that anything that may happen is not real, and will be a false flag completely fake. Incidentally, when Biden said the public figures were calling for violence and when people were talking about that they weren't talking about Alex. This was almost certainly in response to Senator Lindsey Graham going on Fox News and saying that if Trump was charged for having all that classified Shadid Mar a Lago, then there would be riots in the streets. Nothing is not always about Alex. No, everything is always I mean, you except for to him, you could argue that most things are not about Alex typically, especially when Alec says they're about him. Yeah, that's a dead giveaway that they're probably not.

Jordan  36:39
I do appreciate the discourse in America. You know, like, you think back to those those conservative commentators like William F. Buckley, Jr. And you think about him now saying, you know, what amounts to I'm rubber and you're glue Neener Neener? What bounces off? Me? 60? You? Yeah, is is essentially just I mean, I think when I think it's evolution, sure, you know,

Dan  37:02
ask not what the government can do for you and what you can do for the government. Now, this is an inversion ever.

Jordan  37:10
Asked, not what the government can do for you. Because the government can do everything but not for you. For you. They must do nothing. He's not

Dan  37:18
even a burly. Boy, so yeah, I think that that, obviously, he knows that they're about to go to break chain. So he has a limited amount of time. But the argument of the reverse of everything

Jordan  37:35
he said is not true. What I say is true. Is a little lace

Dan  37:37
viously. A little bit lazy. Yeah. So look, I'm telling you, the entire show is just false flags are coming. Sure this is this? Because that's the only thing that's important. Yeah. Alex knows well enough. He's plugged into No. Like he's friends with all kinds of Oathkeeper types. Yep. Who have been begging to fight a fucking war forever. Like he knows enough to see the optics of this to see the way people are talking about it. And know, someone is probably making a bomb as we speak. Yeah. So when that happens, if that happens, right? I don't want to be blamed for it. And I don't want this to be a setback to my business. And to my ideology. Yeah. So it has to be fake in advance. Yeah. And when he was talking about false flags coming before this speech, I mean, it's the same thing. It's just much more important now. When when there was those, you know, we touched on this before, but like, you know, the clips on on social media going around of him saying false flags come before the midterms, check. That's just his normal every day. Type. Press. Right? Yeah, this is far more pitched. Yeah. And I know that the reason is, because he knows there's a heightened chance, right, his friends are going to do some real fucked up stuff.

Jordan  39:03
Yeah, that's true. I don't know. I think I would take that bet. I think I would take the bet. Because the bet is, if you arrest Trump, and you do the law thing correctly, there's there's they they attack, or nothing happens and we get Trump. You know, I think I take the bet. I think if we get Trump and they don't attack, the wind drops out of their sails completely. Like if they actually

Dan  39:32
I don't even don't I don't even think it's healthy to look at it this way. Yeah. Because I think that the legal system or whatever, should play out how it plays out. And if there is cause and it's, you know, appropriate to arrest him, fucking arrest him. There should not be a consideration of what the backlash will be. Because that's terrorist

Jordan  39:55
right. I understand that. I understand that you know, but you understand that is the case. The iteration that is being taken place.

Dan  40:02
I understand well, at least there's certainly that's a big part of the conversation. Hopefully not within law enforcement. Yeah, of

Jordan  40:08
course it is. Well, why didn't Why do you think Muller didn't charge him in the first place at the DOJ?

Dan  40:14
Maybe it's not appropriate for a sitting President to be charged. I don't know. Look, there's the fair enough shit. There's also maybe other considerations. Yeah. But the the Yeah, I get I get where you're coming from. But also, I think that's naive, because I think that to assume an immediate backlash is the backlash Sure. Might be might be short sighted. So like, if you know, Trump were arrested and nothing happens. It doesn't mean like six months of planning later or something wouldn't

Jordan  40:45
Sure sure. That's possible and elaborate

Dan  40:46
jailbreak. Right? You do understand what really Trump out of his resort prison again,

Jordan  40:53
we're talking about an escape plan planned by the dumbest people on the fucking planet. You know, like, I'm not afraid of their plans. I'm afraid of a flashmob. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I feel like their plans will be foiled very, very easily. Right. Yeah.

Dan  41:09
Right. Yeah. i It's, it's It's tough. It's a tough thing to think about. But I hope that decision making isn't being guided by the potential for people to cause rampant and random political damage. Yeah. Because that again, is terrorism. Yeah. It's not a great way to guide decision making. Right, right. Right. And I understand where we are. And that's why Biden gave the fucking speech. Exactly. There you go.

Dan  41:43
So this got me really excited. But don't worry, it's a deflation.

Alex Jones  41:47
This is an emergency broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll be up here tomorrow, taping another emergency three hour broadcast with some special guests. Who are going to be here today, but with the storms across the country. Their plane is delayed until this evening. I'll leave it at that special guest studio. Tomorrow. We've got big guest as well in studio today. A psychological warfare expert are leading ones in the world. At the bottom of the hour,

Jordan  42:15
oh, now you can't tell me that it's gonna be a deflation.

Dan  42:20
Well, I wanted you to feel how I felt. I know. But come on. So good. I thought it was gonna be pedantic. I thought he was gonna be making his return. Time. Now's the time. Yeah, so somebody's plane was not able to get to Texas. For

Jordan  42:38
whatever reason, I'll just leave it at that. Alex

Dan  42:40
didn't record three hours. did not happen. Or at least it's not up on banned dot video or any anywhere I can find of the normal places things are posted. Right. So I don't think this happened. But I was thinking about it. Like, it's probably just Roger, right? Yeah, he lives in Florida.

Jordan  42:56
Yeah, that would be the sense. And if it is Roger, then of course, you'd have to say something along. I'll just leave it at that. Right. You can't be like, Oh, I mean, there was a weather event. Yeah,

Dan  43:08
I don't I don't I didn't check the weather reports to see where there were delays. Yeah. But yeah, I'm trying to think who could possibly even be in that Rolodex. Joel Skousen is not coming in. No. Type with you at best. Oh, man. Barnes just I think is in Texas. Now. What

Jordan  43:29
if he got banned? And what if he got the band's ban and

Dan  43:32
would come remote?

Jordan  43:35
That is true. Yeah. Maybe he's got a family vacation plan.

Dan  43:38
He's in a bunker, the War Room bunker? Sure. But Alex is not mad about now. No, no stealing the name of Oh, lucky.

Jordan  43:45
That's no big deal.

Dan  43:47
Yep. I don't know Trump. Could be

Jordan  43:52
he's got to get out of the state. extradition from Texas is tougher than you might think.

Dan  43:57
So Alex has some analysis and it's really superficial.

Alex Jones  44:03
Ladies and gentlemen. This is like if you go to the zoo, and take your three year old you go that's an elephant honey chair, and it's an elephant. There's no debating it's an elephant, or that's a tiger or that's a giraffe or that's a grizzly bear, or that's a penguin or that's a boa constrictor. When the leader of a country gets up and declares half the nation terrorist and says they're about to engage in terrorism, and they do it with troops behind them with a red background, with a with a dark cross above it. There is a dark cross in every Hollywood movie, and every dystopian system. They show that exact iconography, all of its scripted by design in V for Vendetta. It's the exact set.

Dan  44:50
Also, incidentally, filming that three hours special so honey, can't take you to the zoo. I know I plan to take my daughter Did the zoo

Jordan  45:00
listen we were gonna go fishing but that fell through. So we were like, Let's go to the zoo and

Dan  45:05
now that's why Sorry,

Jordan  45:07
sorry plane got delayed.

Dan  45:10
Everything is movies. Yeah, everything is based on the surface level and appearances and it's kind of troubling. It's really doesn't mean much more than him saying that he looked at the speech and it reminded him of movies. Yeah. Also Biden didn't say that shit. No, that's just a mischaracterization of his work.

Jordan  45:28
It would be interesting if he threw that one out there though. Hey, listen. Listen, vessels 50% of this country is coming to kill you. If the President said that. That would be a statement of war. Listen up. Listen up. So

Dan  45:43
listen, Jack 80% of

Jordan  45:45
Straight Talk Express covenants. 50% of American has got a gun it's covered for you.

Dan  45:52
50% of America are bad boys and they run with a team of Bad Boys All right, okay. Yeah, it's it would have been I think I think our conversation about it would probably be different if that was what he said. Yeah. It'd be very interesting. That's it on undiplomatic. Unproductive way to

Jordan  46:13
The Last Jedi background looking at looking at a rave right now those people Yeah, I get it. I get it. That would be evil.

Dan  46:22
I honestly would even have a pretty different take on it. If it was what you fantasize.

Jordan  46:27
I would have a different take on it if they pulled that one off. Yeah. Yeah. It's very cute.

Dan  46:31
Ish. Yeah. So Alex's, he's talking about this on he's like, Man, this seems like I can work with this guy. I'm gonna I'm gonna create some brand big.

Alex Jones  46:43
Ladies and gentlemen, when they project big blood red lights on a wall. With flags and troops at the ready. They're saying we're coming for you and what it is. I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name. Oh, gotta have a dance. I bet it's called Operation, Matador. I bet bullfight. They see us as the bowl. And they are shaking a red flag in our face. And the matador has a deep state with a long, skinny razor sharp sword. Show that when the bowl I'm just forward it's called a matador uses the force of its weight could drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust. This is operation Matador. This operation Matador T shirts coming soon.

Jordan  47:46
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don't get to do all your operation names have been documents in the past. You've been like we got operation lockstep, and there was not really at least there was a thing though, at least there was a word lockstep that could be

Dan  48:01
found somewhere another doc Exactly. Matadors exist.

Jordan  48:06
But you can't pitch your own name they give you you can't just be like I bet it's called and then and then just give it a name. And then call it the name they gave it

Dan  48:17
but he had a second option which is bullfight and Matadors Matadors work the process he did work on man, come on Jack,

Jordan  48:27
and then there's and then he has his own fucking analogy in order to explain the name that he bets they made up for it, thinking that they had the metaphorical will wherewithal to make that up there.

Dan  48:41
It's a pain it's not good, but Alex likes it though. So

Jordan  48:45
he's gonna keep going. He's gonna keep going with Operation Matador Yeah, all right. It's

Dan  48:49
fun though. The idea that he's just sitting there as like, I bet there's a fucking name for this and I'm gonna spit ball

Jordan  48:56
myself operation Listen up, Jack. Yeah.

Dan  49:00
So we goes along with this bull analogy. Sure

Alex Jones  49:02
show that's all this shit and the firt and the way you get a bull that outweighs the matador 15 times as big giant razor sharp horns finally run into the sword is they throw little Spears I think sharp into his back sharp to pitch him off and to anger him that's what they've been doing with the open borders the drag queen storytime the value dollars and shutting off your power supplies and remote controlling all the devices in your house. We weren't you 20 years ago they would do? Sure. And running down America and running down our families and having the NFL take a knee and all the rest of this garbage.

Jordan  49:41
I'm sorry what?

Alex Jones  49:44
That was throwing a little spears, the barbs in our back. But now the red capes out with 67 days out from the midterms where they know they're set to lose big despite all the dead people that got on the rolls, hoping they can steal it with mail in ballots and So now the red tape is out being slapped in our face. And right behind it is the FBI and the New World Order getting ready to stage terror attacks Jesus they know we're not gonna jump on the sword populace Christians conservatives are too smart

Dan  50:15
operation Matador what is happening

Jordan  50:18
so

Dan  50:19
if you follow this and understand him for his language, then you know that most of the stuff Alex talks about his bullshit and a lot of these things he's listed as spears being poked to anger the audience or just buzzwords he throws around to prompt an emotional reaction from the audience. This list is an airing of grievances and the complaint is basically that Alex doesn't like technological advancement and abhors a society that embraces immigrants and LGBTQ community, folks, right. He yells about free speech all day but wants to live in a country where athletes aren't allowed to take a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial discrimination in policing. These are things that Alex conceptualizes as the spear is being used to poke the metaphorical bowl and it really just sounds to me like Alex is expressing a profoundly white identity view of the country. He doesn't believe that people who are not straight white Christians are entitled to rights or power in this country. And on some level anytime he hears a conversation about people who fit this description acting in a way that he doesn't like, his reaction is basically like you should be glad us white folks even let you be here.

Jordan  51:22
Yeah, I mean, it does seem like the more apt metaphorical stand in for Alex in this scenario is in fact, the bowl itself, constantly being enraged by any number of different things for

Dan  51:38
Alex is the spirit. Yeah, he's angry. Anyway, each time he sees these things, these things like people living, he experiences that as spear being poked into his white Christian tolerance. Colin Kaepernick taking a knee instead of just accepting police violence. That's a spear drag queens reading at a library instead of being shamed into never living in public. That's a spear immigrants being allowed into the country. Instead of having a hardened militarized border. They're killed for crossing that's a spear. Here's the thing. When a bowl charges after being poked by a bunch of spears, it's a natural reaction. The matador waving that flag is something of the bowl can't really be faulted for charging. It's the expected result of all the poking. If we understand Alex's metaphor, his Patriot buddies are the bowl and there they would be well within their right to charge the matador in this case bomb things because they've been poked so much, right. The only problem is that the matadors Cape has the FBI behind it. That doesn't really make sense, because in the metaphorical Matador situation, there's a whole thing. There's really no way to make it a false flag. You would need like a fake bowl or some shit. And I have no idea how this works inside this construction. Yeah, this isn't Alex warning about a false flag. This is him warning his buddies about following their instincts. He's trying to tell the bull not to charge because it's a trap. Because Alex understand that his buddies want to charge that Matador really badly. They want to bomb shit. And Alex is smart enough to recognize that the way that people are talking about Biden speech is exactly the kind of thing that will lead. That will be as much of a stimulus for that as a matador waving okay, this isn't a false flag situation he's talking about. It's more of a honeypot kind of idea.

Jordan  53:25
I mean, yeah, I was I was comparing them to the bull boar in the sense that they lose at the end. The bull doesn't win. True, like and the bowl can't like, overcome the whole thing and be like, Hey, listen, I've chosen the way of peace. Like the bowl is going to do the thing because they have no ability to stop themselves a

Dan  53:51
bowl could like I think a better way to make this metaphor work, I guess is the bowl is the audience. Alex's the spears poking them. Yeah. And then getting arrested is the matador. Yeah,

Jordan  54:04
yeah, that works. Yeah, that's something along

Dan  54:08
the line. And Alexander will deny that he was ever a spear or anything. Right. Right. Right. Nothing to do with this. Right? Yeah, there's the incitement that is being done by Alex. Yeah. And then yeah, there's no false flag or trickery, really.

Jordan  54:22
And even then Alex could be the matador trying to navigate the bowl, but really not having any control over where the bowl goes. And so the bowl constantly comes at him and then you know, runs forward and there's all kinds of collateral damage.

Dan  54:39
I think the point though, is that this metaphor isn't good. No, that is the point. And Alex is talking about this being like staged false flag terror attacks that they're going to globalists are going to do and shit. Yeah, it just doesn't work within this, like the framework that he's talking about. Yeah, the only way for the bowl metaphor to work is I Alec's understanding that his audience is going to carry out bombing, right? It's just that they're being provoked into doing it, right, because they think that it's the right thing to do.

Jordan  55:11
I would also accept that it might work if at an actual bullfight when the matador pulled the cape aside, the FBI was there.

Dan  55:19
That's still not a false flag. Nobody would make more sense. But I think that maybe Alex is thinking of the cape as a flag, right? Maybe. I don't I don't know. Trying to come up with the way this works.

Jordan  55:31
We're working on it. We'll figure it out someday.

Dan  55:34
So look, I don't have that many clips from this whole episode. And one of the reasons is because it's incessant false flag talk. That's really the 80% of the content. Okay.

Alex Jones  55:46
Why do you make an announcement this bold and crazy? Because they're gonna pull stuff so damn horrible. And they're going to go ahead and make their move on everybody. They'll assassinate Trump. They'll, they'll come kill me.

Jordan  56:05
Sure. Naturally,

Alex Jones  56:07
they're gonna come for you. They're making their move. And they're insane. I will be dead by the midterms.

Jordan  56:17
I mean, but But what are you talking about? Then? You're then say you call for violence. You're saying he's saying that they're calling. They're literally coming to kill you. And there's no stopping it? Because he just announced it. Yeah. So if he is announced that the war has started, then the war has started.

Dan  56:36
Ah, but the war is a trick. What's I don't

Jordan  56:40
know. You can't you can't stage false flags. If the war has already started. Do you understand? There's no reason to have false flags?

Dan  56:49
Oh, there is. Because you want to look like you're only fighting defensively? It's the same thing that Alex wants.

Jordan  56:56
I mean, no, Alex did the thing for Russia. You can just do the thing. And then you'll have people lie for you.

Dan  57:02
DREW? I mean, that's an option. Yeah. I look. Oh, there's holes.

Jordan  57:10
Yes, there's my bed. Sorry.

Dan  57:13
I know that. Part of the fun banter here is not putting missing your ideas. Adopting Alex's ability to patch over things. Yeah, there's too many holes here for balcan to really do work on this. That's too hard. But Alex has told me hurts.

Alex Jones  57:33
So I told you the last month, my gut level, also intellectual analysis is 10 times worse than it's ever been. I mean, 10 times more intense. 10 times more concerned. I'm guaranteeing you Okay. Garin teeing you that unless we see massive Justice Department whistleblowers now, and unless we see people, even in corporate media that know they're mercenaries and know what they're doing is wrong. And a lot of them do. Unless we just see everybody start coming out and saying, I'm not with this. It's over. And again, we'll say, well, we'll just have a war with these people. And we'll show them that's the plan. We don't want to have a war with these psychos will beat them. But in the process, it'll be a Pyrrhic victory. No,

Dan  58:19
you'll lose. Yeah. That's why you don't you don't want really bad. Yeah,

Jordan  58:23
yeah. Yeah. Yeah, nobody's actually gonna fight a civil war. No, it would be absurd. No, I mean, frankly, it just be expensive.

Dan  58:33
And there will be more and greater right wing terrorism. Yeah. And that will be, you know, yeah. What happened? Yeah, that really, because as much as you know, some of that is galvanizing for his community, you know, denying Oklahoma City bombing is certainly something that they've made a lot of mileage on. Yeah, it's also a lot of work. It's a hassle. And you'd rather not do that other play in this, this space, this, this shroud and jurors bombing space that Alex is in now is much easier to to live in. Well, and

Jordan  59:09
I mean, not just that, but if you're going to have a Civil War II, then you have to have a concept of your end game. And if you're the terrorists side, then ostensibly your endgame is defensive. Maintaining your territory, what is your territory? Texas? I mean, that's what I'm saying. So if you win the Civil War, do you get all of America or do you get a certain subsection of America and you don't want a subsection of America? It'd be all right. And you'd be but who's how would you get all they can't do it? There's no infrastructure that they can handle. No, there's no way to get water there when when the Civil War they're like, oh, it's all the wild west. They can't govern.

Dan  59:54
True. You know, like, Alex believes that Trump is the rightful president. The US sure he thinks the Confederacy is the rightful heir is that government?

Jordan  1:00:06
There actually the south didn't just not lose the Civil War. They want it all the way. Right. Yeah. So

Dan  1:00:11
he just wants to get back to that. Right. Right. That's that's kind of how you should conceive of

Jordan  1:00:15
that's fair. That's fair. It's

Dan  1:00:17
on me. Yeah. So yeah, look, they who?

Alex Jones  1:00:21
I'll guarantee you, they got trucks loaded with fuel oil bombs right now. I guarantee they're gonna run the same plays again. They did 95. But if we put enough heat on them, and if enough of their minions are trying to shut up as the patsies learn about this, it'll neutralize them.

Dan  1:00:42
Yeah. So we got bombs and trucks cheer, ready to go right. Today? This is extreme. Yeah. But if I believed any of this, I'd be pretty scared.

Jordan  1:00:51
Yeah. Yeah, this would be a real struggle to get around.

Dan  1:00:55
Sure. And, I mean, if you believe all of this, like OKC was a false flag, they have fuel bomb trucks ready to go. You kind of have to think that the target would be a civilian target. Yeah. If you're somebody who just lives and like, listens to Alex believes this stuff goes about your day. I don't know how you could not think like, well, maybe the building that I work in, could be a target or like it's, it's gonna be cripplingly scary, whether it's a conscious fear or not, like, there's got to be something that it's, it's awful.

Jordan  1:01:32
And if he's evoking OKC it's not like, it's not like, oh, this only happens in the major cities. That's like that is I mean, it's not not a city, but it is like, that is more of the well, it could happen in my suburb. Yeah.

Dan  1:01:46
It's a mid range American city. Yeah. Not not a metropolis, right. Yeah, yep. And I think that's the feeling that he wants his audience to have. Yep. So Alex has some experts that he's talked to. They have dudes, I gotta say who, but they fucking agree with him.

Alex Jones  1:02:05
In the last few days, I've talked to high level current Pentagon, and high level current CIA and high level Army Special Operations Command, and they concur with my analysis. 100% say it's their analysis, and that America has never been in more trouble. But obviously, those people can't come on the show. Obviously, I can tell you that people that have done this in third world countries, and people that have run regime change agree, there's an attempt by the leftist arm of the deep state to stage advance and permanently bring America into martial law.

Dan  1:02:34
That's fucking Steve. Yeah, that is

Jordan  1:02:37
Steve. That is 100% of Steve. Oh, yeah.

Dan  1:02:40
Guys who have run regime change. These are epithets that Alex uses to describe Steve Janek Janek alone. And he's so I bet he's talking to Steve. You're not saying the words though. He's backsliding into this abusive relationship. Yeah, no, you're gonna have a matter of time. It is. Oh, God. Yes. can't quit just rip the band aid off and get him back already high. No. Now. I do think that it would make sense that these high level people agree with Alex because we heard not too long ago that Alex is the fucking leader of the government. Yeah, but

Jordan  1:03:17
he doesn't even remember that. He does not remember that. He is not calling people

Dan  1:03:22
are gonna tell I brought it up. You forgot I completely forgot.

Jordan  1:03:25
Is it day to day? It's a day to day show continuity?

Dan  1:03:29
No, not at all. Alex is in charge of the Patriots in the government. Yeah. Like they look to Him as leader. Of course, their analysis intersects

Jordan  1:03:40
What are they doing with analysis? Shouldn't they know shit?

Dan  1:03:43
There, but that's what analysis is. It's their know. That's the things they know from the things they know.

Jordan  1:03:50
Yeah. But shouldn't he be calling them to confirm his analysis and not have them be like, we were thinking the same thing, bro. We don't have any explanation or why

Dan  1:03:59
let me explain this. He's just talking shit with people who don't actually have any information. Well, there's that and they're not like high level that he's talking shit with Steve. Yeah, basically fun.

Jordan  1:04:11
It's more fun. Yeah, yeah.

Dan  1:04:13
Speaking of not fun. This clip was really where I, if I were involved in towel throwing sure this is maybe where I would throw the towel on this. I kind of brought me back to reality.

Alex Jones  1:04:27
They know they've lost politically they know they're about to lose the election show they are getting ready to stage something huge ladies and gentlemen. So the public would least buy that Oh, because of the big terror attack or whatever, or terror attacks or mass shootings or mass poisonings or power outages or whatever it is, they're gearing up to do. There's a plethora of things they can do within the false flag realm. And so I'm just going to be every day on this until the election because they'll want a few weeks to maximize it. I'd say we enter the primes zone October 1, and October after they may go ahead just start stuff up now and then they may do a bunch of attacks. They may do one big giant attack they may do five six big attacks is that all? The truck bombs are loaded. Okay, you better believe the mentally ill schizophrenic mass shooters are being programmed and drugged up and are in government see CIA New World Order programming centers, impaled for operations right now. The Manchurian candidates are ready, they are rolling out, guaranteed, you can bet your bottom dollar.

Dan  1:05:34
So I've been kind of zoning out a little bit. Yeah, at this point, because it's just repetitive yelling nonsense about false flags. But I kind of got brought back down to the ground by this clip. And it was just like, what, just what are we doing? Like Alex's conspiracy and this grand false flag that's coming and Biden speech is the harbinger for it. It all centers around the fucking midterms. I mean, the plot for this giant false flag is by creating the public perception that it makes sense for Democrats to win midterm elections. What is going on? Is this what Alex has been brought to? And it's

Jordan  1:06:09
not just that but he's listing everything is a sign. Like every you know, it's not just false flags, where it's like, oh, there's an explosion or something? No, it's like, hey, the power went out for eight hours. Right? They're coming for you. Right? You know, like, oh, shit, the Wi Fi

Dan  1:06:25
is down. Anything could be explained as the jump or anything.

Jordan  1:06:29
Yeah. And he's listing random as shit. You know, like, and it's the anybody anything, any any

Dan  1:06:37
sunrises and the rooster is silent.

Jordan  1:06:41
If someone looks shifty at you in the grocery store, that's the side right? You know, like there's no escape.

Dan  1:06:47
Yes, if you see a rainbow and the colors are inverted,

Jordan  1:06:51
Baro it's gonna be fine. I can't hang with that.

Dan  1:06:56
Oh, they've been beaten back. We realize the car bombs. What are you doing to me? Yeah, it's it's insane. And the notion that it's about the midterms is just pathetic. I can't hates I, I can't. I there was there was at least a self seriousness that Alex had in earlier times in his career. Where that would this would look embarrassing for him to be like going so far out of his way to create these elaborate conspiracy theories about something like a midterm election. I mean, yeah, it's it. How how obsessed is he with like, treating, like politics, like sports, and like a pop culture kind of thing. That he's doing this about a midterm. Yeah. It's so sad.

Jordan  1:07:49
Yeah, man. He's supposed to be above this used to do 911 Dude. And now you're at the midterm.

Dan  1:07:55
Well, he's trying to pretend that 911 is coming in order for Democrats to win a midterm.

Jordan  1:07:59
Really? I mean, that's so sad. Yeah.

Dan  1:08:02
That's

Jordan  1:08:04
a it's the most important election of our lifetimes, Dan.

Dan  1:08:07
I mean, I think that a lot of people very rightly critique that kind of rhetoric all over the place. And I think that's fine. I think that Alex is doing a substantially worse version of it. More extreme version.

Alex Jones  1:08:21
Yep. What a bummer. Yeah.

Dan  1:08:22
So Alex, take some calls. And he wants to talk to people who are like, you know, in the military,

Jordan  1:08:29
you're gonna bomb something. It cuz it should be a false flag. He does something.

Dan  1:08:33
He doesn't grill up people about that. Do you think I would if I took over Infowars for a day, I would be like, Okay,

Jordan  1:08:40
I'm taking calls my first question to everyone have you or are you about to build a bomb? Well,

Dan  1:08:46
I think that in the past, I have heard people say like, Alex, I want to talk to you off air. Yeah, I think some of those people might say that. But not on the radio. But he says he wants to take calls from military folk who know things, for sure. And I would suggest that this is a bad strategy because it incentivizes people to lie about being in the military. Because if I'm only taking calls from military people, like oh, hey, guess what? Now I'm military.

Jordan  1:09:12
Yeah, yeah. I don't know if you recall that story of the Bundys. And all those dudes sitting around talking about their fucking military experience. Yeah, all their wartime shit. None of them had ever been in the army at all.

Dan  1:09:26
Yeah. Dave Anthony brought that up on. Oh, yeah. For Yeah. But yeah, so Alex takes a call from somebody who is allegedly maybe national security or maybe ice. There could be anybody. His resume is dubious. And he has some news about a bomb.

Alex Jones  1:09:44
Tony is a 15 year Homeland Security. And he wants to get Mrs. view on this from Washington DC. Go ahead, Tony.

Caller Tony (721)  1:09:52
Hey, how you doing? I said God bless you once again. But hey, I'm calling because I'm a 15 year former federal employee for cross border protection work for ice. But I'm come On regard to the whole entire thing about everything is coming about, as you know, six months ago, I was with the federal government, they wanted us to do the vaccine mandates and I told Secretary Mort my arm my orcas send an email, there's about nine to 12% of us who walk away but there will be there will be something coming every couple of months in which I got numerous members when I still work there. And more likely, it's going to be a nuclear bomb minus the plutonium or uranium that's combined, and that's gonna be one of the new set of lockdown so

Jordan  1:10:27
not a nuclear bomb and all federal

Alex Jones  1:10:29
I agree. Suitcase nukes power outage but without the tax they bomb on the Russians. I believe all that's in the cards, but that's what you guys are getting briefed on.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:39
It's one of the things we're getting briefed on but but minus the radiation direction won't be no radiation that's going to be set off, it's all going to be in it's gonna be one where one of the way that they did with the vaccine, one of the way they fear people, some people are gonna be also Brady's

Alex Jones  1:10:50
gonna say nuclear, but it's really classic explosive or you shine. It's gonna be a neutron bomb.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
We got supplies. The last two years, they've been planning this stuff for the last two years. We got, as you know about the body bags. I mean, myself, my former office, we had over 200,000 body bags all over the entire spot.

Alex Jones  1:11:08
They're saying it's a nuclear bomb minus radiation. That's a neutron bomb, which is Kissinger and Virginia. We are obsessed with neutron bombs and he populate America.

Dan  1:11:16
This guy sounds a little speedy.

Jordan  1:11:18
I mean, he's more chatty than any CBP officer I've ever

Dan  1:11:24
met anymore, because he's not part of it. Because he left over vaccine mandate. Yeah,

Jordan  1:11:28
six months ago. Sure, vaccine mandates six months.

Dan  1:11:32
Also, a neutron bomb is not just a nuke minus the radiation. There's still tons of radiation, but the concept is to, like minimize the longevity that the radiation is. So the affected areas inhabited more quickly. Yeah, and we get people back in. But I guess that we should be on the lookout for nuclear bombs that have no radiation involved because this high level ice insider has warned of it. And Alex has agreed this is a serious concern. So yeah, we should probably be really worried about this. This is this is definitely worth your mind space.

Jordan  1:12:05
Yeah, a guy dubiously associated with federal government programs. Ostensibly not on speed right now telling me that nuclear bombs without plutonium are going to hit people. I'm gonna go with a pass on this one though. You

Dan  1:12:22
pass a pass because Alex and I agree. I'm gonna pass

Jordan  1:12:25
Yeah, I'm gonna go in the past on this one. So we finally Shark Tank. Alex is the one going with this business.

Dan  1:12:32
We found the difference between you and Alex. Yeah. So we get another caller. He's got an idea.

Caller 2 (721)  1:12:37
Great to talk to you. My personal opinion is that they're bringing the borders wide open. If you notice, there's a lot of Ukrainians coming through there. I haven't noticed. And there you're going to use these Ukrainians because Biden has connections with those people. The Ukrainians may set false flags in Europe and America.

Alex Jones  1:12:59
They would they would stand to gain from it.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
And they're gonna dress them up in Trump Trump gear and have them do some stuff and bam, martial law.

Dan  1:13:08
So look out for Ukrainians dressed up as Trump supporters carrying neutron bomb damn martial and also trucks with fuel bombs already gassed up and ready to go. Boy, we got a lot of things to worry about. This is a concern. A if if UK shot of concern

Jordan  1:13:27
if they had, did he say that he's seen? He hasn't seen Ukrainians coming through the border

Dan  1:13:34
because he's so many. He is not so much where

Jordan  1:13:37
what Ukrainians are going through

Dan  1:13:41
Mexico, yeah, they fly. Salvador.

Jordan  1:13:44
What are we doing? If Ukrainians are coming through the border?

Dan  1:13:48
Wow, there's a tunnel from Ukraine to Brazil. And then they

Jordan  1:13:53
ballots from North Korea.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:56
From North Korea,

Dan  1:13:57
you know, the channel I would connect France and the UK. Okay, you know, so they have that. So, Ukrainian Brazil,

Jordan  1:14:06
Ukrainians are in Odessa. And they're like, listen, we could go to the United States, but those motherfuckers you can't trust we're gonna hit Mexico first. We're gonna take the land route to get through Arizona or whatever, we

Dan  1:14:21
might be thinking about this wrong. Okay. You know, there's an Odessa in Texas.

Jordan  1:14:26
It did not know that there's

Dan  1:14:27
an Odessa in Ukraine.

Jordan  1:14:28
Is there a teleportation device between desperate I'm talking Okay, now talk.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:33
I think there's a port you might be right. Yeah,

Jordan  1:14:34
I think we're in Portal territory. That makes it all makes it so a lot easier to get a suitcase nuke through

Dan  1:14:41
I would think so.

Jordan  1:14:43
Anyway, and Biden has connections with, quote those people, the whole country, the whole country.

Dan  1:14:49
So we have one caller who disagrees with Alex interesting. This is a good example of why it's pointless to disagree with Alex on his show.

Alex Jones  1:14:58
Let's race through your calls right now. Let's go to John and Vegas, John. Thanks for calling. Go ahead.

Caller John (721)  1:15:04
Yeah, I'm looking at the Biden transcript right now and I don't see a single thing that you're talking about. I tell you what, what you're doing edging your audience constantly is embarrassing and a shame.

Alex Jones  1:15:21
You're a seminar caller. You said you were calling on the Air Force about the Biden's speech. I can play the clips right now while you're gaslighting. Even the Washington Post said it was basically a declaration of war. They're saying Republicans are planning violence everywhere are you denying he's up there with troops behind him? That's unprecedented for a president to give a speech with troops at nighttime with red light behind him

Jordan  1:15:44
unprecedented

Unknown Speaker  1:15:47
I'm I'm denying that I've had enough I've

Alex Jones  1:15:49
had enough. I said he disagreed that legitimate points I'd talk to you. I'm not gonna play your games. I got stacks, articles them controlling or thermostats. their child's say what the border, they're saying Republicans are about the bill. I'm not even gonna hammer you in play the clips everybody, obviously.

Dan  1:16:07
So this color is a good example of why you can't really inject disagreement on Alex's own show. Even if you have a valid point like how none of the things Alex is saying about Biden speech are accurate. True. Alex could just hang up on you talk over you call you a seminar caller and create fake reasons to not engage with any of your points. He can list off weird, unrelated talking points to distract his listeners, like what exactly does your thermostat have to do with whether or not the way Alex is discussing Biden speech is accurate? I believe nothing to do with that, I

Jordan  1:16:37
believe he was actually speaking literally. And that's because if you if you scan the sentence, then it's actually the stacks of articles themselves that are controlling our thermostats. So that was just letting everybody know that the stacks of articles has taken

Dan  1:16:50
over the Infowars the amount of printing and wasting of paper and non recycling that Alex does taking impact on climate change. Got it to the point where governments have had to control your

Jordan  1:17:02
controlling our thermostats because we can't stop printing sat history

Dan  1:17:06
will reflect our culture was brought down by stacking. Yep. And that's that is a theory, automobiles and stack ease. So Alex can also just like move the goalposts and pretend that if only you've been honest about why you called in, he would have engaged with your points, oh, no, you're just playing games, he cannot play any of the clips and present his unwillingness to present his own evidence as an unwillingness to engage with your games that you're playing, calling and disagreeing with Alex is pointless. And even though the prime directive of our show, you know, to not interfere with Infowars is kind of destroyed because of our presence at the trial. And my plaintiffs, I still think that it's important to point out that this just isn't something that's going to go anywhere. I would not incentivize that behavior. Although and I do kind of wrestle with this because I think that person probably is a listener of our show, because they use the edging.

Jordan  1:17:57
I mean, I'm not saying that we've popularized edging, but I don't think I've really like I haven't heard terrorists edging anywhere

Dan  1:18:06
else. Yeah, like Pez dispenser for protocols. Yeah, I think those are things that might be specifically ours. Yeah. Or at least they give the suspicion strongly. And so I kind of considered not playing that clip even because I'm like, oh, that might be someone who doesn't share but it wasn't fucking with Alex and nothing creating, like, trying to mess with him. Yeah, it was just given a disagreement about the point that he was making and it

Jordan  1:18:34
doesn't necessarily using the edging doesn't necessarily mean he listens to the show. It could be it could be one of those words that just starts to get popularized through the posture. Yeah,

Dan  1:18:44
but the the the the only reason I'm even bringing it up is one I've not played in the past times where I'm like that someone who listens because I don't want to incentivize that right? I don't want people to think like

Jordan  1:18:58
if they listen to get on our show through in writing, right, right yeah,

Dan  1:19:02
I don't want anyone to think of that as like something that is or that will like be Hey, good job fucker without like, that's a knot

Jordan  1:19:13
or a thing that they compete with the way that people compete with each other on like, Oh, if it's funny enough, it'll get on the show. That's not going to happen. Yeah,

Dan  1:19:20
whereas this is just a good teachable moment where this person had a point that Alex could not respond to. And you see the all of the methods that he deploys immediately in order to get out of this call. De legitimize the person as a seminar caller, accuse them of gaslighting say I would play the clips but you don't deserve it because you lied I would engage with your points but you lied

Jordan  1:19:46
and yell over them but

Dan  1:19:47
you disagree with this. Yep. Well, I disagree. And obviously the point is gonna be I disagree with the way you're just cut it off. It's It's It's It's nonsense. You're not somebody who can engage with

Jordan  1:19:59
theirs. No win. Yeah.

Dan  1:20:01
So Alan to the psych warfare guest, John, we're not seeing pathetic No, unfortunately Yeah. And we're gonna we're not gonna listen to much of it because I found it to be a little bit of like, I don't know, boring. But we have one clip here and I don't think that this is exactly the beginning that Alex wanted to this interview,

Alex Jones  1:20:23
Professor Matias Desmond is in studio with us for the next hour plus, he is recognized the world's leading expert on the theory of mass formation, psychology and psychosis as applies to COVID-19 pandemic. He's Professor of Clinical Psychology Department of Psychology, Educational Sciences at Ghent University, Belgium, and a practicing psychologist, he was worked in discussing widely in the media. And he's here with us of course, he's well known for the Joe Rogan show as well. He wanted to get right into Biden's speech professor and just how archetypal it is with at nighttime with troops behind him with red light. I mean, it's right on a V for Vendetta. It's right out of Nazi Germany, it's right out of Stalinist Russia, it's right in North Korea, and and saying our enemies are gonna be bad, and we've got to have a war with them. What did you make of that? And it's great to have you here with us?

Mattias Desmet  1:21:16
Yes, well, this speech definitely puts us at risk of something. And it isn't it entices the people who are targeted, namely those people who are targeted to who are referred to by a President Biden as a maga extremists, that entices these people to act upon their aggression. And that's what should be avoided at all times, because it will be counterproductive and self destructive if people act upon their aggression, because the system can perfectly control aggression. I believe that it is of crucial importance that we stick to the principles of non violent resistance and that we realize that the first and foremost enemy we have to watch is that part of the enemy did this in ourselves, namely, this aggression, that meant that Mike Tyson has to act in a violent

Dan  1:22:11
way. This is not really what Alex wanted. The professor isn't describing a false flag. He's saying that Biden speech was possibly a bad idea because it will be used as justification for people who want to do violent things when they do violent things, right? This isn't good with Alex's concept because it basically is admitting that Alex's community are largely inclined towards violence. They don't have a good handle on that internal enemy, that is aggression and begging for someone to give them a reason to act on it pretty much understood appropriately. This episode has basically been Alex tripping over himself to frame Biden's speech in a way that inflames that aggression in his audience, but pays lip service to not wanting any violence so he can evade any accusations that he's causing and calling for terrorist acts. Right? Put simply, I don't respect anybody who accepts a booking on Infowars. But this guy is coming at the conversation of Biden speech from a completely different perspective than Alex. And I think that their views are actually at odds with each other. Oh, yeah, I disagree with the professor's point, mostly because if taken to its logical conclusion, you end up in a place where criticizing any potentially violent segment of the population is bad, because it will trigger their aggression. But I do accept that his point is at least connected to reality. And it's something that can be debated. Yeah, Alex's position is more or less just rooted in his feelings, and it's not something you can refute at all would be pointless to argue with him about the conversation

Jordan  1:23:35
is Alex saying when the people that have riled up to violence, false flag, and his conversation is actually they shouldn't do violence? Because that is the thing. But if Alex, but if you say that to Alex's listeners, then they won't do violence. And then there will there won't be a false flag because there won't actually be an actual attack. So those two, those two conversations are in direct opposition in terms of

Dan  1:24:09
goals. Well, Alex kind of winks at the like, don't do violence. This is an attempt to, you know, like, his metaphor with the matador, like it is if you just have the metaphor, it is what this doctor or this wrestler is saying. Yeah, like it's this is an attempt to lure you into doing something right. As opposed to it being fake. But but that's not the larger way that unless and I accept this as a possibility. If false flag as a as a term includes people doing things they shouldn't do. Because Biden made them angry, right, then false flag loses any meaning. Yeah, as a term. Yeah. So if Alex is describing that as something that qualifies as a false, right, then I would say We have past the point where anything has any, any definition. Yeah,

Jordan  1:25:06
cuz the idea of false flag has to include I planned this to achieve the opposite of what, theoretically,

Dan  1:25:16
I want something on somebody else.

Jordan  1:25:18
Exactly. I do an illegal thing to frame a person. Yeah. You know, which implies intent. Whereas this is if you include they, quote unquote, tricked me into doing a thing, right. That I wanted to do already, right. That's just responsibility, just called responsible for

Dan  1:25:39
entrapment. Because I didn't like Biden speech. Yeah.

Jordan  1:25:43
It's not really like, I mean, it is a little bit like if you're like, okay, hey, here's a good speech. People shouldn't steal from the grocery store because people need food. And they're like, Oh, that makes me want to steal from grocery stores, and then eat so much. But when I did, it was because he tricked me. It was a false flag.

Dan  1:26:03
Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. It doesn't I like it. Yeah. And I think that one of the things you should take away from this is that regardless of whether Alex is talking incoherently with this metaphor and stuff, or if he really does believe that if you bomb something, because you're mad at Biden's speech, yeah, that's a false flag. Yeah, whatever the case, the term false flag is meaningless to him. It is a signifier of something that is just like, Ah, don't take this seriously. Yeah, for his audience to like, not accept any kind of like, idea that the information space that they live in, and the stuff that Alex disseminates is part of the violence, right as part of inflaming that aggression, right, ignore that. That's what false flag means. Yeah, it means don't include this in your balance of consequences of this worldview,

Jordan  1:27:00
ironically, to return to an earlier metaphor that Alex himself made. If you are taking your three year old daughter to the zoo, and you're looking at an elephant, and you go, that's not fucking elephant. That's a fake elephant, then that's more like what Alex

Dan  1:27:15
is doing. Again, the trip to the zoo has been canceled because Alex needs to report this three hours ago that he ended up

Jordan  1:27:20
a real bummer. Maybe next time, little Lucy.

Dan  1:27:23
So this this interview this guy I found very boring. It's me, he's talking about this idea of like mass formation churches, the the the idea that part of the population has been tricked into thinking COVID is real. And then because of that, he doesn't take a COVID his fate Share, Like, Share, share that we need to do all this stuff in order to battle COVID are in a hypnotic state more or less. But I mean, if you if you listen to it, if you want to go ahead, but if you do, you'll notice that a lot of maybe all of the things that he is describing as being indicative of this, this sort of hypnotic state that people are in, kind of describe people who support Trump, right? And I just I found it to be an uncoupling interview, and he's, he's this kids get his verbal patterns. It's very boring.

Jordan  1:28:22
I hate it. I really don't like that guy's using

Dan  1:28:25
terms that I think Alex is kind of not understanding and dancing around. Yeah, it's just it's I don't care if that makes sense. It's very little to do with what I think is important, which is Alex's response to Biden's speech right and so we will leave it off there. Yeah, but yeah, so be worried about Ukrainian stress. Does Trump supporters really forgotten

Jordan  1:28:45
that already suitcase

Dan  1:28:47
nukes? Yeah, Anytime he's portals. Portals are keeping always be afraid of portals you should be worried about the possibility of fuel bombs and trucks Sure. And also the midterms coming up very very important. Also you notice Alex is like doing all this stuff but he's not saying go vote. He's spending hours talking about the dangers of these false flags but not at all get out and vote there's no real like, there isn't isn't as much like a Infowars is going to sponsor registration drive. None of that stuff more just a be scared of

Jordan  1:29:29
even Hey, listen, Laura louver MTJ you guys you need to be in the office you need to be there he's never like I hope people vote for you. That's never that. I hope people strong arm you.

Dan  1:29:41
He might say that occasionally. People need to go out and support Laura Loomer. But I think more it's like donate her campaign.

Jordan  1:29:48
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's all money. Yeah.

Dan  1:29:52
