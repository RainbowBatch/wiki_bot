Dan  00:59
Hey everybody. Welcome back to knowledge fight I'm Dan. 

Jordan  01:01
I'm Jordan

Dan  01:02
We're a couple dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

Jordan  01:06
Oh, indeed. We are Dan. 

Dan  01:08
Jordan.

Jordan  01:09
Dan

Dan  01:09
JorDan

Jordan  01:10
Quick question for you. What's your bright spot today buddy?

Dan  01:12
My bright spot Jordan. Spoiler alert here for Extreme Rules. Watched the WWE pay per view last night. All right, okay. Okay. And it was fine. Fine. Fine. And then at the end, 

Jordan  01:25
It got extreme? 

Dan  01:26
lights went out. 

Jordan  01:28
Okay.

Dan  01:28
He's got the whole world.

Jordan  01:31
Okay. All right.

Dan  01:32
The Fireflies everywhere. Right. Bray Wyatt comes back. 

Jordan  01:35
Bray Wyatt's coming back coming back. 

Dan  01:37
Very exciting. Okay, very exciting. He's got his lantern.

Jordan  01:40
He's doing the whole thing again.

Dan  01:41
Um, I don't know. I wouldn't say it didn't look exactly like he was back to swamp hillbilly Hawaiian shirt Bray. Gotcha. Okay. I think that that would be a mistake to go back to that.

Jordan  01:53
I think a Hawaiian shirt is always a mistake. Personally,

Dan  01:55
I think that he has grown past that stage. That character has come and gone and evolved into the themed guy. Yeah. Plus, Eric Rowan. One of his guys isn't there anymore. And Luke Harper, the other guy who was in his Wyatt family has now passed away. Oh, shit. Yeah. And so it would be kind of tough to recapture some of what the Wyatt Family was. Yeah, I think it wouldn't be worth going back to that. But I also think going back to the fiend thing might be a mistake at this point, too. So I'm glad that he had his mask off, right, and so like it's not, I don't think it's gonna be horror super villainy thing but rent. I'm so excited to see him back. I don't even watch wrestling that much. And I'm very excited for him. Yes, he's he's a he's an there's something about that Bray Wyatt fella.

Jordan  02:44
It is it is really interesting, because we've talked about him extensively, despite the fact that I never watch wrestling. Sure. And I'm even I'm interested in the character. What's interesting is that it seems like that's a character that is great for wrestling that they really don't know how to make work. You know, they're like, this character is great. Let's try putting him places and then they go, Oh, no, that's not where he goes. 

Dan  03:06
Well, they had the mold of it with like the Undertaker. You had this guy who was like, does he have supernatural powers? Right, kind of? Does he come back from the dead repeatedly?

Jordan  03:16
Let's do the thing where we go like, did he? Yeah, was he?

Jordan  03:19
He went inside some dudes mind

Dan  03:19
It's fine. Yeah, don't worry about it. Don't ask, but he went a little bit far with some of the Bray Wyatt stuff. 

Dan  03:27
that's true, but I actually think that that's okay. 

Jordan  03:31
In a moral sense?

Dan  03:32
No certainly not. But in terms of superpowers, like Firefly Funhouse thing? Sure. I think it's fine because if you really think about it, Bray Wyatt, he had a superpower when he was a swamp hillbilly cult leader, right. And that was largely manipulation. He really good at manipulating people, which is a human superpower that people can have.

Jordan  03:54
Unfortunately in the audio medium you cannot see the pure bug eyes of delight that he has

Dan  04:02
you can see the, manipulation, going into people's heads is kind of an extension of the 

Jordan  04:06
Sure. Sure. Sure. It's an escalation of his already dormant power right? Yeah,

Dan  04:11
you're seeing in there like the battle within their mind is kind of an artistic expression of what the person is going through while they're being manipulated. Right or whatever. You could see that being okay, sure, but once once you've got like indestructibility and all this stuff, that it hurts your presence in a fighting league.

Jordan  04:35
Yeah, the crucial the crucial part of a fighting league is the possibility of loss right? Yeah.

Dan  04:40
So I hope I hope something interesting will happen. I have some faith and fingers crossed. Yeah. Anyway, what's your bright spot?

Jordan  04:49
My bright spot is, Dan

Dan  04:50
manipulation

Jordan  04:55
No, it is that our couch, absolute garbage. Garbage couch. We've had it, it's been torn up, it's time to get rid of the couch. 

Dan  05:03
Well that's the dogs, right? 

Jordan  05:04
So, my wife, that little bit a little bit, my wife comes up with a brilliant idea. It's her birthday weekend as well, to replace everything with a giant beanbag chair. And my friend, brilliant idea.

Dan  05:20
It's that's an interesting gamble. 

Jordan  05:21
Genius idea. We got it. It's eight feet long and weighs several hundred pounds, 140 pounds or something? Absurd. Wow. It's huge. So it's a long beanbag. Oh, man. It's the size of your couch. Okay. It's an entire beanbag. It's a great couch. Yeah, that like multiple people can sleep on and the whole thing. Uh huh. It's incredible. I'm telling you. I fell asleep on it last night. And I didn't mean to. I looked over. I was like, Oh, this is fun. And then I was gone. It was 7am this morning. It was that fast. It's like a cloud.

Dan  05:52
It's the new waterbed. 

Jordan  05:53
Oh, yes. She She wins for ever. Wow. Because that thing is incredible. 

Dan  05:58
It's her birthday weekend and she got you a gift

Jordan  06:00
Well we split it. Okay.

Dan  06:04
That's, that sounds really cool. I mean, like, I don't think I have any negative memories of your couch. But that sounds like still an upgrade. Yeah.

Jordan  06:12
Oh, man. You gotta, I'm going to evangelize for beanbags. I'm not talking about any brand. I don't want anybody to go buy a beanbag. I mean, if you've got eight foot of something that you can fit beanbags in it, you get a couch, man. 

Dan  06:27
It's just you're evangelizing for the idea of like, like those commercials you'd see for milk. Like, it's not, we're not we're not advertising a brand

Jordan  06:38
Brought to you by ABA, the American Beanbag Association.

Dan  06:43
So Jordan today we got an episode to go over. Yes. We're gonna be talking about October 6 2022. That is Thursday of last week, actually, the day that closing arguments were happening and the jury began. Its deliberation, I guess. Sure. Although I guess most of that was Friday. They will be back in session on Tuesday. And I would be surprised if we didn't have a verdict and a damages. claim. The

Jordan  07:12
verdict? The verdict? Word verdict. Sounds good.

Dan  07:15
I said it and it didn't feel right. Trying to find 

Jordan  07:17
because it feels like we're in a criminal trial if you say verdict. 

Dan  07:20
But yeah, that should I would assume that comes down on Friday or on Tuesday, or Wednesday, because at the end of the day on Friday, they were asking, the jury had a question for the judge. Right, which was, is there a reason that Lafferty is name is first? Yeah, among the plaintiffs, it's Lafferty et al versus. Right. And that to me, the reason you would ask that is trying to figure out if some people should get more than like, it's spreading it out among the people or if it's equal, and to me that kind of has the indication of like, we're pretty close.

Jordan  07:56
Yeah, if they're, if they're like, Wait, so if Lafferty is the first name, does that mean that we should get Lafferty a bump, you know, like, Should Lafferty get a little bit of an extra jump? 

Dan  08:08
That's how I read it. 

Jordan  08:08
Yeah, that seems about right. 

Dan  08:10
I'm not sure of another way to interpret it. There might be but it feels like Tuesday's probably gonna be 

Jordan  08:15
Yeah, I would be I mean, I would I would say that our vibe was the broad strokes have been kind of banged out. Now we're getting down to the details. 

Dan  08:23
Yeah. So we'll see about that. But it's interesting to check, in see how Alex is doing on the day of the closing arguments. 

Jordan  08:30
See how it goes. 

Dan  08:32
But before we get to that, let's take a little moment. Jordan, say hello to some new wonks. 

Jordan  08:35
That's a great idea. 

Dan  08:36
So first, Al in Bristol, thank you so much you are now a policy wonk.

Alex Jones  08:39
I'm a policy wonk. 

Jordan  08:40
Hello, Al!

Dan  08:40
our next, kegs. Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk.

Alex Jones  08:42
I'm a policy wonk. 

Dan  08:43
Thank you very much.

Dan  08:47
Next, thank you so much to the Luxembourg hurling goalie Luxembourg City, the grand duchey of Luxembourg, not Germany. Alex, you're fucking dope. Thank you so much. You are now policy wonk.

Alex Jones  08:58
I'm a policy wonk. 

Jordan  08:59
Thank you very much. I love that part of Austria.

Dan  09:01
This allows me to say something kind of fun with that is that sending out these buttons? There's a couple that have gone to Luxembourg. And I wanted to write Luxembourg, France. But I realized like this is not the place where it's

Jordan  09:14
not the time. Maybe you could write it on the inside of the envelope

Dan  09:18
The one setting you don't want to make a geography joke is envelopes.

Jordan  09:23
Oh, I know. But whoever got those in France would have been like this was very funny. 

Dan  09:27
Yeah. Next because of Dan and knowledge fight. I am in to country music. Thank you so much. You are now policy walk.

Alex Jones  09:33
I'm a policy wonk. 

Jordan  09:34
Thank you very much.

Jordan  09:35
I'm a policy wonk.

Dan  09:35
Hey, all right. I'm fine with country. Next scrambled Meggs and her sweet baby Kitler. Thank you so much. You're now policy wonk.

Dan  09:36
Thank you very much, but that's a scary cat.

Dan  09:40
It's a cat with a Hitler mustache. Apparently. They assured me it's not

Jordan  09:53
pro no pro Kitler. No. No cat is not into him. Hitler and the cat is not Hitler.

Dan  10:01
I don't I hope not. Okay. All right. I'm assured that this is a cute thing. Okay. And finally, Susan A thank you so much. You are now policy wonk. 

Alex Jones  10:09
I'm a policy wonk. 

Jordan  10:10
Thank you very much. 

Dan  10:11
Thank you. So Jordan, before we get into this episode, here is a little out of context drop for today's show.

Alex Jones  10:16
And it's stroke out time, baby. WOO! Liberal. 

Dan  10:21
Woo! It's stroke out time.

Jordan  10:26
It's stroke out time baby, woo, liberal. That's, that's, you know, a word has turned into something without meaning whatever. You're just saying it like that. WOO!  Liberal. Okay, what does that mean? What does liberal mean in that context? 

Dan  10:40
Yeah. If Alex, it's sort of, like his git 'er done.

Jordan  10:46
just it's a meaningless phrase now.

Dan  10:49
So we started off here, and Alex is really big into the nuclear war discussion. Sure. And so that's kind of kind of where his head's at. At the beginning.

Alex Jones  10:58
The US government has come out has been secretly buying potassium iodine pills, for not just people in Europe, not just the troops in Europe, not just the CIA, but federal employees. And it's also come out last week that federal employees are preparing emergency evacuation plans to deep underground bases, mainstream news. Wow, mainstream news everywhere that billionaires are already moving into their bunkers, or have already moved into their bunkers in the southern hemisphere. Again, I've had in depth discussions with not one, not two, but three, well known billionaires, about when do they think they should relocate to the southern hemisphere? Is that a good idea? And I said, Absolutely. They said, Well, are you going to relocate? And I said, I don't have all this money. The media says, I do know, I have a trailer my parents paid for on their ranch. That's been our family since the 1820s. And I love it. It's beautiful. It's over the lake and everything else. And we'll just go there and probably die during all this. But that's just how it works. 

Dan  12:04
I also have six houses.

Jordan  12:05
When did your parents buy a trailer in 1820? 

Dan  12:09
No, it's a it's from like a land grant or something like it's

Jordan  12:13
not the trailer? Oh, no. I was like, Where did this trailer for the 1820s come from?

Dan  12:17
No, it's not an antique trailer. So the idea of the billionaires are asking Alex if it's time to bug out is ridiculous on its face. But it's a fun way for Alex to weave in a little complaint about how the courts think he has more money than he does. There's a kernel of truth to the story that Alex was telling about the US government buying a bunch of pills that treat radiation poisoning, but he's just way off. And he's telling the story wrong. This is about a recent $290 million purchase of a drug called Nplate. It's not potassium iodide, as Alex will go on to say and such. But Alex isn't really a details guy. So yeah, this is not the first time that the government administration for strategic preparedness and response has purchased such medication. But it is the first time with Nplate mostly because he was only approved for this purpose in 2021. This is the end result of financing that the HHS began in 2019 on this drug, and it serves a purpose in the Strategic National Stockpile. But it apparently isn't that great of a drug to respond to nuclear attacks, predominantly because it needs to be used fairly quickly after exposure to be effective. Right. So if like a city was nuked, this wouldn't really be that useful. No, this is more like it would be too difficult,

Jordan  13:29
right? This is more like if you were working in a situation where radiation would occur, then you could do that and then on upon the completion, you would then take the drug,

Dan  13:37
I would assume that that would be very helpful use Right, right. This is not a strong indicator that we are more or less likely to be involved in a nuclear confrontation. But right now, this is Alex's big narrative. COVID is eased onto the back burner where apparently millions of people are being killed by the vaccine all the time, and there's a new bombshell every day, but this isn't really varsity storyline material anymore. The audience has kind of burned out on this.

Jordan  14:03
I mean, you know you the first few weeks of millions and billions of people dying every day you're like this is big news. But then after you've seen I began to suppose mathematically 2.3 billion people die in the past two months you know, you're like why is Alex continuing to talk about the story for a, boring

Dan  14:20
for Alex's audience to believe that any of the stuff that he's saying is true. There would have to be bodies piled up in every city

Jordan  14:27
everywhere we would have to be be Monty Python, bring out your dead level.

Dan  14:31
Yeah, so it's tough to focus on that too much. He can only lie about his trial so much before he turns into Lenny Bruce and the prospect of nuclear war is exactly the kind of thing that will keep the audience just the right kind of scared. Thus, we can expect that any headline that even halfway sounds like it could possibly point to Russia nuking the US is going to be covered as proof that that's just around the corner. It's a pretty sweet deal too. Because when Alex makes the stakes that severe it's really easy for him to obscure his obvious support for Putin. Yeah, it's there's that issue, and he sells iodine. It's just like, as Alex would call it a 360 win. All over the place, just win win win.

Jordan  15:12
I do appreciate I do appreciate that. We're we're talking about a guy who's who's like a an inveterate conman and salesman and liar and all this stuff. And it's like, when you're talking about nuclear war and billionaires, and yet you're still adding that like, old time and I talked to not one, not two. That's right. Three billionaires about evacuating from their home, you know, and you're like, Okay, Jesus Christ. This is a nuclear war. What do we 

Dan  15:41
who the fuck are you talking to also, um, I get the flourish that you're pointing out. And I do think it's, it's snake oily. But who are they? I think he wants us to think one is Elon Musk.

Jordan  15:53
Right. Right. I think I think well, yeah, that makes sense. Because he's a piece of shit. The Rogen connection. Yeah. And Rogan's not a billionaire. No, I mean, you know, not yet I guess. Probably Michael Jordan. Oh, Jordan. Jordan is huge. And do evacuations these days. Bezos. No. Bezos doesn't talk to anybody. I think Bezos is a robot. 

Dan  16:15
Bezos isn't going into the southern hemisphere. He's going to space Absolutely. Yeah.

Jordan  16:18
He's going into the safest place he knows. So it's

Dan  16:20
like all of them are go to space. Go to South America.

Jordan  16:24
You're gonna love it up there anyway.

Dan  16:27
Testosterone, right? You need it manliness? Sure its way down go

Alex Jones  16:32
pepper Carlson being attacking my right wing media for pointing out that men have record low testosterone in the year 2022. You look up the statistics. A 20 year old man has the testosterone of a 60 year old man in the 1950s a 40 year old man has a disaster on an 80 year old man. They are putting chemicals in the food and everywhere else to totally and absolutely destroy masculinity, ladies and gentlemen. And that's just how it works to start around turns on your cells turns everything on. And they are doing everything they can to try to block natural testosterone replacement systems that are out there. He had so many great herbs and so many great products by the way, we have Super Male Vitality and alpha power both back in stock Super Bowl XL Lau pressed herbs

Jordan  17:21
smooth. It's like there was a problem. Right? That is that's nationally known. And then for some reason, he just has the solution, man. That's why

Dan  17:29
it's so smooth.

Jordan  17:30
It's so nice.

Dan  17:31
So I mean Tucker is being made fun of for other reasons shot for talking about testosterone levels writing decreased. It's more like the ridiculous man folk that it goes in. Yeah, is is promoting. So that's that's one thing. And then his numbers are way off. testosterone levels have decreased somewhat, according to some studies, although there's also some arguments that can be made that these studies are a little bit like not not as precise as you would want them. Right, right. But yeah, Alex's numbers are highly exaggerated. Let me

Jordan  18:07
let me throw this out at you here's my here's my explanation for it doesn't require any kind of like chemicals in the water or anything. If we're going to say that men in that time period had more testosterone than we do now is it not also possible seeing as how we know that a an overabundance of testosterone leads to aggressive behavior that all those wars we had for a good long while got all those testosterone the men like the most testosterone demanding got those guys out of the picture. Now as a fucking species, we have lost testosterone because of their dumb warfighting. How about that

Dan  18:45
some of that's possible other things that people point to our increased levels of obesity. Sure, that

Jordan  18:50
one makes more sense than mine, but I think I think mine still pretty good.

Dan  18:53
Yeah. You have an interesting bottleneck kind of argument. I don't know. Anyway, that was as smooth of a sales pitch as I've ever seen. Yeah, that was that was that was just was nailed it. So we got a story about a young person who died. And of course, it's got to be COVID related.

Alex Jones  19:15
Look at this lady. You see these every day. Tributes paid to a player after her untimely passing as family says beloved daughter will be sadly missed. Jean Alogliptin played at St. Ange, ladies Gaelic Football Club passed away from a massive heart attack, but they won't even talk about the fact that she was vaccinated, which they confirm. Beautiful, healthy, having a great time getter than a doornail that's the evil we'll have the New World Order Waterford GA, mourn the untimely passing of a young player. She's dead now. Look at that beautiful young lady having so much fun out They're, like my oldest daughter Charlotte looks looks a lot like Charlotte. Dad. Dad, dad

Dan  20:07
leash is a little disrespectful. So this is an article from the Sun that Alex is reading. Nowhere in the story does it say what this woman's cause of death was nor even how she died. All it says is that it was quote, due to illness is a pretty broad category. That's a big one. The article quotes a Facebook post as saying that she had a brief illness, so it's probably not something that was chronic. And on her memorial page, there's a link where you can donate to a meningitis research organization. This doesn't mean that she contracted a severe case of meningitis. But that is a distinct possibility. Given these data points, you would think, anyway, there's no indication that this woman was vaccinated, nor that her passing had anything to do with a vaccination or a massive heart attack, right, as Alex is saying, but that doesn't matter for Alex. For him, every dead young person is a perfect prop to use as proof of his conspiracies. And this has the effect of encouraging harassment of people who knew these tragically, deceased youths. The entire narrative is dumb, baseless, and has the potential to hurt people. So it's right up Alex's alley, mostly because it's easy, and it allows him to make shit up instead of doing any work,

Jordan  21:14
right? Especially considering if you stop and think about what he's trying to argue. And so let's say so this is the Gaelic Football Club who's in the sun, I assume this is an Ireland or something like that. Okay, so in Ireland, the vaccination rates are like 98%. Right? So that means that if you go through the statistics, there are more than one young person dying in a year. Right. So there's like, let's say there's 1000 Young people who die in a year in Ireland, 98% of them, you have to then say, well, it's it's COVID, or it's a vaccine or anything, because they're all vaccinated.

Dan  21:50
Yeah, yeah. That is a sort of a hack. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. But yeah, one of the things I think is really interesting that you can note there is that the article doesn't say anything about heart attack, that is not the case at all. But she is a football soccer player. And this is the go to, for Alex Ryan, the right wing media, their talking points are all about like the soccer players having heart attacks. And so Alex has just used that almost instinctually the knee jerk to say it was a heart attack. And he's just, I mean, he's making shit up about a tragically passed young woman totally and making making her a property. Right? It's,

Jordan  22:30
and it's unfortunate how it's like, it's both so easy and so transparent why they're doing it, you know, like, obviously, look, this young person athlete, in above average shape, in the prime of her growth, like all of those things. And so if even that can happen, you know, then it must be that evil that kind of, and the

Dan  22:52
audience is primed to see those details like young person athlete and think like, it's not right, they're dead totally. And imagine giving them an excuse and an explanation for why this thing happened. But it's just your own made up explanation to serve your own purposes, even though

Jordan  23:11
and even that it's like you, you know, this is so clearly chosen for the narrative reason. Yes. So clearly.

Dan  23:19
So this next clip, Alex gets into some dumb shit, yeah, but I've titled this clip the blood of the jab, because it says that and I thought it was very, pretty fun.

Alex Jones  23:30
Now, here's the big enchilada. This is up on infowars.com, having it added to the live show feed right under the broadcast feed. The blood of the jab is a peer reviewed study of 1006 people who took the jab and what happened to their blood randomly selected 94% of people showed abnormalities in their blood after the jab. 100% of the showed alterations to their blood post injection. This is not normal.

Dan  23:57
The blood of the jam.

Jordan  23:58
Yeah, you can't just say that and not have us be in like a video game where like, oh, oh, you don't know him. He has the blood of the

Alex Jones  24:06
jab deep within him.

Dan  24:10
opens a new quest. Sleeve the blood of the jam. Yes. So a couple quick points. This isn't new. I found a blog post about this narrative from September and it's based on conspiracies that were going around last year. There's a blog post about this on Sgt report and I decided to use that to see where the underlying information on this was coming from. This blog claims quote, three surgeons from Italy conducted a study which found that nearly everyone who gets quote vaccinated for the Wuhan Coronavirus parenthesis COVID-19 I'm sorry, hold on one second, right. Yeah, with mRNA injections ends up developing tainted blood. So far, we're a little off from Alex's initial statement. They are claiming that this is peer reviewed, but it's definitely the same thing Alex is talking about because it includes the 1006 people in this Don't eat right and the 94% number is there to write. In the first paragraph about the Italian surgeons alleged study there's a hyperlink on the words found that which takes you to an article on a blog called 100% fed up with the headline, quote, teacher arrested and jailed for refusing to use students preferred pronouns. I'm not sure like if they just copy and pasted the wrong link, but this has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine story.

Jordan  25:27
Wow. That you know, you've got multiple tabs open you think you've got one on your clipboard and you accidentally on the other

Dan  25:33
I kind of suspect that it's just like to have a hyperlink Yeah, it's just for looks, they make it easy to click on. Yeah, the blog post itself is a reposting of an article on DC clothesline so I followed that link to an article titled quote, study 94% of mRNA jab recipients found to have metal like objects in their blood

Jordan  25:57
so we've we've we've laundered from metal like definitely not computer chip devices blood to now it's just tainted blood

Dan  26:06
right gotcha wild that Alex didn't lead with that metal like object seems pretty attention getting big enchilada worth it.

Jordan  26:12
Yeah,

Dan  26:13
this DC clothesline article is just a repost of an article from Natural News the site run by Mike Adams, the health Ranger, one of Alex's good buddies, and now we've essentially come full circle. Do you see the entire lifecycle of this bullshit

Jordan  26:27
fucking that is oh my god that's that's like sacred geometry like movement in its good fucking honey BS bullshit shape. Yeah. Oh my god, it's

Dan  26:41
the circle of life. From it's awesome. Just

Jordan  26:46
put it on Natural News. And then it'll travel all the way around back to Natural News.

Dan  26:52
The DC clothesline article actually has the same words, hyperlinked in the first paragraph. And these also go to the transphobic article about a teacher not liking pronouns, so they just copy and pasted that mistake happened early on, no one caught it. And it was just copy pasted into all these websites with no quality assurance or even a second thought given anyone even read these. It took a while. But I traced down the study in question and it's a paper published in the International Journal of vaccine theory, practice and research. The journal claims that they only published peer reviewed stuff, but if you consult their page on what it means to them, that just means that their editors give submissions a once over before they publish them. Right, right. They're your peers. Yeah, the words peer review don't mean the same thing to them as they listen if they

Jordan  27:37
can serve on a jury, a jury of your peers than they are your peer review and therefore if they review it that it is peer reviewed.

Dan  27:45
Beyond that it's just a lunatic anti Vax front. Their editor in chief is a man named John Oller, a linguist who has been a big proponent of the discredited vaccines cause autism theories. In fact, Andrew Wakefield himself wrote the foreword for Ahlers book. There are board also includes multiple members of the Children's Health defense, which is just another anti Vax front. This includes that Group's General Counsel Mary s. Holland and their Chief Scientific Officer Brian s. Hooker. A guy named Daniel browdy is also on the board. His most recent published paper is titled quote, the COVID-19 concoction, a recipe for successful psychological operations.

Jordan  28:25
Interesting. That's a that peer reviewed I'm sure, he's also

Dan  28:29
apparently a linguist. A closer look reveals that pretty much all of the board members are anti Vax activist and almost all of them have a history of pushing the fraudulent connection between vaccines and autism. The journal has only existed since July 2020. And their second issue was dedicated wholly to COVID-19. With it includes an article by their editor in chief titled quote, buying and selling with the mark of the beast. This is not a journal to be taken seriously. It's a fraud propped up by anti Vax activists looking to create a legitimate looking facade to capitalize on COVID fears and rising anti Vax sentiment among the right wing. Anyway, that's the source for Alex. That's what he's laundering but he's not even on time with this one. Yeah, at best. He's reporting a bombshell story about an alleged study in a bullshit anti Vax journal at least a month late. Yeah. So that's the big enchilada.

Jordan  29:25
You know, here's here's my pitch. All right. When I become God King in like few weeks, right, naturally, yeah, it's on the clock. Oh. Boy, not doing well. No, he's really fucking up in his in his dotage.

Dan  29:42
It's happening again. The two before what I was referencing is he said in a Tucker Carlson interview like that he is going to be president.

Jordan  29:53
Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh, good for him. Yeah.

Dan  29:55
For him. He said, Well, if I become president, what I'm Gotta become all right. That's

Jordan  30:03
referencing That's confidence. That's the type of psychopathic confidence you need to become president in a certain way. So country Yeah, country wide ruled national rule. When you name things, it has to sound kinda like what it is, you know, like so we've got like the the APA, the American Psychological Association. You know what that is? You get it. You understand that

Dan  30:28
association of psychologists in America.

Jordan  30:31
Exactly. Right. But if you're like the American vaccine Association, and you're one of these dudes, you can't name your shit that you don't get to name it that like, that's my that in my head. That just makes so much sense. I'm just like, Nah, not odd. Yeah, we're like, an abortion crisis center where that the anti abortion pregnancy centers where they're like, oh, we'll teach you what to do. And its prey, you know? And it's like, No, you shouldn't be able to name yourself anything that sounds healthy. Right? You should be like junk food. Abortion Hate. Like that's your name.

Dan  31:02
Yeah. You don't want to like you. You'd be against the like, Greenland. Iceland. Yes, totally. You don't want like some city in the middle of Illinois, to advertise paradise Paradiski. Rado,

Jordan  31:16
you're in Alabama. And if you name your if you're like, trying to neighbors, hey, let's incorporate a town called pears. Blackhawk helicopters dropped down from the skies. That's what we're talking about. All

Dan  31:27
right. Yeah. Look forward to that. Yeah. So Alex plays a clip of John McAfee. From blue gray. It's talking about power, and how it corrupts and what have you, well, no, love doesn't need power. The negative parts inside you. They're the ones that need power to be expressed. Love just

Jordan  31:50
flows. I'm taking that advice from McAfee, right? Interesting.

Dan  31:54
Yes. And so Alex gets up in his head about how like, the audience has given him power. He loves them and respect. Sure.

Alex Jones  32:02
And I'm very respectful of the incredible power that you have given me. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart, because I love the children. What love justice, and I love crushing bullies and scum. That's why they've cast me as a bully. It's why they've lied about who I am. Because they know, truth is contagious. And they know victory when they see it. And it's not just me. That's the victory. It's this crew. It's you, the viewers and listeners and activists or affiliates. It's everyone. It's all of us together on this epic journey. That is the human experience. All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's look at the main threat. The great threat of world war three, and the proxy war. Now spinning out of control, here are some of the headlines. Poland suggests this is one of guardian, US hosting nuclear weapons amid growing fears of Putin threats. They suggest there's a bear live in the woods. I'm sorry, let's see. Of course that's going on. And, and I I know all this from my contacts. But I also just know us weapons doctrine, not two, but three nuclear weapons in Poland since the fall of Soviet Union, but now they're ready. They're poised there and the triggers are live. What an insane escalation.

Dan  33:34
I was making all this up. What an insane series of words. Yeah, he's also pretending that this headline means that Poland is suggesting that they have nuclear weapons there, whereas the actual story is that they requested nuclear weapons be moved there. Yeah, Alex conveniently didn't read the sub headline of this story from The Guardian, quote, request is widely seen as symbolic as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them less militarily useful. Also, this article is about Poland's President making this request of the United States but includes this sentence, quote, The White House has said it had not received such a request shims maybe like the article says symbolic

Jordan  34:18
Yeah, so the polling guys like hey, you know, it'd be nice because this guy is a fucking crazy dude over here. I mean, maybe if we had some nukes, we'd be fine. And everybody's like, we're not actually going to put him there. But we get what you're trying to say, Man, that guy is gonna shoot Yeah, right. Got it. But Gotcha.

Dan  34:33
But like Alex's sort of, you know, his where his bread is buttered right now with the nuclear war fears, right? It becomes like everything is not only a misrepresentation of the headline, yeah, he adds like a hat on top of it. Ya

Jordan  34:48
know, the situation that Poland is in more is like a gas station robbery, where it's just it's just the United States and Poland and the guys like, with his eyes Just kind of pointing back to the gun. You know, like that kind of thing. That's where we're at.

Dan  35:06
That seems about right. Yeah. So, look, there's gonna be a nuke probably, maybe, who knows, maybe it'd be a false flag could be maybe it'll be dirty. It could be anything

Alex Jones  35:13
us buying $290 million worth of anti radiation drugs for use in nuclear emergency and they're running nuclear emergency ads in New York and Denver. And high level federal employees. It's in the news have been given.

Dan  35:29
I got to stop here. What is a nuclear emergency ad?

Jordan  35:32
It's an ad for nuclear emergency.

Dan  35:34
I don't know what he's talking about.

Alex Jones  35:39
Bug Out directions and bug out backpacks and where to escape to in the event of war. The Biden regime is buying tutor 90 million and anti radiation drugs for use in nuclear emergencies. When escalating tensions with Russia, and heightening threats of a nuclear war. Think the globalist might release a dirty bomb or maybe a low yield nuclear weapon claim Russia did it. We're in the age of war, the age of false flag.

Dan  36:03
Yeah. So now let's just imagine a scenario that I think is unlikely. But let's imagine a nuclear a small nuke goes off in US city. Sure, or something like that? Sure. Alex has laid the groundwork. It's a false flag, man.

Jordan  36:16
I mean, I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna say Alex is like, this is a situation where I feel like it's fine if Alex kind of is like, ah, nukes. They're so scary, because, honestly, if a nuke does go off in a city, no one's gonna give a shit what Alex has to say anymore. I don't know if that's true. People will listen, but they're gonna we're all going to be real busy with everything else that's going on.

Dan  36:40
You're not wrong. I think I think I still have a problem with it. If only because of I think I also I'm of two minds. Sure. One side of it is nuclear war very serious, and not to be taken out fully. And people exaggerating the threat of it right. For the sake of us not ending up.

Jordan  37:04
They're not good. Well, no, I actually Oh, no, I read that wrong. Yeah, no, I get what you're saying. You know,

Dan  37:10
if that is what it takes to take things, seriously, chips are like, Hey, let's never get to that point. Right. I can kind of get into that.

Jordan  37:18
Well, if people had acted like that about climate change in the 70s. You know,

Dan  37:23
with Alex, the problem that I have is that he's not doing anything to avert nuclear war or make it less likely right. He is manipulating the audience's emotions in order to sell them bigotry and iodine. Yes, there is that so I find that to be distasteful Yes. I think taking it seriously and like, you know, being like, pretty gung ho against it. Sure. Great, but this is bad stuff.

Jordan  37:51
I am of the opinion that nuclear war is my my preferred Armageddon just because if everybody goes at the same time, then there's no like, bad feeling. What about the blip? Well, the blip would be great, but he would have to take ever but see again, if everybody goes at the same time, there's no hard feelings, you know, and you nobody's gonna miss you. Because everybody's dead. You won't miss anybody the blip people that's the problem is because then you got to work and you got to put everything you build your life on one of the people got flipped and then five years later, they came back and now they got to put their lives together. It's just a whole mess.

Dan  38:28
I don't know man.

Jordan  38:29
I think bang it out in a moment. That's what I'm about.

Dan  38:31
I disagree. I think there's I think it's, it's a great there's a mystery shoe. You know if you have the blue if you don't get blipped right and you have to be like what the fuck was the bullet? Many have a whole new life of like trying to figure out the blip share and then if you did get blipped I mean what you're just in a void right or something I don't exist you not exist, right? Yeah. So that's your you can have that I'll take non existent right you all day. You get blipped I'll try and so are you trying to live without me? Five years. These last five years.

Jordan  39:03
Five years up. Yeah, no, no, that's fair. That's fair. And the workload tried to bring me back would be the same for both of us.

Dan  39:12
It's a natural extension. Yes. Yes. So like I said, Alex, Alex is very much you know, you support Putin is very ominous, which is so bananas but fine. He does try and obscure it in some ways, but this is pretty pretty sad.

Alex Jones  39:29
Russian a leech voice growing anger as losses mountain Ukraine. French news agency demanding Putin do more Vuitton's the moderate. If Putin gets assassinated, like the West has been pushing for and Lindsey Graham has been calling for you're not gonna get somebody like him. You're gonna get somebody far more aggressive. The Russians entire ethos is about being invaded by the Mongols and the Huns and the Muslims and Napoleon and Hitler. Russia didn't start invading places until the Communists took it over. And it was a great engine of evil. Just like America is now an engine, a war mark. For globalist evil we are a captured instrument of evil or the American people bad. No naive, spoiled, dumbed down, lost, but not evil. And the Russians are not evil people either.

Dan  40:23
This is such bullshit. Yeah, it's so hard to even take this seriously. The first glaring problem is that from the early 1700s through the early 1900s, Russia was an empire. Yeah, empires in case Alex doesn't understand this are generally based on expansion. And Russia was definitely into that imperialism. Peter the Great the guy who St. Petersburg is named after famously invaded Sweden. Russia had a long, rich history of expansionism and invasion long and well before Lenin ever came around. Yeah,

Jordan  40:53
I mean, the context where one of the most feared engines of colonialism in history.

Dan  41:01
Another important point is that Putin is not a moderate. He's facing criticism from the Russian elite, but they're not saying that the nuke should start flying. It's more of like a the generals mishandled operations kind of critique and criticism. Yeah, it's pretty wild for people to be doing that since Putin's government passed a law back in March where they could imprison people for up to 15 years for criticizing the military. The only person in that article that Alex is citing who is calling for nuclear weapons to be used is Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who's a hardline Putin loyalist. He's such a Putin loyalists that he's trying to scapegoat the some other people in the Kremlin to defend Putin from criticisms about how things are going in Ukraine. Yeah, another small point, the headline of the article that Alex is using as quote, Russian elite voice growing anger as losses mount in Ukraine, Alex added, demanding Putin do more from his own imagination. Yeah, that is not in the text nor the article. I don't know who would end up in power if Putin were removed, mostly because almost all relevant political opposition in the country has been crushed or imprisoned. And Putin has essentially been in power for 22 years. So it's hard to predict who would descend? Yeah, no matter who it would be. It does not matter. It does not mean that like Putin is not a moderate. Who would come to power not leave that aside. Yeah. ridiculous to say Putin to moderate No, that's just another rationalization for Alex to use to justify his very obvious support for Putin, despite a bunch of stuff happening in the world that makes that support look really bad, right?

Jordan  42:35
Yeah, yeah, it this has got that historical bent of like, it's really smart if you're a despotic tyrant, to surround yourself with people who have billions of dollars all dependent on you existing, because the only way to stop this honestly is for one of those people to assassinate Putin, and that shit ain't happening. So here we are. You know,

Dan  43:01
I thought you were gonna say the good way to be a desperate is to like surround yourself with people even worse than you.

Jordan  43:07
Oh, no, no, no, that's how you get murdered. As a desperate Well, no,

Dan  43:10
but duck is like if someone worse than you is going to ascend that sort of like, body armor. Sure.

Jordan  43:15
Well for other people, but for them, their insider bare your body. You don't want body armor with knives that stab you. Yeah, that's a bad idea.

Dan  43:25
Yeah. stabby body armor. Body Armor is a bad idea. That's not good. So the Russian elites are saying, hey, Putin, you gotta nuke people. Yeah, or something? Sure. The US elites. On the other hand, Alec says some complaints about though of course, they're the problem with their dorks.

Alex Jones  43:41
I've studied the US ruling elite. They've gotten rid of mostly actual warriors and smart people. The word pervert and wanted power and all the rest of it, but they thought they were protecting American power. A bunch of Harvard lawyers to a man and a woman who've never physically killed somebody who've never physically seen a war who've never physically had their head knocked to the ground. And so they have this perception of invincibility is these candy ass lawyers, that they can just Bravada and bully people around because they control American power. And that's not the case. Real people that have launched operations and killed lots of people are very concerned. Because they understand they got a tiger by the tail. Henry Kissinger is 99 years old still articulate. And he says stop now nuclear war is imminent. The globalist don't even listen to their army Budzma now, because you gotta say what now are yours that don't know what they're doing. Starting a nuclear war. These people should all be arrested last month.

Dan  44:53
It's the return of the Omni

Jordan  44:54
Budzma I have just written an entire comic book about an editor and a paper Suddenly gaining powers to be able to edit all newspapers simultaneously. That's that's what I'm about a call.

Dan  45:07
You need inspiration to come back. Yeah, many Budzma. So this clip really makes no sense. No, if you believe any of Alex's narratives at all, all of this stuff that he's talking about shouldn't matter in the least if you kill someone physically or not, doesn't make a difference, because either way, you're acting the way you are because you're possessed by a literal demon. Or at least you're knowingly working for Satan. The kind of insubordination that Alex is describing is just not possible in the context of how he described the globalists. For the US elites. There's no question about following Kissinger's advice because you and Kissinger both work for the devil, and Kissinger is about as high level as it gets for humans on the demon scale. Yeah, he isn't guaranteed. He doesn't just give his opinion about the best way to solve a problem. He's basically like the emissary of Satan for Alex's Yeah, it doesn't make sense. The globalists if they act the way Alex is saying are a farce. There is no discipline in the ranks, which seems super unlikely if the people knew that there was the literal devil who they were disobeying seeing this there's probably consequences for that kind of thing. Yeah, it's the fucking devil. Yeah,

Jordan  46:16
yeah. The devil is operations in Alex's mind have more of a have more of a like fictional hell kind of like, oh, the devil is really not paying attention that much. The Dukes are all just telling people to do stuff and without the ultimate authority of the devil. You know, you can kind of say, hey, Duke, fuck you, you know and the devil is not going to mind because he's the devil. What? Is he going to be like? Don't speak to your superior officer. Like he's a fucking devil. Come on,

Dan  46:43
right. So you have like dorks physically killed people who are working across purposes of the warrior types, like totally, totally. Yeah, like it just this disorganization feels like how Info Wars wrong view like what the devil would do

Jordan  46:59
you ever notice how the devil is exactly as smart as Alex, did you ever notice that on a

Dan  47:05
run a tight ship? The devil devils? Quite a bit.

Jordan  47:12
Like honestly, I think we're going bankrupt right now. I don't know where my money is.

Dan  47:16
The devil is dead is suspiciously involved in his business.

Jordan  47:21
In a way the devils dad also bought him a place to live too. So you know, there's there's something to be said for that.

Dan  47:27
That's interesting. Yeah. So this guy, this next clip really got my ears up. Yeah.

Alex Jones  47:33
Last year, I receive top secret information. And I'm not released yet. Or the start of the next hour or six after I will release this information. And I put myself and commit myself to God chance.

Alex Jones  47:56
I hope you take this information to heart. I hope you shave this information. Because any day can be our last broadcast. Every day above ground is a good day.

Dan  48:05
Okay, so we got secret Intel top secret stuff.

Jordan  48:09
I just I just wish one time in my life. Like I had been watching CNN at like 12 years old. And Wolf Blitzer had been like, we've got some brand new, we've got some scary news out of the White House. I'm afraid to tell you, I'm going to commit myself to God right now you'd like to commend my spirit. Before I tell you this news,

Dan  48:30
breaking news. God helped me.

Dan  48:40
Like, you know, the problem is that the elites have replaced all the murderers. Yeah.

Jordan  48:49
Anyway, yeah, there's that there is that before we

Dan  48:52
get to this top secret news, I think Alex has a little bit of an announcement. Okay.

Alex Jones  48:57
Quite frankly, I'm thinking about not thinking about we've had it set up and ready. I've had it ready for a year, I was gonna be passed. Probably already nights a week, I'm gonna do at least a two hour live show. Commercial Free. I mean, I may have to plug a few times, but not being played times. And we're just gonna take calls and then occasionally have a special guest. So it's all set up. It's all ready.

Dan  49:27
This is probably never gonna happen. Much like the show that's just callers that Alex is just a big apple launch for like a decade. Right around the corner. It's just about to happen. Yeah, I would advise Alex strongly not to follow through with this idea. For one thing, he doesn't have enough content to justify the amount of time he's on air as is and there's no reason to add like six hours a week so that pile. Second, he claims that he's just gonna take calls but that's bullshit. Alex can't stay on task to save his life. So this is going to end up being more rants and begging people for money at the beginning of this show. He said the first and second hours open phones. He gets two calls an hour and 20 minutes into the show. So close. So close. And you know, this is there's a third point to this. And this seems desperate. Yeah, there's no reason to do this show other than to try to make more money. There's no great demand for it. There's no way Alex needs more time to cover the news. What this boils down to is that no one else at Infowars can sell for shit. Oh, and and Harrison's shows clearly aren't bringing in the sales. So Alex feels like he needs to be on air essentially all the time to keep the infomercial going. If that weren't a major factor in this idea, he could easily have someone else host a show. That's mostly callers. Oh, wait, that was the premise of Harrison Smith show before he started getting a bunch of callers that were like, Hey, why won't Alex just say it to the Jew?

Jordan  50:47
How about be a Nazi boy.

Dan  50:49
Another issue is that Alex is a drunk. And these shows if he does them are going to be a mess. Yeah, I guess on that front. I kind of hope he does follow through with them. Yeah, it's unpredictable content, and maybe we'll get some more hatchet throwing but as a whole, this seems like a really bad idea.

Jordan  51:04
Yeah, I would be interested if instead of his current idea, he set it up so that all of his hosts would get together and Daria would be the Social Media Manager, and they would create the evil Chris Gethard show. Who like, could you imagine an evil Chris Gethard show? What would that be like?

Dan  51:26
It would be there would be a literal human.

Jordan  51:34
Actually, it would be the fish Ubud. Right.

Dan  51:37
Alex would be Chris, up Chris

Jordan  51:40
and Murphy. Yes, he would have to be strong. Yes.

Dan  51:46
The agent would be the LLC,

Jordan  51:51
I think Oh, in Oh, and could be a good vacation. Jason. I think Owens got vacation. Jason Britain.

Dan  51:56
Yeah. If we're filling those roles, we might as well just want him to be him. I've got to talk more about vacations on the show. Well, then I would need to be like, you and I could be the Paul Scheer and Jason Van Oh, totally. Yeah. Steel. Yes. This is too far. Right. We've got we're having a good time move along. Yes. So we got top secret Intel course.

Jordan  52:24
Good, bad. I don't think he

Dan  52:27
says it. That sounds about right. I was listening. I'm like top secret Intel.

Jordan  52:34
Anytime now I think this is it. Okay.

Dan  52:37
But I don't know. Okay, because it's not top secret. It's not Intel.

Alex Jones  52:41
And show the big breaking news is this. I didn't just watch that three and a half years ago in the House Armed Services Committee and Senate Committees. There were a bunch of them. I have talked in just the last year many times, to the aid camps, and also the head people at major tech companies. who explained Alex, when you go on Siri, or you go on these things, and it sounds dominate AI sounds dumb. That's on purpose. They don't want you to know that ai 3.0 is already in control. But let me give you a big secret. And I was meeting a year ago, over a year ago with the chief scientist of the number one tech university in America. Now they can debate who that is. But I'm not going to say the name but it's what I say the name of the scientists. And I looked at him. We had this big discussion about the post-human and the AI and all of it, and what their main goal was, I said, Let me guess your main goal or eat steak dinner? Meet with this top, I got to work for Elon Musk.

Jordan  53:56
What are we doing? And I'm sitting there.

Alex Jones  54:00
And I said, I know the secret of AI. I know the secret of your failure. He goes, what is it? And I said AI is only as powerful. AI is only as powerful as we give it if we don't interface with it, and take its directions it fails. And he looked at me he said you're absolutely right. Oh my god.

Jordan  54:24
I mean, I feel like he looked at you and said, What do you mean it fails? What's failure in this search? It doesn't just exist by itself as it just does it become friends with itself. We're teaching it How To Play Chess by playing chess against itself. It's probably fine.

Dan  54:39
Yeah, there's a form of AI that Alex is thinking of, I think is not quite what maybe this fake MIT professor that he's talking to would be working on. The I blew his mind. I guess that this is this Secret intel that he went to dinner with very sounds dumb, because they're trying to cover up the AI 3.0. Right. He's launched and it's very smart. Wow,

Jordan  55:10
that makes perfect sense to me. Yeah. Caught me.

Dan  55:14
i And Alex went and blew a guy's mind at dinner. Yeah, that doesn't sound right, right. I know the secret of AI. I know the secret of your failure.

Jordan  55:23
I will tell you this. If, if a MIT graduate, who is Elon Musk top AI guy was having dinner with Alex and Joe Rogan. I do believe Alex blew his mind many times that night. However, I do not believe it was for any good reason. No, no.

Dan  55:41
I also want to know who the aid the camps are of these.

Jordan  55:45
There's, there's Benjamin Franklin. Sure.

Dan  55:47
Yeah. So here's the AI that Alex is thinking, okay.

Alex Jones  55:51
And I should let me let me give you an analogy. I said, What is the most powerful AI on planet Earth right now? God, by sheer metric ton by sheer human movement, by sheer activity on the face, the planet ants, he said, Tell me. And I said, it's stoplights. But it's primitive technology is programmed in most areas for the flow. Some areas it's not synchronized. But I said it's primitive technology. But humans submit to it. And humans go along with the stoplights. The red lights, the yellow lights, the green lights, the turn signals that yield signs, because they know it makes their life better. So it's humans interfacing with that primitive technology that is the most dominant AI program on Earth.

Jordan  56:42
Sounds right.

Alex Jones  56:43
And the top AI guy, arguably, on the planet, push back and share anyone oh my god, I never saw it like wait, Steve Wozniak. And Joe Rogan goes, that's why he's Alex Jones. Basketball stories. That's just what happened.

Dan  57:04
It's a good story. Good story. Oh, lot of stoplights are timer based, and some kind of pressure,

Jordan  57:13
I'm gonna I'm gonna go even further on a limb. He's wrong. He's wrong. Well, because what's even more powerful is the button that turns the crosswalk sign. But let me tell you something, Dan, a lot of the times that button doesn't do anything. Right. So that's not that's I owe a i It doesn't exist.

Dan  57:35
So the okay, there's some problems with this line of thinking too. Yeah, because here's the deal, like stoplights don't fully need our input, like person, like with the drivers and stuff, right? In order to operate or whatever. Right? Many of them are just on timers. Sure. And, you know, you got five minutes, and then

Jordan  57:59
I'm gonna throw this out there. To Alex, my argument might be that when you are not interfacing with the stoplights, they're still doing what they are doing. That is true, and you are doing different things. Yes,

Dan  58:09
that's, that is true. And then secondarily, yeah, interfacing with stoplights, save so many lives, so many society would not be able to operate in the way that we do with cities and the layout sure of like people needing to get to work and all that stuff. It would not function the way we have it set up if we did not, right. So the argument here, actually would be submit to the AI. Work with the AI well, because otherwise this shit doesn't work.

Jordan  58:43
Well, I mean, but that is that's kind of the Asimov point of view on AI is that like, if we do develop an AI, chances are it's going to be infinitely better at running our society than we are in the same way that you know, an AI program has like a 3800 rate, ELO rating and chess, which is like and the human one is like 2800.

Dan  59:06
Asimov is great. I'm talking about Alex Jones. You're right. I think that he is trying to make an argument that we don't need to interface with AI. That's his argument, but his Well, yeah, obviously he doesn't want AI fiddling around and all this shit. But the example that he uses of his alleged most prevalent AI is something that we do need to interface with, right?

Jordan  59:38
I mean, but at the same time, like what is he talking about that it's intelligent and okay, if I set my coffee makers timer to make coffee for me the next morning, right? I think

Dan  59:50
that there I don't fully understand exactly how all civic planning works and stuff, but I think that there are some, like traffic light Things that adjust based on traffic. Sure, I think some cities do have that. And you could make an argument that's like somewhat rudimentary AI. But I think that when you're talking about the like, machines that play chess against themselves, yeah, shit. Yeah, it's a little different from what x is

Jordan  1:00:16
a little different. It's a little different. Yeah,

Dan  1:00:19
I would guess if this MIT person does exist, right? They were being very polite. Yes.

Jordan  1:00:25
Beyond polite. Well, I mean, because again, now I would argue that Alex, my definition of artificial intelligence begins when artificial intelligence learns on its own, you know what I'm saying? Sure, we're gonna learn something without our help. Now, I'm gonna throw this out at you. The traffic lights cannot do that. That's not true. The traffic lights cannot suddenly be like, You know what? I haven't tried orange before. Let's give it a go.

Dan  1:00:56
Not true. I was at the intersection of Western medicine. And I was yelling at the French

Dan  1:01:03
did isn't it learning? You know, what are you gonna do? So we got some big updates about about the trial. And you know, as we said, this is the day of the closing arguments being made. And Alex is who he gets, he gets a big piece of news.

Alex Jones  1:01:26
We know the last blusters we know they put out. We know they claim are all Russian agents. We know they say men can have babies. So I put out some fake news about 15 minutes ago by accident, because my lawyer, great lawyer, Norm Pattice, up in Connecticut, this rig trial being sanctioned, attacked by the judge not allowed to defend ourselves. He sent me a text and he said they're asking for $300 million. So I, I sit on there. Oh, they want $300 million. Texas asked for 150 million. They got 50 million, but the Texas captured 5 million don't even have 5 million so great. It doesn't matter what bankruptcy they can't shut us down. Are so pissed. I just called him I just got the phone with him. Like 45 seconds ago, right before we went live. And I sat down on the chair. I hung up on our bass. And I said they're asking for 300 million. He goes no. A lot of them have two parents. That's per person. He says it's $7.8 billion.

Alex Jones  1:02:31
me to ask for $7.8 billion for me questioning a mass shooting and weeks of them crying and no evidence saying they got harassed. I never said he might harass these people. I question like Jessie, smaller WMDs in Iraq. What a joke.

Dan  1:02:52
That's all bullshit. Yep. But that's fun. He really enjoys this. Yeah, this BS. I mean, I would be in a good mood if I got to hang up on norm too. Sure. Sure. There is something probably invigorating.

Jordan  1:03:05
Yeah, but I bet he didn't get to slam the I hope it was on a landline. So you really got to boom. Yeah, that would have been nice.

Dan  1:03:13
But yeah, so this puts him in a in a certain mood. And this will play out. And we'll see about that. But first Alex has to take some calls. Okay. He gets a call from a lady who used to be a dumb liberal.

Jordan  1:03:26
Ah, I hate it when those dumb liberals do a thing

Dan  1:03:30
in that time that she was a dumb liberal. She got vaccinated. Full I know she's very worried about

Caller 1 (733)  1:03:37
Oh, but I wanted to ask you what you thought because when I was in just like less, first of all, thank you for waking me up because I feel like I was definitely in a in a leftist trance. And I took the vaccine and so now nervous of my decision from having taken the vaccine. And I just wanted to see what you thought like, is it really? Like, do you think I'm gonna jump dead soon or something?

Alex Jones  1:04:01
Well, we know statistically, it's killed millions and cause problems. Do you say no only is the answer's no, it was kept below 90 degrees or 87 degrees. And so thank God, they didn't store it right. And so two thirds of folks aren't having for people that didn't have a bad effect. Pfizer moderna, you name it, it's got to be kept in seven degrees or below, and it didn't happen. So you probably got a dose that was dead. It's like a live nanotech injection.

Dan  1:04:31
Good save. That's, oh, now we have a built in excuse for why all of the people that listen to Alex who don't have terrible side effects or die from from the vaccine. It's great.

Jordan  1:04:46
I'll, I'll throw this scenario at you. Okay, so I'm out having dinner with Alex and Joe Rogan. And Alex says that to me, it does not blow my mind. I had an incident like the moment he said that I had a vision of me throwing bread in his face, like That was, that was my instant reaction is just like if I was holding bread, I would throw it in his face. There's like, no refuse. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Done now.

Dan  1:05:12
So the rest of the show is weird. Yeah. Yeah.

Jordan  1:05:17
Because he wasn't exactly he wasn't really excited about hearing that they were asking for $7 billion. Was he?

Dan  1:05:22
Well, he was in a fashion Sure. Now I'll say this. The third hour is interviewing guy from the Epoch Times about some election dumb shit. Sure. So I don't care. We're not gonna listen to that. No. So we're coming towards the like, end of the second hour right? And Alex has fucked up right? Maybe not literally fucked up on drugs or anything. I don't even know how to how to hear

Frank Sinatra  1:05:57
and now, the hand is new. And so I face

Alex Jones  1:06:05
final curtains the fine blue eyes

Frank Sinatra  1:06:10
my friend. I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain

Jordan  1:06:21
we're gonna get to calls

Frank Sinatra  1:06:22
I've lived a life that I traveled each and every highway and more much more than this way

Dan  1:06:47
I can't stress this enough. Alex plays the whole song. He played the whole we'll hear even more of it. But Oh, good. This was tough.

Jordan  1:06:59
Just listening to this song. It seems like there's nothing else going on

Dan  1:07:02
watching this. Oh, it was a an entirely different experience. And I don't I don't watch every episode of his show. Most of the time I end up listening. And then if I need to consult something, I'll check the video. But DJ Dan archy sent me this video and was like, You got to see this.

Jordan  1:07:20
i He sent it to me too. And I could not click on it. And I've been kind of interested and now I know.

Dan  1:07:25
It's I think it's one of the rare things that like I can do my best to explain it. Yeah, maybe I'll do it justice. Yeah, but I don't know. Maybe people should see it. Okay. It's that it's that weird. It's so weird. Okay, so he comes in from break with my way. Oh, yes. Already a strange thing for a human being starts mugging to the camera. Sure he starts doing these weird looks these smug like smiles to the camera.

Jordan  1:07:53
So he's trying to do this ironic like, Haha, it's not actually the end for me.

Dan  1:07:58
There's periods where he's doing like thumbs ups. Oh my God. And he also does like sort of arm waving shirts like gesticulating putting his arms out. Right. He doesn't have enough moves. So he kind of get stuck with his arms outstretched like wingspan. Good. Yeah. And he's kind of like just there until he can bring his arms are weird. Okay, it's it's really strange. But there's there's another element to it too. And that is that edited into it? Like the someone who's working the board has like a like video of things like highlights from Alex's career. What and so it's a like four sections on the screen. You know, like what? Split So there's four. Picture in Picture. Yeah, the song is playing yes,

Jordan  1:08:48
we're getting silent video of his greatest hits in four. Yes, Hollywood Squares

Dan  1:08:53
as like a shot from A Scanner Darkly waking lighter him yelling at Marco Rubio on Piers Morgan write stuff from his early career like when

Jordan  1:09:03
you light off the bar like cheers when we walk out fucking feels it feels like that.

Dan  1:09:08
Now the other thing it feels like yeah. Is this is the kind of tribute that someone else gives you later. Yes. Like when your career is over, or you're retiring or something like that. This is how someone else honors you didn't

Jordan  1:09:23
host your own episode of This Is Your Life, right? Yeah. Feels really sad.

Dan  1:09:29
Because Alex is sitting there alone in his studio.

Jordan  1:09:37
He rented out the theater that the Oscars is held in to give himself a lifetime achievement award and I do chairs all across the place just him singing to himself.

Dan  1:09:51
I would argue that this segment is him doing it his way. Weird, uncomfortable self indulgent disrespect. Fall

Jordan  1:10:00
yes yeah.

Dan  1:10:02
Oh god it I had to watch it a couple times. Actually, here's the truth. I had to turn it off a couple times because I was just like, Oh no, like I turned it off within a couple seconds the first time

Jordan  1:10:13
right because you were like

Dan  1:10:15
the weird looks like no makes me feel uncomfortable now that touch Don't look at me so anyway, yeah, it goes on

Frank Sinatra  1:10:28
much more than this. I didn't my way I did it

Alex Jones  1:10:40
I have asked for $7.8 million to intimidate everybody. They'll never get $1 million. It's all alive. They're pathetic. These ambulance chasers these criminals, these globalist all they've done. Crank it up Frank Sinatra.

Dan  1:11:02
Oh, boy, you kind of thought when he started talking. Maybe that was gonna be like the ramp, but no, crank it up Sinatra?

Jordan  1:11:09
Nope. I would say this, right? This is just the wrong context. This is just the wrong context. Because if we were watching like a, a classic, like 1800s French circus, you know, and this is the sad clown section that where they came out. He's playing Sinatra. He's doing this whole thing. Flowers come and raining from the sky standing ovation, he's bowing. And then he goes away. That's a perfect sad clown routine. Right?

Dan  1:11:38
I mean, if this was his farewell to public life, yeah, I'd forgive whatever weirdness is going on. Yeah, for sure. As long as the problem solved long as you're going. I also think here's here's how I think this goes better. Okay. To two song choices that I think would work better than my way. Okay, because my way is really fucking sad. Yeah, it's the end of the it's the end of the night. True. You know what I mean? True. True. True. I think you go with right now.

Jordan  1:12:06
Right now. Okay. Okay. My role Right, right. Right. I see what just

Dan  1:12:11
I think that there's something upbeat about that. Okay, it's dad Rakesh? Right. orky enough for Alec Sure. The other one is Bon Jovi's It's my life. And it's now or never live while I'm alive. Yeah. Because that has kind of the same thing, but it's not like I'm dead. I think I'm dying.

Jordan  1:12:33
I think if I were gonna go out I would have like an IRA song plague like it would be straight up like, oh, the British murdered my family and then I'm gone. That's the way I do

Dan  1:12:43
it. It's just I mean, like, this song is past tense. Yes. I did it my way. It's all I'm doing it my Wow. You know?

Jordan  1:12:51
Yeah. It is. It is not as much of a karaoke song in that context, as you might think. Yeah. But Bon Jovi is garbage. So I'm still a fan of this over that.

Dan  1:13:03
I would probably choose like something like Carly Rae Jepsen, or maybe something from Abra. Levine's let go album.

Jordan  1:13:09
That'd be so I'm picturing you as like a let's call it 7578 year old man you're giving your final lecture at a university and everybody's like shaking your hand and as you're waving goodbye Call Me Maybe no yeah, that's what I hear that's what I hear happening

Dan  1:13:29
now probably like things I'll never say my world I like come on man. Call Me Maybe right away with me. I understand. So anyway, the song okay

Alex Jones  1:13:49
my God we're winning close we're gonna beat them with God solve the song of a winner Romanian image of God we are the best there is. I don't care whether you're a beautiful black skin. What amazing brown skin stop or incredible red skin or yellow skin or pink skin?

Jordan  1:14:07
What is going on

Alex Jones  1:14:08
ivory white skin.

Jordan  1:14:10
What are you doing?

Alex Jones  1:14:11
I love you so much.

Jordan  1:14:13
Stop all forever. Stop it.

Alex Jones  1:14:15
Our blood is our blood, the blood of the jab and I know I gotta go to your phone calls but I am just show just love it. Oh my god. 7.8 billion, who

Dan  1:14:31
is a lot going on there

Jordan  1:14:37
I will say that I have no red sphere of reference for staring down the barrel of what is going to be a millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of dollars of judgment. Yeah, so acting weird makes sense to me.

Dan  1:14:53
That's true. Yeah. And I think like based on his positioning in the like his just the grip Don't chip. Yeah, he can't do anything but be confident. He's gotta Yeah, if he's showing weakness to the audience, then they're like, why would I throw my money away at you when you're just going to have to give it to the courts? Yeah. Or whatever, you know, you're not knowing that that's already what they're doing. But if he shows that publicly, if that's like how he is, then it's like, well, the audience will bail on you. Yeah. If you're not showing, like some kind of a being above it, or last night,

Jordan  1:15:24
right? Yeah. You can't be like, I'm fucked, guys. Yeah, I'm hosed. We're really screwed on this one. Nothing to do. Spike Lee is making a sequel to 25th hour right now. That's how bad it's going. It's not going well.

Dan  1:15:39
So Alex, just the rambling keeps going. And I don't really think that this clip is all that interesting, except for one thing.

Alex Jones  1:15:49
These criminals are so over the top that they think a number like that scares us. The fact that rigor court case and control the judges, and do all of this, she to try to shut me down is what I expect. I expect you to be killed. A long time ago, I had family killed. Who wouldn't go along with this? Who thought they were fighting for America?

Jordan  1:16:15
Did you kill them?

Alex Jones  1:16:17
I'm ready to die for this. But instead, because of gas, my family put in the tank. Hundreds of years of work coming together right now because of them. And because of you. We're having massive victory. And I am so blessed and humbled to be at the very epicenter of the human resistance.

Dan  1:16:38
The fuck is going on with you, man?

Jordan  1:16:39
No clue what is happening. It's just bizarre. Wow. Yeah.

Dan  1:16:43
So I guess he had his family member killed. That's strange. I know what he was trying to say. But he phrased that poorly. Yeah. So I want to know who is a family member who was killed is because he, I think it was Uncle. I think it's Buckley's dad is who he's trying to reference. Yeah. But he wasn't murdered. Sure. Um, if Alex wants to clarify on that, I'd be interested, I'd be interested as well. Now. That's the one thing that I think is interesting. And then a side piece of that. is, this is so funny to me. That like Alex can't get to the second step of I expected to be dead a long time ago. Why haven't Why aren't you? Because you're full of shit.

Jordan  1:17:20
Because you're lying. Yeah, you expected to be dead? Because if what you believed were real, you probably would be Yeah, but it's all fake. It's all pretend

Dan  1:17:30
living in a bizarre spy novel in your head. Yeah, that's why you're not dead yet. Yeah. Yeah. You're not dead by the grace of your audience not having killed you totally. It's probably a more realistic version or like

Jordan  1:17:41
you're not dead? Because for some reason, your weird mental illness, trauma response turned into a business. Yeah, you know,

Dan  1:17:51
or you are. And also, I think probably you had the cautionary tale of Bill Cooper. Sure. And you're not gonna get your sack on that question. Anyway, Alex didn't do it his way, it turns out,

Alex Jones  1:18:03
and I am so blessed and humbled to be at the very epicenter of the human resistance. Because I didn't do it my way. I did it God's way. And that's where we are right now. They want the biggest number, they've got to scare you into submission. But if you submit to them, you get a death penalty in their tyranny. A trillion years in hell total control, your children signed over to them. We are exposing their poison shots. They're on the ropes, not us. They're not us.

Jordan  1:18:46
Sounds right.

Alex Jones  1:18:49
Fauci and Bill Gates and Peter Desi and Klaus Schwab and Lord Rothschild, and Henry Kissinger and all of them are gonna burn in hell

Alex Jones  1:19:06
humanity will populate the solar system will expand their into the galaxy, they will go next level like that.

Dan  1:19:14
I find it difficult to imagine being somebody listening to this and being like, Fuck, he gets it. Yep, this

Jordan  1:19:23
killing it. You know, it's just worrying.

Dan  1:19:25
This seems worrying. Yeah, more than anything. Yeah. On the one hand, it's like, okay, if this is sincere, it's worrying. If it's not, then it's a childish performance. Yeah, it lacks nuance.

Jordan  1:19:37
I mean, if it's not, it's worrying as well. Yeah.

Dan  1:19:41
In a very different way.

Jordan  1:19:42
I feel I feel a little bit jealous of sick Shakespeare now on in a sense that like, in his time, a thing like me thinks she doth protest too much. You know, you're like, that's an appropriate contextual way of describing think that if he said that about Alex, I'd be like No, no, what you should have said is fuck me. That's a lot of protests ancient days is fucking great stop.

Dan  1:20:08
Yeah, you know it lacks the kind of poetic language that a live for.

Jordan  1:20:13
Mine doesn't last as long Yeah, it's a little bit of femoral if you will.

Dan  1:20:17
Yeah, we should be glad that old William Shakespeare didn't have to describe Alex that'd be tough.

Jordan  1:20:24
Oh, I wonder who Alex would be in Titus Andronicus let's recast that one too.

Dan  1:20:30
He's the person who

Jordan  1:20:32
gets brutally murdered.

Dan  1:20:34
So Alex, we're gonna go to the stars you know

Alex Jones  1:20:39
they talk about Beam me up Scotty have been beamed up indescribable our grandchildren will not just go interstellar will not just go intergalactic but will go interdimensional. And if I can pour out My Will genetic wealth. And my genetic don't describe it like to ever again the road for our children. No amount of torture. Oh, stop us. And we are at that point together. You want to take these loaded phone lines here? I am just I am so I'm serious. Like I love this. The biggest defamation case in US history is $241 million. They are so scared of us. They've asked for 7.8 billion with their rig trial. Ah, this is awesome.

Dan  1:21:57
So I guess Alex has been on the USS Enterprise before. That must have been fun. That was fun. Yeah. Beyond that. You can see here how much of a charge Alex gets out of negative attention. That's just such a powerful fuel for him because he's internalized the fallacious idea that consequences and negative attention are the signs of a virtuous person. He's up against this cosmic overpowered evil. So the fact that Alex is facing a giant defamation judgment can only be evidence of how good he is. If he were an evil person, that cosmic overpowered evil forces would protect him from such a thing. But because he's a threat to the devil, he's subjected to the slings and arrows, Shakespeare nice. This is a really dangerous and stupid mindset to have. Because if you think this way, and you're like, I don't know, let's say you're a narcissist, you'll never be able to accept any criticism. Every time someone tells you that you fucked up every time that you get in trouble for something really bad that you did, you'll find a way to convince yourself that the consequences or criticism is just motivated by evil trying to get you off course from your holy mission. Your ability to self assess is completely erased by this mindset replaced by an ability to rationalize any really hurtful or destructive things you do. Alex is afraid to wrestle with the actual impact that he has on the world because on some level, probably or even pilot, possibly subconscious. He knows that that would be the end of his career. His ideology and worldview don't hold up to any actual scrutiny. So his ability to hide behind being a champion for that ideology and worldview would likewise crumble if examined critically, if all consequences are just proof that you're on the right track, then whoever may have been hurt along the way, they're just the unfortunate collateral damage of the war against the globalists. But if these consequences aren't proof that you're on the right track, and they're just people you've hurt, there's no excuse for it. You just don't care how many people's lives you ruined in order to make sure that you're rich and sound interesting on your radio show. That's really the sort of real world version of this.

Jordan  1:24:00
Yeah, I mean, it is it is more fun to be like, Oh, see, we it's bombastic and he's on the radio, and it's entertaining and stuff. But at the same time, I feel like his psychopathy and need for money is the same as like, Howard Schultz or whatever you want. Like, what kind of psychopath has to bust unions at a fucking Starbucks for his extra $100 million. You know, like, it's insane. Yeah, it's the same thing as what Alex is doing. He's, it's just because it's not public, because He's torturing people in silence with their tacit permission, you know, because society forces it on them. Then everything gets fucked up, man.

Dan  1:24:39
Well, and it's not union busting. It's doing a superfluous two hour extra show. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Somehow is less distasteful than

Jordan  1:24:51
but there is that.

Dan  1:24:53
So Alex talks a little bit about the trial here.

Alex Jones  1:24:55
That's meant to make you think we're crushed. Oh, it's over. Why not have it be at trial? Leave them with inflation. How about quadrillion? How about all the universes Sandy Hook? All Time? Oh, that's an escalation everything crying parents their kids got killed. It's Alan shields is fall on and on and on and on and on for eternity. Just thank god. I'm not the goblin from Harry Potter. Like Josh coughs coughs thank God I'm not Chris. Maddy. Thank God I wasn't materialized on this planet to be an agent of evil. Thank God, I'm not these people. And that's why they hate us because they don't have the AllSpark they don't have the connection to the internet. And they're

Jordan  1:25:45
because we're not robots, you

Alex Jones  1:25:49
can still be a schoolteacher, you may be someone that works at JC Penney, you may be a lawyer, you may be a scientist, he doesn't matter how much money you have, or how much money you don't have. It's all a connection to the infinite God. That is the real value and the soulless servants of evil through genetic bloodlines being cut off from God that think we're the cancer. We're taking over the planet. We're all powerful. We're incredible. We're able to do all these bad things, because you're bad. You're a metastasizing cancer and you will be destroyed by your own will. That's why you're unhappy. That's why you're ugly. That's why you're gone. Because you're spiritually dead.

Dan  1:26:33
So I guess chest cough and Matt. First of all, don't have souls. Yeah. Second, we're materialized by demons in order to do evil. Yeah. And apparently have had something to do with bloodlines being bred for soullessness. I mean, this is just yeah, this is just silly old time conspiracy.

Jordan  1:26:56
Yeah, that's that's a good one Illuminati Bloodlines. That one's that one's good. Because that's one where you just respond to that with like, you gotta go. You just gotta go. You just gotta be gone from here's books about tobacco where ever you are, you need to be not there. Yeah, that's where you gotta go. Look,

Dan  1:27:12
it's the last thing I want to hear. But you got to interview someone from the

Jordan  1:27:17
top. This is good.

Dan  1:27:20
Sounds silly. Oh, boy. So yeah, Alex's show though it exists to stand up to the devil.

Alex Jones  1:27:27
And that's why this broadcast was here. And that's why you all supported it. And that's why we did this for the moment we're in right now. To look in the eyes of Satan and say, You are a loser. And you don't control this planet. And we're breaking free from you. The accuser. Oh, that hurt my feet. I'm gonna come back from break take a few phone calls back guest coming up from the epic times. The massive truck news can't find that news actually because my reprints are forming. I'll find it here. Oh, here it is. I found it. Our number three bitten fruit not one, not two.

Jordan  1:28:08
But Allah number three.

Dan  1:28:09

Jordan  1:28:12
Yeah, yes, good. I'd really hurt his feelings now. But

Dan  1:28:14
at the same time that clip he goes out to break saying that his show is the forbidden fruit. Yeah. So if that's true, Well, God is telling the listeners not to listen to this right here. It's forbidden, right? That you're not supposed to eat?

Jordan  1:28:30
I mean, he forbid at one time but then somebody ate it. So like the gates were opened in

Dan  1:28:34

But I mean, I there's there's no bad time to just be like, hey, you know what? This song slaps crank it up. And then you know, then you go back to your radio show?

Jordan  1:33:29
if I was if I was trying the final case, you know, because there's two more trials. Right? If I was trying the final one, I would talk to the judge and just be like, listen, we got to make this a wrap up for the world to see. And I play like clips from the earlier trials. I play clips from Alex talking during the trials and like really lay out the timeline of everything that got to where we were just through the trials and be like, and now I am the king of America.
