00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Air Jordan

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
Alex

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,608
Jones

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,728
I don't like that a lot of these bright spots and up being

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
Food-related

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
We what what else do we have to clean to these

10
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Here's how bad I am at cooking okay

11
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Okay good get them

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
I just been meaning to do that

13
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
But I realized something else that I can

14
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Sam Cooke

15
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
And this is very sad

16
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
I just realized that you can cook chicken in the oven

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,632
Oh yeah totally you can bake it all the time did not know

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
My friend that you can do at all yeah there's a lot of options for the longest time have thought like well if you're going to cook chicken

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Get in a pan

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
And I'm not good at

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
I f*** it up every time it's chicken breast

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,648
Chicken quite a bit but I just realized the other day that I could take a chicken breast

23
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,696
You know marinated up

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Toss it in the oven

25
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,584
Come out right to the point where last night

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,936
I was having trouble sleeping because I was planning to go get a ticket

27
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
Celebrate this new realization

28
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,384
Can chicken broth I am 36 years old I don't know how to live

29
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,040
What does a bright spot cuz you realize there are these things and you know what it's also a realization that there's so much more

30
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
That I probably

31
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,368
Feel is outside of my abilities that

32
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
It feels like that's about food but that's

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
Boudin anybody can eat a chicken you can just go get a chicken that is it about

34
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Discovery

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Shirts about finding out

36
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,752
A new facet of your life after this episode I'm going to go to the Jewel-Osco

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Live my dreams

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Nappy head

39
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,016
I can't do that it's beyond my ability

40
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,904
I rediscovered the red mask Renditions of Dave Attell skanks

41
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Thanks for the Memories and which

42
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
I have told people about for a long time

43
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,304
It's

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,656
Thanks for the Memories classic Comedy album

45
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
And some DJ

46
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
1520 years ago

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,408
Under laid all these tracks to it so there's just a bunch of funk tracks underneath David tells jokes

48
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
We are I like there's Erykah Badu songs it's a copyright I've never heard of Orange

49
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,136
This thing no one has but I rediscovered it it was

50
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
I remember getting it cuz it was back in the Napster days yeah you would find a torrent randomly real

51
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,680
A lot of times things are mislabeled to think of some song by abandoned by another band

52
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
I'm glad to report that it is real

53
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:02,176
Okay I Googled it for a long time I can only find references to it on Last FM page written in

54
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Different languages

55
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
Okay could find it Well that's proof that it's

56
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
It's real find it again

57
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
I have it I listen to it it's kind of thought it was in a dream

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,351
Time but I'll be honest I don't want to listen

59
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
It's not

60
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
Well one the album

61
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
A lot of it

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Does not age well

63
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
I'm positive about

64
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,639
That's another reason that I thought was so

65
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:38,527
Perfectly funny when I was 12 probably now looking back Yu-Gi-Oh

66
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
No tolls

67
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,415
Horrifyingly event

68
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
Like the way he just says

69
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
East is such a fun delivery

70
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
Joe Keller even if some of the material is

71
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
Pretty problematic

72
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,151
Jordan today we're going to be going over May 1st 2020

73
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,295
As a Friday of last week and there's a lot of debris issues

74
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,367
To go over on this episode certainly

75
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
I look like a f****** idiot

76
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
Cuz on Friday varsho I brought up how thrilled I was that no one was covering Alex's ranked

77
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
His neighbors we were doing great felt so good we were like Icarus flew too close to the Sun

78
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,895
But it might have been it is your fault entirely Julie on some level I'm to blame for this and so

79
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,759
I have egg on my face cuz by the time episode got released

80
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
I ever wanted her toes Alex's outburst and I were giving him the all the publicity that he wanted

81
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
Yeah luckily nobody mentioned us in the in the whole night I'm not frustrated about that LOL I'm not

82
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,703
I'm glad I don't have to deal with all of that

83
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
I don't think that we broke

84
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:09,407
The story or anything like that like I think I know that I got some cleats for people who are like

85
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
You know you guys need to credit knowledge fight for breaking the trust I don't I don't believe that we deserve any kind

86
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
Kind of particular credit for like

87
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,487
Alex said this s*** and we talked about it could have been anybody it's not like

88
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
I don't feel any kind of territorial nastu the story

89
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,399
Or anything but I do feel like as a lot of problems

90
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
With the way people are engaging with it

91
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
I will get to that

92
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,567
Over the course of episodes does sort of come up

93
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,919
Butts up before we embark on this year May 1st Adventure

94
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,015
I should

95
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
The first

96
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855

00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,975

Thank you Bonnie and I'll probably walk

102
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
I think you took up people donated on an elevated level we appreciate it very much

103
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
First of all Justin's thank you so much you and Howard technocratic and Drew Dr you thank you so much you are now attacking

104
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
Money off that heroin

105
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Really large

106
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
Drew Hill

107
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,599
It's not dropping Dru Hill which product Cisco

108
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
School that brought us these on song

109
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
Cisco

110
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
So much promise

111
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
Do you like the show do you do we do we could do that even supported by our website

112
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:15,871
Preciate that if you feel so inclined to take that charitable spirit

113
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735
And find a local charity in your area that helps people who appreciates

114
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
That is well

115
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Either very

116
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
So Jordan like I said today

117
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
May 1st

118
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
Friday made a made a lot of Labor absolutely covered

119
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
They were so much coverage of

120
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Alex is in a particular sort of mood which is

121
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
I find boring in many ways but it does say some really stupid

122
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Switch it out of context drop

123
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
From Today Show

124
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Joined it

125
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
He's told a couple of those I went to sickness parties twice twice

126
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:11,423
I like the idea of presenting it is like they recruited me for sex

127
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Which is to say they wanted me

128
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
What they wanted from me is my good f******

129
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
Of course sickness roving around just being like oh I bet that guy f****

130
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
It's good right let's

131
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Pick him up in our van

132
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
I feel like they have a lot of

133
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Options

134
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
Satanist to throw massive orgies

135
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
I believe that in the past he said they were recruiting him because they had like

136
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Psychic powers and knew that he was going to be important later

137
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Was crucial to the Earth's future or some s***

138
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
I believe I remember him saying that he was

139
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,639
He thought it was going to be a sex thing and then they sprung on him yeah

140
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
Is convoluted

141
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,527
So we start at the beginning of the episode and Alex

142
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
He's contradicting his mood for almost 2 days prior

143
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Save the Earth

144
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,559
Because when you have children utility get closer to God you think about

145
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Ancestors of the future

146
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
But I lost a lot of things in you

147
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Don't have children by

148
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Simply saying

149
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Children

150
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Crushed with

151
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Sorrow

152
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Feeling

153
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
Grief that we were able to get this out of control

154
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
We thought

155
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
We screwed around

156
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
But now we got to roll our sleeves up

157
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
Selling my body is commanding me

158
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Commanding me

159
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
To get up off my ass schedule away from the people

160
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,295
Just a few days ago he was talking about how you can't wake people up

161
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
It's f****** over we're done

162
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
I think he's talking to him

163
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
It's constantly fluctuating

164
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
People up is over every cell in my body is screaming at me to wake up

165
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,007
The people pick a leg it's very frustrating

166
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Equip Alexander reveals

167
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
That's how you know how maybe the Illuminati

168
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,503
Was the friends we made along the way that kind of trait bulshit

169
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
If you wants to let you know exactly is the destiny

170
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Lesion

171
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
For them

172
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Psychotic

173
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Dealership

174
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Human world

175
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
The destination the journey is the destination

176
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,151
There is not more beautiful not more open not more free or classically liberal

177
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
But one of

178
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Trampoline

179
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
One of

180
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Forecast

181
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
By then the average person lived

182
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Really

183
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Living

184
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,807
I have a strong suspicion that Alex thinks that the journey to the New World Order is the destination because for him it is

185
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,159
The end goal for Alex's show an entire business model is to never get anywhere

186
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
Because getting somewhere means you have to change something

187
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,095
The New World Order can never be defeated because if they were then why listen to Alex anymore

188
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
And they can't ever really win because then how do you justify the fact that you're still selling dumb pills while this evil dictator

189
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Ship is in place

190
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,359
You need that sweet spot of their impending arrival to be constant

191
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
At all times

192
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Because otherwise

193
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
You've kind of

194
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
He's like cheers

195
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
You know you can do 30 seasons

196
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
But you're always going to be in that

197
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Bucking bar

198
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Also that boot stamping on a human face thing that's for 1984 now Brave New World

199
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,423
The life expectancy in the United States in 1932 was not 30 years it was 61

200
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,983
For men and 63.5 for women

201
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
You have to go back to the 1800

202
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
Schedule. When life expectancy was in the thirties but guess what

203
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
That doesn't mean that the average person live to

204
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
30

205
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
That's a huge misconception about life expectancy

206
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Satistics

207
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,391
That's the kind of thing you'd be here at you here caught confidently being declared by a guy you just talks out of his ass all the time

208
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Someone like Alex

209
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,023
What are you doing if he's mixing up life expectancy with lifespan

210
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,935
There are aspects of medical advancement in sanitation that have helped increase our life spans over the last hundreds of years but

211
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
Generally speaking what do you see these big swings and life expectancy

212
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,663
That's not a representation that most people died at 30 in the 1800's and it's 60 or so by 1932

213
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
This number is heavily weighted by child mortality

214
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
When you see these jumps

215
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,391
That's almost always indicative of a greater number of children not dying in infancy

216
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
Not people who survived childhood living decades longer

217
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,303
As reproductive Health gets better life expectancy goes up

218
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
For this reason

219
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
And because people who are pregnant already greater risk of death

220
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Then someone who is not

221
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
As the number of people who die in childbirth goes down

222
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
Who are generally younger

223
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,383
And the number of children who survived infancy goes down country see a rise in their life

224
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Expectancy

225
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Alex doesn't understand what this District captures

226
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
On the show pretending the most people died at 31 Brave New World was written

227
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
It's all

228
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,183
She just doesn't even understand the topic the very basic topics that he's talking to

229
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Your life expectancy

230
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Is 30 B

231
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Because back then

232
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
People had 15

233
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
Kids in the hopes

234
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Keeping five

235
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
You know it was that kind of like

236
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Don't name it until it's 45

237
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,983
Live like that kind of level of right everybody dies so young

238
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:11,615
Smarticles about like you know like even ancient history

239
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Knock knock

240
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Baby

241
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,575
On a on a small scale shorter than we in the modern world

242
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Well I mean Noah was 1,000.

243
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Who is Elijah

244
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,679
Well there's I'm out talking about like in the Roman world

245
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
20 or whatever

246
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
It's it's a twisting of what these

247
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Discover

248
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
Answers of Engagement statistics

249
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:50,783
It doesn't know how to engage with the idea that these models existed for what the coronavirus was looking like

250
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
And so you said stuff like that

251
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
Maria model we have been given in the last 4 months

252
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,071
The Royal College by development

253
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,191
Station House band

254
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
67

255
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
In the death rate

256
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
We know it is

257
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Confirm

258
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
That they are counting

259
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
In Europe

260
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
China

261
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
And those hospitals is counted as a

262
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Covid death

263
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,895
Alex is perfectly happy to misuse those same models that he's now.

264
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,199
The crying back when his narrative was that

265
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
For Humanity

266
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
There will only be Lone Survivor

267
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,903
Back then it made perfect sense to scare the audience about how there was going to be 3 million Dead from the virus

268
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
Isn't he just pretended those models were reflecting prediction

269
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,095
As opposed to what would happen if no efforts like social distancing a business closures were made

270
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,935
Alex even pushed a model created by the health Ranger Mike Adams

271
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
And had to be corrected by Mike on air that is model is specifically about the unlikely scenario where no mitigation measures were

272
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Were taken

273
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,223
Alex is and has been willfully misrepresenting what these statistics analyses are

274
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
Even though you was all about them just a short time ago he's a real piece of s*** it has the feel of somebody who's

275
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,999
You told me two million people were going to die the only way you're going to be right

276
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Is if two million people died

277
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,143
Anything else if less than that died that's because you're an idiot

278
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Not because you were like

279
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Let's do some

280
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
You're a liar liar

281
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,223
Can sunny out you son-of-a-b**** believe that

282
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,343
Also I understand him saying that you're up in the United States they're calling all death covid deaths

283
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
It's stupid and

284
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,439
It's not confirmed he just making it up but I understand him saying that

285
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:12,095
Extending that to China seems super weird considering the China's release numbers of Shona substantial drop-off in death

286
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
That's being reported

287
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,679
As covid deaths for at least the last month-and-a-half

288
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:22,079
You would think that if the goal was to hyper-inflated these numbers you wouldn't see China who are supposed to be the big bad guys and all

289
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
All this reporting very few covid deaths right now

290
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:31,295
But I was just saying even internally for his own conspiracy just doesn't make sense

291
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:36,415
It look like they're impervious to it so when we thought it was erased Pacific bio-weapon there to be like Siri

292
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
It's not a racist

293
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:44,095
I got to go

294
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
I don't care too much for whatever this nonsense is that he's trying to pay

295
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
I was listening to the show I had a realization that really really hit home

296
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:04,063
That is that people need to take this a little bit more

297
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
What it is

298
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,391
What did the what this show is

299
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,463
It's kind of at least

300
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
The in the most

301
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Present day

302
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,863
It's kind of just becoming an intense religiously-based

303
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Incitement show

304
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,031
The entire tone of what this is what he's talking about stuff that seems like

305
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
Oh this is just a

306
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
Be having the weird political belief no

307
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
He thinks it's Beeman's doing it

308
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
People need to remember that

309
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
Yeah well he's not

310
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Going

311
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Dead now

312
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Definitely Army secretly

313
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Four-channel point when things are so evil

314
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
That you just can't do it anymore you turned completely against

315
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
He said

316
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Children

317
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
It wasn't because you know what it was

318
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
You know what it is

319
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
These people

320
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
Like to her children

321
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
Understand that

322
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
Until all the corrupt bureaucrats all the god

323
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
Those of you that Hayden about these people

324
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
You're going to face God God is so real

325
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
You understand that

326
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
Down here on this planet

327
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
Children

328
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
For your God Satan

329
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
I assure you your new order feeling down

330
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,767
The character of the show

331
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
That's what this show is

332
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,191
Core is just a guy rambling about his extremist version of religion

333
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,495
And accusing all enemies

334
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,823
Of being child abusing Satan

335
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Worshippers

336
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
It's not it is

337
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
It should be treated like that

338
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
I think that should be in

339
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Every

340
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
Article about Alex believes that everyone he doesn't like

341
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,792
He's under the control of an extradimensional alien demon

342
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,400
Who got stranded here when God kick him out of heaven or whatever

343
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,288
Mirror that needs to be apart of the thing cuz it treating him like a political conspiracy theorists at this point is

344
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Is absurd

345
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
He's not selling food buckets

346
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
It's because the collapse is coming he's selling food buckets because an inter-dimensional space being is causing the collapse that's coming

347
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
You can wait

348
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
Four to six weeks because we can tour dimensional space thing is also probably a decade behind

349
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,376
Dimensional you to stay inside because I Collapse

350
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,776
Does the economy and Rob lot like everything comes back to like China is working for the internet are they in

351
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Dimensional space beyond

352
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
All of it is this

353
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,432
And they have rules where you have to agree to it otherwise they won't

354
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:16,832
Do it well developmental not coming up in a relationship

355
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
Maybe it twisted the rules

356
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,976
Boy.

357
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,048
Everything that the man on the globalist

358
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,864
They're telling you to do like social distancing

359
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,264
The business closures all this at the past of this International inter-dimensional Space

360
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
And so that includes wearing masks which explains why Alex

361
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,432
Keeps telling stories about getting in fights with people

362
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
In public

363
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
When your

364
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,344
Walking

365
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
If she can join with the media on the Stockholm syndrome make you do it she's a hero and

366
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
Good

367
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
We're grown men

368
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
Sandy Hook

369
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Okay

370
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Who

00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Shootings and

372
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
I don't want to hear that ladies and gentlemen

373
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Got to pause there because I like to almost said you know what kids are really dying in response to

374
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,480
Is wired

375
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,064
That is a tell

376
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,136
People

377
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,840
Bathing suits of cards are buddy

378
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Illiberal

379
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Catching around it's all sick

380
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
We won't be around here

381
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,736
Panda mask

382
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Great shape

383
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:31,744
A big salad Masters or partisan issue now apparently which is

384
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm thrilled I'm thrilled to see that this is the way the we've decided to to go

385
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,496
Some people have decided to experience things

386
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Is a real bummer

387
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,384
You know it's at wear a blue state or a mask State and their red state or a no mask

388
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
State and somehow that's the world

389
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
Great

390
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,784

I hate Man look

393
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Plugging is great

394
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
There's something else that's better

395
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,096
Warmouth you need your word about use for the word you are Paula beer

396

Should now

399
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:20,128
When so I know that everyone have fun with jokes about Alex eating his neighbors but ultimately

400
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:26,528
As you can hear from this clip before he was trending all over like he doesn't know about that when he's on air

401
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Just giving exactly what he wants he needs word-of-mouth desperately up

402
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,720
You would have gladly paid everyone to do exactly what they did

403
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
On May 1st

404
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,352
On the day of this episode

405
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
Bonds to false claims he ate his neighbors

406
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,496
Already twisting f*** off exactly

407
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,800
Dammit the description of the video is quote

408
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,176

Not from covid-19

425
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
But from the lot

426
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
Down the covid

427
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640

428
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Trigger

429
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Where are you looking at a hundred and something

430
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
And it keeps going it's going to be worse

431
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
There are a further

433
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
People facing prices

00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,952
Levels of hunger

435
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Or worse

436
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,768
That means 135 million

437
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
People on earth

438
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
Are Marching toward

439
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Break

440
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
Of starvation

441
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
An additional 130 million

442
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
Could be pushed

443
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
Do the break and starvation by the end of

444
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
20

445
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
20

446
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
65

447
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Million people

448
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,248
The 300,000

449
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Every single

450
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,880
Bay over 3 month.

451
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
What's not

452
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
The poor people like

453
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Jabez whip story

454
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,560
Eating poor Irish

455
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
He proposed

456
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Let's

457
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Eat the Rich

458
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
Let's eat the elite

459
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
So that's how he's going to spend this and it's spectacular man I swear to God

460
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
We did this

461
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
We did this we set this up we did it

462
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
He's not supposed to be able to jump

463
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:40,672
The General Lee over this f****** nightmare of a situation and millions of dollars

464
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,000
If people just ignored it

465
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,096
We making this video we're going to pretend that he's f****** Jonathan Swift

466
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,984
Bulshit about like I suggested as we eat the elite

467
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,384
The guy for the f****** poor you

468
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
Hold this in with his exploitation of people in the developing world through a hunger crisis

469
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
It's it's all like really

470
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Like it's exactly what

471
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
He would want

472
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
It's perfect from his aunt

473
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,048
Yep and he gets to argue that everybody's just taking a little quip

474
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Contact man

475
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
I don't literally

476
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
I mean kill them I don't literally mean

477
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,192
Eat the Rich everyone knows that

478
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
So instead

479
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:33,152
Twitter Facebook Google all of them took a little 20 second 30 second one

480
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
What's a contact

481
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
Just say that I was at

482
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
My neighbors

483
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
Well I mean you did say this

484
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
My superpowers being honest

485
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
I want after the first few years I got footage

486
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
But I'm literally look at my neighbor's now going

487
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:54,144
Try to hang them up and got them and scan them and chop them off you know what I'm ready.

488
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
My neighbors

489
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Superpower

490
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Combat model

491
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Probably later

492
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,272
The point is is have you thought about that

493
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Because

494
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
My neighbors

495
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
You think I like

496
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,776
That sounds to me like someone who's actually talking about eating people butt

497
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
I mean

498
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Who knows

499
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Swift used to put in a little couple jokes here

500
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:40,992
They're you know he was he's pretty clever little turn of phrase going on there

501
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,344
Well I mean that is that is an essential piece of it

502
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,648
So back to his response video

503
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
Just basically saying the man I was just being Square

504
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Do you watch the video

505
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
I think you're so

506
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Stupid

507
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
But you won't get

508
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,240
Even though during that show I said

509
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Allegory of Jonathan

510
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,896
Lilly did not end

511
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
And further

512
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
That was a metaphysical hypothetical but it's it's really not

513
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,472
Everything I'm joking around here

514
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:38,080
Anybody

515
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
Pilobolus

516
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
Dinos

517
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Vegas

518
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:56,256
He went out of his way on that during that ran to be like I'm

519
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
F****** serious but also

520
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,168
Hey I'm playing both sides

521
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,984
Used such a piece of s***

522
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
It's it's it's great I'm really bummed because everybody ruined that

523
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,176
Clip for me too I was little I had so much fun with a open the Internet site

524
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
And they gave him all kinds of

525
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Publicity and money and

526
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,088
F****** but now it's no fun that you can eat people

527
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
I had so much fun

528
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,976
Yep we were so innocent a few days ago

529
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,096
Where's the last clip from his his response video which

530
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Ends of course

531
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
Commercial

532
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
Naturally but that is why I said of his car

533
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
I'ma say it again

534
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,544
Give Jonathan Swift

535
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,848
290 years ago

536
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Really wanted to eat Irish shoulder

537
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,808
Yeah but we wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on

538
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,856
What are you saying

539
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Say it again

540
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Give Jonathan Swift

541
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,512
290 years ago really wanted to eat Irish children

542
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
But of course

543
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
He didn't

544
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Willie want to eat

545
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
So you're not with him

546
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Illustrating

547
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Absurd

548
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Satire

549
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
So you do want to each other

550
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Which I knew they were

551
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Will do when I get

552
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
That's how we have the

553
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Is

554
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Get a hotel

555
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Here is my

556
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
Modest

557
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
Proposal

558
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
But actually eat

559
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
The people the trigger the global depression

560
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
And this is the end

561
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,680
Is not pointing out absurdity by being absurd

562
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:45,824
Webster defines it as quote a literary work holding up human vices and Follies to ridicule or scorn

563
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
A second definition is code trenchant with

564
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
Irony or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly

565
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:58,368
This is going to end up being a very standard definition and that second part is honestly the part Alex seems to be missing

566
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Tires Direct

567
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
It's targeted specifically toward a societal Vice or Folly which is heightened and laid bare by the use of irony humor

568
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
480

569
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,216
A modest proposal is held up as an enduring piece of literary set Tire

570
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Because

571
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,872
It did what it did was use a grotesque and ironic suggestion to expose and mock the prevailing attitudes

572
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Society had towards the poor

573
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Swift use the idea of eating for children as a way of highlighting how attempts to help the impoverished have been stupid ideas

574
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
And it was a problem to

575
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
To be taken serious

576
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,024
Conversely Alex was not talking about any greater societal folly or vice and his diatribe about eating his neighbors

577
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,376
He was not talking about this as a solution to worldwide hunger like he seems to want to pretend now

578
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:48,032
He was not talking about it because his neighbors were rich and somehow they're the ones responsible for the worldwide depression methinks we can avoid

579
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Boy by going back to work prematurely

580
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
Alex was just talkin about eating his neighbors

581
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Because you imagine a scenario where his children needed food

582
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
It was that simple

583
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
It's not satire

584
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,648
What Alex did fails to be satire because it didn't have a larger meaning

585
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,768
It was just him yelling about how he was an alpha male who was willing to murder and eat peoples whose children wouldn't starve

586
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,120
You can go listen to the whole thing if you want and you will not find a larger meaning to it than that

587
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,216
It's not a methodical active satire that wishes to convey a deeper truth

588
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,056
He was an idiot ranting about is post-apocalyptic murder fantasies

589
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:24,640
But I do believe that Alex did predict the people would talk about

590
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,784
It's amazing it took 3 days for people to pick up on the story but they did and Alex got exactly what he wanted

591
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,416
You can hear them that clip there he's saying that he knew people would take his words out of context and go here. His own site

592
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
This is working essentially exactly how Alex would help and ultimately serves as nothing more than Free Press Bonanza for

593
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,656
And I don't know if there's any other way this could have played out

594
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:52,800
That's why I was so impressed on our Friday episode the people weren't covering the story I thought it was a choice

595
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
You know

596
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
You're very much.

597
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,920
Yeah

598
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
And once folks

599
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
Found out one of the sites ran a story about it before you know it every other site had their own post about Alex eating his neighbors

600
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Who's trying to get the top of Twitter most of the day Friday

601
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
And people were doing that that's where they put his rants over music is just bore Free Press sand

602
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:19,680
You know we saw her to work out with you we love our somalis video how much he embraced at himself

603
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
Too bad red masks rendition of skanks For The Memories

604
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
Didn't go

605
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Viral shirt

606
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
And like I said

607
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
I just don't think there's any other way this could have gone

608
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
Alex knows that if he says completely f***** up things there's a really good chance that people will not be able to resist the urge to make jokes about it

609
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,112
Didn't post articles on high-profile websites about his comments

610
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,232
Everyone probably has good intentions that they think they're what he saying is nuts and they want to mock him or

611
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,280
Think of the coverage will somehow hurt him

612
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
But they're unfortunately wrong

613
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,704
There's probably no way to deal with this but Alex knows that he can essentially hack media attention with extreme outburst

614
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,544
Then you could lie about his intentions and pretend he's doing some masterful satire

615
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:03,200
He gets all the free press exposure from being blocked by everybody and then this down video he puts out where you pretend to Joe

616
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Jonathan Swift

617
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
He gives himself the best chance possible of convincing the most gullible people who come check out his site that maybe he was onto something

618
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
The media lies about him

619
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,048
It's all a plus from his perspective and there's really no way to deal with it except by changing paradigms dramatically

620
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
I would suggest that no one should ever cover his helper

621
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,912
First because they're not newsworthy and anyway

622
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
There's no way that would ever happen though so long as his outbursts are interesting enough for media places to recognize their potential is Click

623
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,432
I think we're all just kind of f***** and we're all going to be stuck in the middle of this trap where Alex knows

624
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
How to get

625
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
Free Press out of people with

626
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Escalating

627
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Insane outburst

628
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,208
And people who are driven by clicks and traffic know that they can also profit off that

629
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
It's a symbiotic parasitic system that we just

630
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,096
There's no way around and there's people who aren't even

631
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,448
Necessarily driven by the same profit motive who are driven by like

632
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
The endorphins they get out of things being posted all night with her exact same joke being naked

633
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
Homemade over and over and over again people

634
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
Putting out memes

635
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
Whatever you can stop that

636
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,088
It's all it's all fun I don't know

637
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,672
Lego there's a part of me that wants it to be like

638
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,000
If you are going to go after him

639
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Do it through our lens

640
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
Just so there's some sort of distance between

641
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,400
That his publicity and

642
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
And what he

643
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
You know what he wants but

644
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:34,336
I don't know maybe maybe that's a little self-serving but I might be a complete like

645
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
Lie I tell myself just to make me feel important man who knows

646
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,600
I just think that there are people who are they they're dealing with Alex one way but he's

647
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Really together

648
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
You know there is

649
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,000
And it's impossible to convince people

650
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
How how

651
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
You should look at this

652
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
Because

653
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
Auto very basic level I'm a human

654
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,984
I completely understand that there's a guy who has a

655
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Professional-looking

656
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
TV show yelling

657
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
But how he's going to eat your ass

658
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Then we left

659
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,688
How can you not

660
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Very funny

661
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
And without Carnival weariness of what he is how he operates how he does these things in order to

662
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,672
You get a rise out of people the benefit Sam

663
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,488
I just I just don't know if there's any way

664
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,816
To curb those impulses in people even if people knew

665
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
If they would do it

666
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
Yeah I don't know I just said I say we get rid of Alex nobody's allowed to put Alex Jones in a headline

667
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
Or in anything he just

668
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
To be called

669
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
White nationalist

670
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
Inter-dimensional space being believer

671
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:47,296
And that's that's what every and every single article and story and tweeted has that as his name

672
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
I don't think that helps him

673
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,904
No maybe I think it I think it might still

674
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Cuz I was

675
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,488
I was trying to kick around ideas of like what you could do

676
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
And one of the things I thought was like maybe make the headline of the story Alex Jones pathetic attempt

677
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Retention

678
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:09,568
But I don't know if that was something that I ate and if you make believe the story that this

679
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,384
This man is so sad

680
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
Is Steve going to give him the attention at least make it bad trying to get detention

681
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,112
I don't know if that would work but it's just a thought

682
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
Arrington

683
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Transparent and sad

684
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
But

685
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
You know the internet here it is is he is a Force for good

686
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
In the world

687
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,400
I don't know what like

688
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
Man said he was going to eat your ass

689
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Bright

690
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
I am at the same time it's not like

691
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,616
It was only an attempt to get attention

692
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,480
F****** struggling on that episode he came back he was crying about his kids

693
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
It's not like

694
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:54,112
It was all a brilliant ruse to get attention

695
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
He was

696
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Horrible

697
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
Ridiculous

698
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Heather

699
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Outbursts

700
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,536
City had

701
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
That

702
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
Everyone turned into a brilliant PR move

703
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
Because of the way they engage with his contact

704
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:14,848
And like I said I'm not shiting on anybody for what they did I understand why anybody would respond to it the way they did

705
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,384
I just also think

706
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,176
I mean

707
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
He went

708
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
EXO

709
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
What do you do

710
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Anyway

711
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,600
How do we keep losing

712
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
Game direct whatever

713
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,768
So in the next hour talks talks about how Trump knows that his numbers are slipping

714
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
Right

715
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
There's one solution

716
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
We are at war with

717
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,776
There was

718
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
That is huge leverage on the planet

719
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
We're shut down regulations they can do whatever they want

720
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,576
They're the New World Order is economically military muscle now but before

721
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
America

722
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,496
He can overpower that override that is wrong

723
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
Panera portal

724
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
Because

725
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,176
Because the internal polling shows

726
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
Depression

727
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,184
People are getting pissed

728
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
Way to stop it is to declare

729
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Cool

730
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
We'll run

731
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
So that's awful hey he'll eat your ass Dan let's direct more attention towards this guy

732
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
The guy who sang that the president needs to do

733
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Declare war with China

734
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
This is a this sounds more like a Coke

735
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Field pitch meeting to Michael Bay

736
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
Like it's got all that okay so no

737
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:10,559
What's going on at the same time as the China is actually secretly at war with us

738
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
And that's why when we got the president in

739
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
Now it's time for the explosions okay

740
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
Explosions everywhere Will Smith

741
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
I don't care

742
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Let's get it done

743
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151
It's good to know that Alex like really gained a lot of his pseudo credibility early on as being an auntie

744
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
Turns out those words that we were injured weren't big enough

745
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
World

746
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
Wars

747
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,655
Awful Wars people who imagine themselves to be able to survive 12:50

748
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
To be those Lone Survivor

749
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,751
Christina Lopes true

750
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
The chance to live out my dreams unless there's a world or what

751
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,967
Our last episode Jordan you inform me that Trump had mentioned that

752
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
He'd seen proof

753
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:05,087
That the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and said

754
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,671
Iji not heard that by the time we recorded

755
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
I regret to have

756
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Seen that

757
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
Maui

758
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
Bad

759
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,143
Alex talks about it here in this next clip a little bit

760
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,263
I will say just not analyze things much just right kind of his responses of course

761
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Which is Mega that problem

762
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
Expect

763
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
They have

764
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,943
Martial law

765
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
Play our journey into a complete depression

766
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,927
But it already worldwide is already rated as the greatest depression

767
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,047
Every metric that is only going to intensify

768
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:55,775
Once we committed to Ally they know the general public likes the sissy pants around

769
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
What present

770
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:03,967
Bombshell info yesterday we already know the media totally ignored it

771
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,343
Viruses man-made it came from the wuhan.lab here's a president

772
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:14,207
You seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence

773
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,815
Wuhan Institute of virology was the origin of this virus

774
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,399
The world

775
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
Health Organization

776
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,751
Should be ashamed of themselves

777
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,591
Call Mike public relations Agency for China

778
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
Yesterday saying he seen

779
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,711
What is suggesting the coronavirus emerge from

780
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
I'm in Wuhan China

781
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
China where the pandemic

782
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,575
This is senior us officials are

783
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,903
Be looking into ways to hold China accountable for its handling

784
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
The virus

785
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Compose the pro

786
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,511
President in the White House

787
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
Discuss tripping China

788
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
Immunity

789
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,423
Open the door for the u.s. government

790
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
19 victims

791
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Still trying her for damages

792
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Ministration officials

793
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
We discussed having you as cancel

794
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,943
Obligations

795
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Sure

796
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Star War

797
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Alex wants

798
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
War

799
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:21,791
Like he's talked about it a bit in the past months in piano

800
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,375
It's getting to a point where he's being really blunt about it

801
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,959
Does he imagine happens after that

802
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,543
What is hematocrit happens after 2

803
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Large

804
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
We're going to have superpowers declare war against each other

805
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,735
What happens that we each choose one champions

806
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,271
To fight in single combat

807
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,063
Whomever wins

808
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,647
Rules the world what happens after this

809
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
Protracted period where we've alienated a lot of our allies over the last couple years looks like

810
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
To fight against us

811
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Imagine most of the Worlds

812
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,055
Allude are generally our allies being too thrilled

813
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
With the idea of us declaring war on China I would imagine it would not be the easiest cell

814
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:19,647
I'd like the White House needs to start hiring people whose only job is it it is to really listen hard and

815
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Tackle

816
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:25,535
Like they should hire Brian Urlacher hair back now

817
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
Take the guy down if he starts to say

818
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,143
I think we should declare and then he's gone

819
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
That's what I would say

820
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,007
And didn't even if it's just a holiday

821
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Still got a tattoo

822
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
Claire's Arbor

823
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
I don't know man

824
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
SMS

825
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Yeah

826
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,319
I don't even know how to have any kind of conversation about it outside of

827
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:55,743
I I I hate I hate this I don't understand why people listening

828
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,791
To him or allowing him to speak

829
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
In any functional way I just don't

830
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,655
Stand it he should be like just

831
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,703
Find he's he gets to stay president

832
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Put them in a box

833
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Put them in a nice little box

834
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
Have him deliver addresses

835
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
People who dressed like the people who were there

836
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
He doesn't tell the difference

837
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,039
Create a fun little mini world where he gets to play act as president

838
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Owen Shroyer is out at a rally of some sort I guess there's another protest against the disc

839
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
Something and all that

840
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:31,327
And so he brings up a couple of things in this next but they think are just like

841
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Real stupid

842
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
We're seeing YouTube and Twitter

843
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Banda videos

844
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,191
California

845
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Is it working

846
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
Actually been doing the tracing

847
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Apps for

848
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
People that stayed in not

849
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,039
Mood

850
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Been out on the streets moving

851
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
People stay in and

852
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
We have the biggest

853
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
New Jersey

854
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
What

855
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,351
What's your true you stay hurting inside

856
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
No Lie

857
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447
You're all scared

858
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
Supposed to die

859
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,199
Uptodown points there and let's take them

860
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,575
So the doctors he's referring to in California Arden Erickson and Artin massihi

861
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Masihi

862
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:29,951
Two of the two of them are they run an urgent care center in Bakersfield

863
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
And they gained a bit of prominence lately because they put out a DIY press conference video where they said we need to go back to work

864
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
So bad

865
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:42,239
You're basing this off the information they've gathered their Clinic which is the first problem with their conclusion

866
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:49,151
They made the mistake of thinking that their sample the people who chose to come into their Clinic with representative of the general

867
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
Relation which it is not

868
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:57,087
Because they found a high number of people who came to their Clinic testing positive but not dying they extrapolated that to the entire

869
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
Population which is just not good work

870
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:05,023
Many many doctors and infectious disease Experts of come out in very critical about their information

871
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,607
And they've been denounced by the American College of Emergency Physicians

872
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
And the American Academy of emergency medicine

873
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:16,287
California state Senator Richard pan who's also a pediatrician and the chair of the Senate health

874
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,407
Committee harshly criticize them and said quote they're really doing this as a way to fish for a tent

875
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
You guys suck and they really just

876
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Exist to give cover for

877
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
People to push the this isn't a big deal narrative

878
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Which makes sense

879
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,391
It's their big hit Infowars they are a 0

880
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,719
The wee-wee tested and

881
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Gave care to

882
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,839
I literally tens of wealthy white affluent people and

883
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,631
Looks like everybody is fine

884
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:46,751
I don't need to worry about the number simulating they're not percent of deaths in Georgia wearing the black

885
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:53,407
I don't need to worry about that I'm not particularly sure what the demographics or even the gross number of people who come in

886
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,711
Into their clinical but it doesn't matter

887
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,575
There's a reason that this is not a statistically representative sample

888
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,439
Just based on the idea that these are the people who chose to come into your clinic

889
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
So anyway that Facebook tracking thing I didn't even care to look in to see what I was talking about a misunderstanding because

890
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,239
Even if I pretend that everything he's saying is totally accurate it's so easy to see how he got the wrong conclusion

891
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,543
If we stipulated information

892
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,895
I'm just trying to say there's a causal link between staying in and there being a bigger outbreak

893
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:30,783
However that link is not established and it's honestly more likely that the relationship goes the other direction

894
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:37,183
In places where there's a larger outbreak people are more likely to take things seriously and follow the stay-at-home guidelines

895
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,767
Hey I don't know I was listen to that going like or

896
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Maybe the people in areas of large outbreak

897
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,983
Know someone who f****** died and are taking it for very serious that could be and you dumb dumb

898
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:57,407
If you find a piece of data namely that in areas with larger outbreaks more people are staying inside you can't report that is

899
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
Staying inside makes outbreaks

900
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Worse

901
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:03,807
I was just trying to justify that absurd theory that I was putting forth but it's just trash

902
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,343
Just trash work

903
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,951
It's definitely a fingerprint of someone who's trying to make information conform to pre-existing

904
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
Conclusion

905
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,559
As opposed to letting information guide them on their way to a conclusion

906
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,095
Which should be Infowars

907
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Motto

908
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Or something

909
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,543
People are avoiding beaches with giant shark outbreaks on them so naturally that must mean that if you stay

910
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Away from a beach

911
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:30,175
Sharks are coming out of everywhere that's the only thing that makes sense to me

912
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,735
Solidthinking yet

913
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,295
So there's some good news

914
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,439
1500 types of assault weapons using the prices

915
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,719
The take the gun

916
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
Sowell

917
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
But just remember

918
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,007
If I don't make it worse I'm going to like that one troy here

919
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:01,407
Canada gun ban wasn't done using the coronavirus situation at all in fact it probably has just about nothing to do with it

920
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:08,063
C1500 models of assault weapons were banned in response to the recent spree shooting in Nova Scotia which was the deadliest

921
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
Mass shooting ever in Canada

922
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:15,999
Over 13 hours a gunman killed 22 people and injured three others at multiple locations around the province

923
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:19,583
I don't know too much about the Killer's motivation or psychology but the

924
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
Eutectic begin as a domestic

925
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Disturbance

926
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,935
Against his girlfriend because that seems

927
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,007
Very consistent in these cases

928
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Can happen

929
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:33,407
I don't know what else to say about the shooting other than they are an absolute tragedy that didn't need to happen

930
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,527
Canada is their own country and if they decide that one of the ways they want to remedy the problem

931
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,647
That they ever experienced is by restricting access to certain types of guns than they have the right to do that

932
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:49,791
It has nothing to do with the virus but Alex needs it appear to be because otherwise the story seems to be bad dangerous

933
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
Domestically Violent Men with guns can be

934
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,143
And that story is not in his best

935
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,935
Interested cover

936
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
That story seems like a really important

937
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
People should Alex

938
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,407
Is expressing this different feeling than Alex

939
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,967
He's frustrated the Trump isn't doing a

940
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
We've proven

941
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,087
Vater China attacked us with a bioweapon

942
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
Trump's not doing anything

943
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
Sewing

944
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Had been

945
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,463
Sort of expressing some of these ideas

946
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
Alex is trying to reassure him here

947
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,095
And he says something that I think is very telling

948
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
You're like okay great

949
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
I understand

950
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
Mitch is going to collapse

951
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
I got to have time to

952
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:43,295
We already have blown up louder operation

953
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,439
Not in full control

954
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
DoubleDown

955
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
Because

956
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,431
Getting married

957
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,991
War with China

958
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:28,863
Stuff is all DeSoto discontinuing trying but he says there you need to replace me

959
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:34,751
I like to starting to talk more openly about replacements

960
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,567
Apparently it's Owen

961
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,383
But I kind of got that sense to it wasn't

962
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,711
It look like it should be Paul for years but I think ball

963
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,271
By virtue especially with him like

964
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,087
Did Alex was wrong about Sandy Hook

965
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,743
I think he might have tried to go out go into business for himself a little too much

966
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,559
Get 20 far out of pocket if you're apologizing Flash

967
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:04,959
Especially not with you you the very clear father-son thing going on between Alex and Owen

968
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:09,055
Some of the more Fringe communities of younger people that could be a prophet

969
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
Edible Market

970
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
Alex gets on doing this next clip talking about how he

971
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,711
You can't submit to his enemies

972
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:21,343
Americans into a ramp that is very disturbing and if you are sensitive to issues about

973
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
Abusive children let's say

974
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,719
Maybe be careful but

975
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Images

976
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Country

977
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,631
Is it war and we didn't start this war

978
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,799
1009 buffeted again if we were getting conquered by something better I join it

979
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
What

980
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
Position

981
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,015
Did not

982
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
You couldn't

983
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
Teachers

984
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,215
Newborn babies

985
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
Masturbation

986
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,455
Crazy it's not true

987
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
The teacher start

988
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
When the baby's born

989
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,671
Stimulating your penis or clitoris

990
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
Pedophiles man

991
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,911
They're vampires

992
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,215
Don't want to just grow your kids

993
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
Screw their innocence and suck them dry

994
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Your child's first

995
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Experience

996
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
He's going to be a nurse

997
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
Moth

998
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Family Show

999
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,767
Why not give him a handy

1000
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
The Who report

1001
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,423
We will start

1002
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,983
Newborn babies

1003
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
You know that mean

1004
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,687
Affordable food now you're insane

1005
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,063
Wow I mean what the f*** is this the

1006
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
Ram

1007
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
Ranting

1008
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,927
About nonsense

1009
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,999
About masturbating infants

1010
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,791
Getting into

1011
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
Just no time at all

1012
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
We got food.

1013
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
12 quarts

1014
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
Who playing is actually not

1015
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
To Get Fooled Again

1016
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
Know if you knew that one

1017
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,799
They want today will not Get Fooled Again

1018
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:54,943
Apparently bolsonaro recently came out on Facebook and made some pretty f*****-up and completely unsubstantiated and it's worth

1019
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
Claims about that with the World Health Organization recommends

1020
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
For children

1021
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,391
This is part of his attack on The Whole30 no virus because

1022
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:09,791
You know he's a strong-arm dictator leader type he's resisting the concept of taking things seriously they could tend to make him

1023
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
Look personally week

1024
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
Pinknews looked into his claims and said he that bolsonaro appeared to be twisting information for

1025
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,799
2010 guy develop with the World Health Organization

1026
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
For parents not children

1027
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,407
By the federal Center for health education in Germany

1028
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:30,271
The guide provides information to parents on how to discuss sexuality and gender with their children

1029
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
And does not

1030
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,319
Encourage sexual behavior

1031
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:39,231
Business Insider reported that it seemed to come from this guy called quote standards for sexuality education in Europe

1032
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:45,375
They review the guide and found that it was quote explains ettore and does not encourage masturbation or homosexuality

1033
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,935
That's the part I was coming down playing

1034
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,079
Most narrowest post results pretty homophobic because he's a huge anti-lgbtq pickets

1035
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,871
And he's been pretty open about that

1036
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
Alex wants this just to be about nurses masturbating in fence but that isn't all bolsonaro was talking about and none of it's even real

1037
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,111
Even bolsonaro seems to realize that he was talking a load of b*******

1038
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
Because he deleted the post

1039
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,439
After it got pretty heavy criticism

1040
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
I was just pretending that any of this is real but its not

1041
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:16,607
It's just a strong-arm aspiring dictator lashing out against perceived enemies

1042
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
Cuz I was just kind of guy

1043
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
Even though he does not know his name

1044
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
No

1045
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:25,567
Cicero

1046
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,967
Rosario know what is it

1047
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,015
Standard pronounces that

1048
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,111
Yeah I think for you I would bolsonaro might be

1049
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
Unhinge right now

1050
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Now probably

1051
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,975
His kids should be going to jail and so

1052
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
We'll see how that goes

1053
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Right now

1054
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,351
Sew-ins next clip

1055
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,191
Alex has he wants this picture

1056
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
On screen

1057
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
And the crew can't find it a little

1058
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Image of my mind

1059
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
About

1060
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,295
Space suit standing in the m in the National

1061
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,087
Parking Authority

1062
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
How about a trout stream

1063
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,487
October

1064
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Is the future

1065
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
I see it

1066
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,911
It'll be the Earth is uninhabitable for humans and let me to space with Fiona

1067
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
We become

1068
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,103
Cut off from the land

1069
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
Now we don't know how to take care

1070
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Marcel's

1071
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,527
Outside environment be so toxic from what's been put into us

1072
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,831
And our immune systems been turned off

1073
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
Pollen in the air

1074
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,327
I was not having an in

1075
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,143
Their whole roll out

1076
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
We can't find it

1077
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,263
Over there in the gym

1078
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,567
Paint on the wall

1079
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Get a gym

1080
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,199
Pull that off the wall I can maybe next time I'll show it to you but

1081
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:12,319
You only work out your mind though we're talking about it

1082
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,879
What heritage do you

1083
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,439
Control a population

1084
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Pauline

1085
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
But

1086
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
It's it's not a

1087
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Let you know

1088
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,639
Everybody get as self-sufficient as you can

1089
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,199
The big cities are nothing but

1090
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Giant

1091
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Pilgrimage

1092
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
Sure

1093
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
Common Sense knows this

1094
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
Time to get out

1095
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
Open splices

1096
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,775
We need to get

1097
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
Get out run while you can

1098
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,223
The clampdown and turn the clampdown off and turn the clamp down on

1099
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,255
Infowarsstore.com good place Wednesday

1100
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,471
Constant these pivots

1101
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
But we talked a lot about the kind of damage Alex Jones does by way of his Crusades against people and how they can leave

1102
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,735
Target has rathmann talked about how his rhetoric has the tendency towards people getting the impression

1103
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,855
That they need to be the tool of God's Vengeance against Alex imagined enemies

1104
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:56,255
What does clip I think represent another element of the damage Alex does the people who are unfortunate enough to believe he knows anything

1105
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
You can just

1106
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
F****** your life

1107
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:04,959
It's one thing for him to profit off people by selling them bunch of overpriced and pointless pills but what are you doing right now

1108
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
Completely destroy someone

1109
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:12,895
Imagine you were committed Infowars listener and believer who lives in the city and you hear Alex repeatedly saying it's time to get out of the Cities because

1110
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
Kilgrave

1111
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,503
Is it not possible that someone might hear that and take him seriously

1112
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
What if you have a good job your homeowner

1113
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,671
What do you have kids of the dynamic web of social relationships already formed their school

1114
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,327
Without you suggesting as a complete upheaval of all those things and he's just flippantly throwing this out there cuz some weird vision

1115
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
Nearby people in space suits

1116
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,399
To protect them from pollen or some s***

1117
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,959
Like this is this could like really

1118
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Cause

1119
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,335
A lot of trouble what's going on with you I will five years ago

1120
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
Systems analyst

1121
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Comcast

1122
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Figures a year and then

1123
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Alex

1124
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
Told me to move

1125
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
So now I live here

1126
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
Idaho that was released great

1127
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
That was the image that I had in my head of like anybody saying the words I moved because Alex said to

1128
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:06,399
Get out of the city and made me so depressed

1129
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
Chop wood

1130
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
Sure that's what I did I can

1131
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
Run a trotline

1132
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,943
I ran out of storable foods to eat my labor

1133
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
I ate his ass

1134
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:25,343
So are we get to guest coming up a little depressing to think about Alex

1135
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,183
Affecting people up to that extent it's not depressing

1136
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
Is the return

1137
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Of a guy

1138
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,303
Who's Leo is Neo

1139
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Is the

1140
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,375
Head of Matrix is on hell yes

1141
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
I do not respect Leo zagami 1 B

1142
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,727
No I'm so I don't care

1143
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,543
You saying about the Vatican

1144
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,079
I don't care at all

1145
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,383
And I honestly

1146
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,943
Got so bored listening to this yes

1147
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,759
Except for when it starts to get a little apocalyptic

1148
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Take towards the end

1149
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
And we have some interesting reveals but

1150
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,647
He's a rattling on about the Pope I don't really care

1151
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
Come on

1152
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,279
A little bit about about Mark Zuckerberg

1153
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:10,143
And I think that Leo reveals he might be a little bit racist

1154
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,727
Obviously Zuckerberg just looks like a robot

1155
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Schematic

1156
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,159
He's just learning Chinese

1157
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,183
He's all day long

1158
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:34,975
Regina

1159
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,791
That's not good

1160
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:44,191
Small Point Zuckerberg wife Priscilla Chan was born in Massachusetts

1161
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
About her from an article in courts

1162
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,615
A first-generation American she grew up in Quincy Massachusetts a working-class suburb of

1163
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
A Boston

1164
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
Her parents were ethnic Chinese who came to the United States from Saigon part of the wave of refugees known colloquially as the Vietnamese

1165
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,063
Boat people

1166
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:05,439
Could you literally put your children on a boat say goodbye and I hope to meet them on the other side says Chan

1167
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,607
The Vietnamese boat people were refugees fleeing Vietnam after the end of the Vietnam War which if you were call ended when the People's Army

1168
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,679
Vietnam took Saigon in April 1975

1169
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,983
You would not think that someone with that element

1170
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:23,103
And their family history would be particularly inclined to love the current Chinese government

1171
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,455
That seems like I would I would be comfortable saying what we just heard

1172
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
An expression of Leo being a

1173
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:34,367
Raging racing that sounds more like a Chinese

1174
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,951
Nobody's American unless you know

1175
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Right

1176
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,863
So the two of them were talking about the how Alex's you know

1177
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
In trouble

1178
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,959
I guess and it turns out that recently

1179
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,543
Marina Abramovic the artist performance artist

1180
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
And Fiona Hill

1181
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,663
The person who Alex attacked

1182
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:02,271
Both of them have apparently said recently something to the effect of

1183
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
I talked to him

1184
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,599
Like oh no like something like

1185
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,415
The guy keeps lying about me or I would be willing

1186
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
To talk to him now

1187
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,023
Alex believes that this is them trying to Parlay

1188
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
Because of course it's okay

1189
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,799
And sold so in the water it's a circle

1190
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
Explain outdoor

1191
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
So does Fiona Hill she wants to make

1192
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,423
They're going to activate the circle that you're going to be trapped

1193
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
Inside

1194
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
This is the other way this game is played like to me and then people

1195
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:04,223
We'll talk to me that's because I wonder what their plan is that why they're talking to me either they're going to

1196
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:09,855
That's a perfect system for never having to actually deal with these people that you've lied about 4 years

1197
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,767
Leo is on mostly talk

1198
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,071
This is Akeem telling Alex that

1199
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
The f****** in time Cheyenne

1200
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:24,191
Always been talking about

1201
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Dangerous

1202
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Because once today

1203
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:35,199
For the mark of the beast with the Miller and Melinda Gates Foundation

1204
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,527
Yes

1205
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,135
Republic

1206
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,159
You're really smart

1207
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:47,743
What is the best belief are you

1208
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
Come on

1209
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
The timeframe of

1210
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,007
Governed by how we we respond it's not as fluid

1211
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,055
It's a general guide but it needs fluid

1212
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,527
2020 will be a year like no other because

1213
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Cars 4

1214
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,855
Illuminati symbolizes something

1215
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,975
Two numbers together this young and Young

1216
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,815
Let's remember this year start there's no years

1217
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
0 dead

1218
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,399
What whatever

1219
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:32,799
Let's leave that aside and just remember that prior to 2012 Leo zagami was going around telling any

1220
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
Anybody who would listen

1221
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,687
At the coming of the year 2012 would bring with it the rise of the Holy Roman Empire

1222
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:45,087
That would have him Leo lion zagami at the end of it because you Jesus

1223
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,671
We did 911 along with for Sama Bin Laden who didn't

1224
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:55,071
Right so I mean like yeah okay great let's listen to you about these these predictions about things that are going to happen

1225
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,655
It seems very relevant to his credibility

1226
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
To ignore those things

1227
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,775
I think it's good to know that he's more humble now

1228
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
Now he's not saying that the end times

1229
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
Going to end with him being this picture

1230
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,759
Yeah he's just saying we're going through the end times

1231
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,599
The only religion that would be allowed in his world is masochism of course

1232
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
Because he's NeoCube Leo

1233
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:22,975
Absolutely I got this f****** guy like

1234
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,255
What kind of stuff it's like

1235
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
It's

1236
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
Hilarious

1237
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,703
Let Alex talk to him and take some seriously it's so funny

1238
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,543
Story how did you wind up here I don't feel don't understand

1239
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,639
As an idea that's funny enough

1240
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,919
You're going to need to

1241
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:47,295
Actually listen to what he saying but unfortunately does say some really funny things like this

1242
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
This is the great testing is now

1243
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,671
Cities would become smart cities

1244
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,207
Smart

1245
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
Reality is smart

1246
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,535
Is a nightmare there was a field

1247
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,095
From 1977 called demon seed

1248
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
They showed the fat

1249
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
This woman was locked

1250
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
She was impregnated by

1251
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Artificial

1252
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
So that's what's coming in 2030

1253
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,663
At your house

1254
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
Who's going to impregnate you

1255
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:22,111
The real bummer I was I was I was hoping to live my life without being impregnated by an artificially intelligent house

1256
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,159
You win some you lose some

1257
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:24,927
Yep

1258
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,719
So that this conversation

1259
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,279
Is awfully off the rails already

1260
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,095
Topic of the end the end time comes up

1261
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,887
I like this is Alex

1262
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
I think if you listen to this

1263
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:40,287
You can't walk away with any other conclusion then he legitimately thinks he's fighting aliens

1264
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:45,663
Digital prison

1265
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,863
Play Vance Troy Amore band species

1266
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,959
Four-legged stilt real potential

1267
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Where You Are

1268
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,127
Leo zagami

1269
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
Scholar researcher

1270
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,503
Launching their full attack

1271
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,855
So I mean like this is this is the stuff that like the way I look

1272
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,927
Should be treated because he's been like

1273
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,231
More successful than anybody

1274
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:37,375
And just because he has a studio that looks legitimate people should not ignore the fact that he believes he's fighting a space demon

1275
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,911
That is

1276
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,727
That should be front-and-center at all times

1277
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,519
This is an apocalyptic

1278
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,079
Extremist religious broadcast

1279
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,103
At its core

1280
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:52,479
And we should never ignore that we ignore it a little bit sometimes because of become burdensome

1281
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,759
Cat pointing it out but

1282
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,063
Like people who are doing these hit

1283
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
On him

1284
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,927
I don't mean hit like a hit job and like a media head

1285
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
0 which one

1286
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,999
Talk about him eating his neighbors

1287
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:08,095
Also be sure you let people know these basically

1288
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,911
Extremist

1289
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,959
Religious wacko

1290
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:19,359
Committed 911 we're not talking about that Leo zagami is responsible for 911 and we're just going to

1291
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Allow that to go

1292
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:24,735
I think even more f***** up he didn't he said he did

1293
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:30,623
Talking about murdering all these people in his past the obviously is lying

1294
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,695
More f***** up if you want people to think that you did

1295
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,535
911

1296
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,583
I gave the order go fuc

1297
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,655
Yourself I think Alex would do a great job.

1298
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
Doing like just opening

1299
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:48,031
In crawl in the ratio that movie martial law

1300
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,639
The only thing that Alex could do that we

1301
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,175
Productive for society

1302
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
Would have been

1303
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,807
That a little bit of talking dramatically over music

1304
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,879
The perfect you could have found your pardon itch

1305
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,927
LaFontaine you could have been there

1306
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,463
Not that good

1307
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:13,375
So you mentioned earlier that whole idea about like demons have to be welcomed in and all that and I like

1308
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,935
You need to tell people what your plan is before you do it

1309
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,983
Absolutely turns out that the globalist

1310
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,591
Might be looking for a way around that rule

1311
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,407
ABC reality

1312
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,431
So they can

1313
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
Translate

1314
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Into this

1315
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,783
Dimension everything that

1316
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
Covington now

1317
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,647
Is only possible to be invited the floor country chose

1318
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,279
Only if you was invited

1319
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,095
His demons and his Legion

1320
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Cyberspace

1321
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
Shorts

1322
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:01,759
Do you remember what happened

1323
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,599
Man

1324
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,135
Conspiracy theories now but yeah

1325
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:12,255
Discern is involved in Demon portals

1326
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,071
A completely different thing as though they're the set like

1327
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
Of course it's not a base

1328
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,399
It's also CERN

1329
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,727
What are what are you f****** talking about nothing

1330
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:28,895
It's also important to recognize that like they're talking about this is very concrete terms

1331
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,199
Poetically talked about

1332
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,295
You know a battle between good and evil within yourself or something

1333
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,599
Did they're talking about this is like

1334
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
The next couple years

1335
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,695
Global Awakening in the last few years

1336
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Accelerator plan

1337
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,071
Which is why the Bible States build it'll be built for like one year

1338
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
A very slow

1339
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
A year

1340
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,239
What is an esoteric mean

1341
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
Couple weeks

1342
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
The specific number of months.

1343
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
Pitbull before we will be

1344
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Chanting

1345
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,927
Armageddon because they will be

1346
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,511
Confrontation between the two sides at one point

1347
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,839
Temptation is it as asset inherited

1348
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:34,431
Who are those Army and what happens when all this goes down

1349
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
Well I mean there's the worcs

1350
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,623
Of course the Goblins ride them the Orcs there's the Ulrich eyes well the Eagles come in and there's

1351
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:46,719
Is Melinda Gates Foundation The Rockefellers

1352
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
F****** Leo zagami

1353
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,815
I love

1354
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,119
That these guys believe in an infant

1355
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
Evil devil

1356
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
But they're like

1357
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:00,031
And he can't get around this problem until 2020

1358
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:06,687
Like he's never thought of it like the devil isn't even

1359
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,967
Another was New Year's Eve

1360
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
But Alex is concerned about like

1361
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Alright

1362
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
Is it proper

1363
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,647
Right

1364
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,951
What happened to come back

1365
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,511
Tulio when's that going to happen

1366
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,215
Prophets risen backup Elijah and all that research

1367
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,775
Oldest what

1368
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:35,103
Let's say around 2025

1369
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,199
This major damn fraud

1370
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
And so

1371
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
The next

1372
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
Four years at

1373
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
The next

1374
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,951
Of course the one that will change the whole Destiny of mankind

1375
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,263
I applaud Alex for not turning that into a trump 20/20 at 11 export

1376
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:06,335
I appreciate that

1377
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Depressed

1378
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,407
Running for his head chopped off

1379
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:15,807
2025 how where did you come upon that number is it because I just asked you that right now and you were like

1380
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Stop

1381
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Also

1382
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
I mean

1383
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
He was saying

1384
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
2012

1385
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Before

1386
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,607
So where was 20-25 in that like

1387
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
He did the math

1388
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Bright

1389
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,959
I don't care is a f****** idiot

1390
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:39,359
13 years from 2012 13 is a powerful number that's the number that Fiona Hill puts on her

1391
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:42,431
Circle circle turns into a

1392
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,223
I dream catcher and

1393
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,247
That's weird

1394
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
Dreams come from

1395
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
From Dan

1396
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,319
I think I lost the thread on

1397
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,671
Earlier in the episode Alex talked about how

1398
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
Owen it needs to take over for him

1399
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,071
Am I might've just thought that was flipping to side

1400
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,655
But the way this episode ends makes me think that Alex is

1401
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,959
Really really thinking about this right now

1402
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Elio

1403
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,543
I want you to move to Austin cuz I probably about the

1404
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
Seriously I don't have

1405
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,383
In prison right now

1406
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,967
We need to get you here on some more bonus we daddy here with Owen everybody

1407
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Show show

1408
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
How's that sound

1409
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,343
Yes please

1410
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,135
The other operations Young

1411
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,183
Lisa needs a placement cell

1412
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,023
If you want to be mixed up in the dock my friend you want to step another real fire

1413
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,631
Give you a job

1414
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
How did weiner showing

1415
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,775
The way show you the way she

1416
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Either way

1417
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,687
You know that answer is

1418
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
You can't afford me

1419
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,855
Got to get paid enough to go work it out

1420
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,879
And whatever

1421
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,951
Like whatever it is that Alex is concerned about

1422
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,999
Imaginary or real

1423
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,071
If he goes Infowars does not survive

1424
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
This business does not work

1425
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,471
Without him there and I think anybody

1426
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:14,848
I will listen to the war room if it's just Leo zagami Rand know about

1427
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
Out of the Pope

1428
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
Mikkel ever know

1429
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:22,272
I'm all about it listen to episodes where he's on and he does that

1430
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,832
God damn it but it seems like it would have to be fun no

1431
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
It's not

1432
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
You may imagine that it is but it's not it's just a

1433
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,000
So I mean we have this here Alex is in this real like

1434
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:36,352
I mean it's ask elating on on two fronts there

1435
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,168
There's the escalation that's coming surrounding

1436
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,216
Him wanting literal War

1437
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:44,800
Regina which is disturbing and very

1438
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:50,944
On the other hand this I my time is pretty much over is escalating as well like

1439
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,016
Frumpy we know we don't have much time left to this

1440
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:58,112
Badtameez already one we lost this round all that kind of talk

1441
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
Too much for concrete

1442
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,208
I need my successors

1443
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:06,048
Owen you're going to take over Leo move to Austin and

1444
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
Do myself

1445
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,144
It's it's it's taking it from the abstract

1446
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
The more concrete

1447
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,496
And that to me is progression right I think of it

1448
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,776
I think it's exactly what you would

1449
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,568
Expect to see but I would have

1450
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:23,968
Expected him to be a little more private about this certainly less desperate sounding talking to Leo

1451
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,272
That is that is a good point that it's gone from

1452
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
I'm just being like

1453
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:31,392
I'm going to my time here is going to end to concrete plans of like

1454
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,720
When my time ends Owen is going to take over

1455
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:38,560
When things are over I want Leo here too

1456
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,096
Ain't nobody really want

1457
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,448
And Leo. Leo does not want to live in

1458
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
That's

1459
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,264
There are very few Disco

1460
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
That's true

1461
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,640
I'm so yammy we come to the end of episode and

1462
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
Yeah

1463
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
I don't know

1464
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:01,088
We got but I might my mood and my tone is maybe a little bit more down than it needs to be

1465
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,392
But I think a lot of that is just because like

1466
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,976
It's tough it's tough to watch people just

1467
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,512
Go to fall into the Trap

1468
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,792
But Alex sets

1469
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:14,144
Hey bums me out at the same time it bums me out that it bums me out because

1470
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,728
I don't like I keep trying to make this point because I think it's important

1471
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,264
I don't begrudge anyone

1472
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,360
For doing what they're doing I think it's bad I think is wrong

1473
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Technically

1474
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,176
I don't think any

1475
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:32,832
I have no interest in yelling at anybody who works for like slate or Salon or do it those places they posted articles

1476
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,440
I adjusted it just bums me out

1477
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
That's

1478
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,560
You know if there's no right there's not a recognition that

1479
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,096
It only helps him

1480
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,192
Anybody who has if you have a platform that you suspect

1481
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
Is larger than Infowars

1482
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Just don't do it

1483
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Spectre

1484
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,152
Have no way of knowing for sure but if you suspect

1485
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:00,224
Publication has more followers than him

1486
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:00,992
Ben

1487
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
Don't do it

1488
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,552
Because the only thing you do

1489
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,928
Did you run the risk of a wider number of people becoming curious

1490
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,232
Going to his sight

1491
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,632
Seeing stuff where he has more control over the I was doing a Jonathan Swift style satire

1492
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,448
You know it's it's not going

1493
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,752
Going to be everybody who ends up

1494
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,800
Falling for it but you run the risk of

1495
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,104
A certain percentage of them falling for it

1496
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,152
And that's not good

1497
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
You should do

1498
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:36,064
Block off those pads as opposed to facilitate them

1499
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,344
The second wave

1500
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Coveted

1501
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Like

1502
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:46,048
Weedy platform to Alex a while back and look his numbers have gone way way down and so then the first

1503
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
Stopper tunity it's like

1504
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,448
Let's give him his wider platform as we possibly can

1505
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,728
We were winning

1506
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Well he was going away I don't think the people look at it as

1507
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,152
Helping him that's the crucial disconnect

1508
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,992
The people have is they think that negative attention is bad for him

1509
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:09,088
And they don't recognize that he plays a different game but then maybe

1510
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,136
Normal people do

1511
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,440
Because most people if you had

1512
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,328
Most people if you were to have like a video of you yelling about how you're going to eat your neighbors

1513
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
Embarrassingly

1514
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,400
You know

1515
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:28,800
Someone covering it would be a thing where I got to get a statement of apology I need to clarify

1516
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:35,200
Whatever but for someone like a lien in retention out of it

1517
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,224
More negative attempt

1518
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:41,600
And so that it just I'm at strategic changes need to be made and

1519
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,952
I would love to say that I know exactly what that is but I don't really

1520
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,744
I just I think that

1521
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,792
Calling out what the

1522
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,632
Things for what they are in terms of like look at this desperate loser

1523
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,192
I think I might help but it also might not

1524
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
I don't know if there might actually be no solution

1525
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
And that's

1526
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
McKay's

1527
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:05,152
Whatever I don't know I guess the only thing I can think of is that he doesn't talk about us

1528
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,432
No ghetto so

1529
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,504
There's room there's something about what we do that

1530
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,064
Is immune from his

1531
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
Feeding off of

1532
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,136
Negative attention it seems that way

1533
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:20,256
But maybe it's just again if that could just be self-serving

1534
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
Maybe we just

1535
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,704
Completely off the radar

1536
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,264
But that's the thing is like

1537
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
ANM

1538
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
Again

1539
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Just a theory

1540
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
I think

1541
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,664
If you're going to cover Alex

1542
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,808
You need to find ways to make it so anybody who has attention to the thing that you're covering

1543
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
Will it it's negative

1544
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
For Alex app

1545
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,184
You have to you have to almost put

1546
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,232
Within what you're doing

1547
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Fail-Safe

1548
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,584
And that's why I think it's okay

1549
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,376
For us too

1550
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
Laugh

1551
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
And make fun of

1552
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,776
Alex's beating people.

1553
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,080
Anybody who could come to us

1554
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,640
I don't think would ever

1555
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:14,528
We like to check this guy out there is a safety to it

1556
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
That where is

1557
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,344
An article about him

1558
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Might not be

1559
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,696
I don't know our explaining how we might be a terrorist

1560
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,000
And then they played me this bees but

1561
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
Thing and I'm like

1562
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,120
Maybe they're lying about him and maybe just love meeting but I don't know

1563
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,400
Yeah I don't know I don't

1564
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,448
I don't think there's a good answer

1565
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
I don't I don't know

1566
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:40,128
But until then we website

1567
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:46,528
Also on

1568
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:52,928
Are you like the others do Cleveland Heights in Wrigley review patreon dead if you would like please find a local charity

1569
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
Donate to help

1570
01:26:55,232 --> 01:27:00,096
No you're the Seltzer review this the time I kind of forgot

1571
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,888
But

1572
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,704
Leo on dzx

1573
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Clark I am the juiciest Ice Cube

1574
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,872
Alex

1575
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,920
In color
