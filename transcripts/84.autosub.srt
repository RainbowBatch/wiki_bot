1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,864
Holding

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
Same color

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,496
I love your work

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,288
Hey everybody hello

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,688
Come back to knowledge fight I am Dan we are a couple dudes you like to sit around drink novelty Beverages and talk a little bit of

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:25,088
About Alex Jones oh yeah is there is there a catch to it is there a Twist camera

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
That's right moving on after everybody

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,768
Complaining about how dark my camera is which fairly reasonable

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,048
You know I kind of liked it

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
I gave you some

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Sense of Mystery

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Certainly

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,448
Unlike Alex Jones you don't crave the spotlight

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,312
See my I want to hide in a hole and make fun of his dumbass

15
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,896
Right but now the camera so you can see my luxuriant curls

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
Everybody

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
OK Google

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
I know a lot about Alex Jones and user do not I don't know right there's where we find our fun

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,928
Today we're going to be doing an interesting in-depth

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:03,232
Exploration of a past event

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Well we were going to do this at our lives show that we had to cancel

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
Here we go. So today we'll be going over what Alex Jones did

23
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,336
On December 21st 2012 the day of the Mayan apocalypse

24
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,664
I got on there and had some fun

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Did it happen

26
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
It didn't it didn't happen

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,272
I did not we can confirm that the world is

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Still here

29
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
We will be drinking Faygo today in honor of the

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
Greats

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Descending upon DC to fight the ants

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
They're doing but that's what they're doing it's not a fair now everybody's calling it that

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,752
I'm clear that there today I'm sure did not put out a statement

34
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
Elucidating exactly what they were doing

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,176
It's very clear what they're doing they've been labeled a gang by the justice

36
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Department

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
The Juggalos are labeled a gang and

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
That is fun

39
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Incredibly inappropriate

40
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Not just that but they

41
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Because of that

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
They

43
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Have had their kids

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Take a note

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
All of this s*** they've lost jobs

46
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
Like urine or lost parole if any of its probable cause

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
To be searched

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
If you get pulled over and you have a hatchet man tattoo

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Man that's like that it's

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Incredibly ridiculous

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
Solidarity with our Juggalo brothers and sisters

52
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Juggalos and juggalettes

53
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Big whoop whoop going out to you

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,064
I love everything about you except your music and

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
That's what I would you rather me talk about net in

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Oh s*** going on up there

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,008
Thank you so much for joining up with the team we really appreciate it

58
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,360
If you out there would like to become a policy walk you may do so by going to our website

59
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688
Which is knowledge feit.com quickly support the show button

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
And we will

61
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Take all your money

62
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
That's that's naked capitalism right they're not happy with how that came out of my mouth

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
What's the issue with a couple other people in the last week

64
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,752
All the other co-host suck and I'm so happy that I have perfect jobs

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,592
Better

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
But it's thrilling to be back here with you and then also just like

67
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,784
The work of doing it every day I started to get used to it and then taking a couple days off

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
I like I'm eager

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
For The Fray

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
So I didn't know what to do with you

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Yourself for those couple of

72
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,864
Computer like you think about it

73
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
Quickly become an addiction but

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,288
Instead I just sort of thought about cleaning my room into

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Did not find out I was about to

76
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Thanks

77
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
So let's get into it but before we get into the actual episode here is a fun out of context drop from Alex Jones

78
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Weather

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Personnel

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
The man

81
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Weatherman weatherman

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
They just screamed weather weatherman

83
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,079
He's Furious about Job the smallest

84
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Dumbest thing he can

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
Can think of no-one is

86
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Complaining about weatherman especially men

87
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
He's a man we have the Mayan apocalypse to deal with who cares if it's weatherman or not

88
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:48,255
That clip is actually from a 2015 episode

89
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
Absolutely

90
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
Ben from the relevant episodes but I couldn't find a good like

91
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Slip it from this cuz there's just

92
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Wholesale Insanity drop

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,383
So Jordan let's talk a little bit about the Mayan apocalypse

94
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
I want to talk more about this

95
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Stop weather

96
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
How do you get to be the top weather

97
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Was there a competition

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
You gotta pay the cost to be the boss

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
You got to go through you got to go through all the ranks

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
You know like it's sort of like a Mortal Kombat tournament so it is weathering

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
Obelisk don't step to Tom Skilling

102
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Piano character too many a man

103
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,239
To get to the top of Chicago's weather man

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Game

105
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Is that better

106
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
The context of that drop was that

107
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
French weatherman

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
I was saying the climb

109
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
And so

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
To go to

111
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
France's top weatherman

112
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:47,903
To get some good climate change denial from Alex if I had taken out more of that drop again

113
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
It's really funny because he's like I don't want

114
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Bad things about

115
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
French

116
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,143
Things about the French I'm sure it's never

117
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,031
I looked at that freedom fries thing that was fun nobody is ever called them cheese-eating surrender monkey

118
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Because I'm sure never never

119
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
I'm so

120
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
I think Willis tree

121
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Might have dropped

122
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
The tiny bit if it does I apologize will it'll be up

123
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
So

124
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
Let's let's jump into this we are in

125
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
2012

126
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Okay we are back on

127
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Sorry about that we are here

128
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
In 2012

129
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,607
Then we will begin the episode with Alex Jones giving his take

130
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
On what's going to happen

131
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
And what is happening that day

132
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Naturally

133
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
I want to I want to say something really quick before we go with the Sun

134
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
I am not

135
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
A

136
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Spiceology

137
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
No

138
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
No is that a thing

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,071
But I would guarantee that the planets did not line up

140
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
I don't believe in the movie

141
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
I want to point out that I'm

142
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Triggered by Alex Jones

143
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
I'm doing that voice

144
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,151
Like it's one of the only things that really makes me mad is when he does that freak for

145
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
I had what he says

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Humorous

147
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Those two think that's

148
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,343
Really f****** make me angry as hell you can't add that many

149
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,231
I just too many shouldn't reveal this on-air last Alex Jones start doing those things all the time

150
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
The try to make me mad

151
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,375
But I heard like it's an uncontrollable Ray but I get released

152
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Subaru

153
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
In no way does he

154
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
He like that's such a

155
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
Perfect way to attack us because

156
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
It's Like Only We Know

157
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,407
He's coming at us so he's not giving us any publicity or anything like that

158
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
It's just like a subtle f*** you

159
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Humorous

160
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
Nothing at all the time

161
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Anyway let's see what it says

162
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
Massive coronal ejection from a son

163
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
Table

164
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Comets

165
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,471
Thundarr the Barbarian time destruction

166
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
Play or more globally

167
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,207
There aren't any Mass suicides I hope there aren't any mass killings

168
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
In association with it

169
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
There weren't

170
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,471
Running around 4

171
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495

Oliver top Leatherman different

More.

174
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,551
Massive power outage in Annapolis Market in the world

175
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,695
You were on a respirator in the hospital didn't have a

176

Backup power

177
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,607
The power went off the nuclear reactor meltdown

178
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Everybody there's one

179
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
Good Focus to concerned about those are concerned about

00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383

181
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151

182
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
So what

Taking The High Ground on disaster prediction

185
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
It's going to be the summer of Rage

186
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
What is fine but the mainstream media

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Laughing

188
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,983
Finally talking about how it might be the apocalypse be fair we only know the summer of Rage narratives from 20

189
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
15 we don't know if in 2012 he was doing all that stuff every year

190
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
1999 he was saying that there are secret concentration camps

191
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
In Austin Airport

192
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
Well yeah about Y2K so

193
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Yeah but that was just responsible report

194
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
He's learned an important lesson

195
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Is what I'm getting at

196
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Is that like

197
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
Can't join in with this I know Ted Anderson wants me to sell this f****** gold but I can't do it I got to do it a different way

198
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
I got to try and

199
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,263
An outsider you can't pedal the same narrative

200
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
I don't like CNN was saying

201
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
Media that was saying that the media was recovering weirdos on the internet who were talking about Barack Obama

202
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Had just been reelected in

203
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,743
CNN was like well that's the end then I'm going to take your guns good luck in December

204
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,119
I don't do a good Obama impression that was not great the thing that I really love about that clip

205
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Is that he's like

206
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
This is stupid

207
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,031
To 2012 isn't going to be anything but also

208
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Power goes out

209
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Nuclear

210
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,943
Meltdowns within a week

211
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
And that's when we start dating

212
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
Do you still trying to get some fear in there even with his rejection of the

213
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Frightened fear ideas

214
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
So he has it not

215
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Take us brain

216
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
It's just the end of the calendar

217
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
But if there's a power outage

218
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,911
We all die I think that most of the saying weirdos on the internet we're even pointing that stuff out that it's

219
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Like it's not the end of the world as much

220
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
It is like what is it the Box

221
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
Tune the end of the baktun

222
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
I don't know what that is one of the

223
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
God links

224
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
Sometime in the Mayan

225
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
They just didn't make a next

226
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Your calendar it's like it's like this wall calendar ends in December

227
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Who cares

228
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,415
Alex has a different sort of explanation

229
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
What's really going on though

230
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
Which you might find a little interesting or you might find

231
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Exactly what you would expect Alex does that

232
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
The globalist

233
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
Illuminati Riders

234
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
Special Report on this last week

235
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Title

236
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
2012 doomsday Secrets Revealed

237
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Greyhound

238
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
4 years

239
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Without the shot.

240
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,559
Aquarius show

241
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Who's he is a very important date for the women

242
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
They're big

243
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,967
Quickly on a lot of different fronts are there they are

244
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
Two-way spy system

245
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
And I will come up for you there on Google

246
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah that's what Google is spying on you and then you Google the NS

247
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Alright you bad system if you're the

248
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
So he's already invalidated kind of his argument

249
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
Not the end of the world it's just the beginning of Satan

250
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
The rain

251
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
End of the world

252
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Many of these

253
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,271
Globalist Illuminati writers and pointed out that it's the beginning of Satan

254
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,135
Take a note before we call it the age of Aquarius which as we all know

255
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
From Greek mythology Aquarius

256
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Alex is hurt what song

257
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
I wanted to get some

258
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Singing

259
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
So

260
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
That's sort of where he starts out

261
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
In terms of

262
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Entirety of the

263
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
The Narrative of

264
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
2012

265
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
But right

266
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
It's not a disaster

267
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
But it is a

268
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
And it might be safe

269
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
But not because of the Mayans that's

270
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
The globalist

271
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Say something really bad happened it's the global are we sure the global is haven't been around for 7000

272
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,631
I don't know I mean they are big into child sacrifice so we know a lot of those Mesoamerican societies involve

273
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
Some measure of child sacrifice

274
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Cut the top of a pyramid

275
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,383
Unfortunately Alex doesn't have a lot of time to ruminate on this because he has to do what I would do

276
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Described as a set

277
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
I think this is a sketch

278
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Happening

279
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,063
Somebody's going to jump the Gorge

280
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
He jumps

281
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Something

282
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
It might be reminiscent of a shark

283
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
I'll look this up layout for you

284
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
First off let me show you some 2nd Amendment news here

285
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Again

286
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
Still absolutely off-the-charts

287
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Irani alive Mike

288
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
Alta Mere

289
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
Pennywise plays in the secret service has been there

290
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Warren whatever they want

291
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
The globalist

292
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Are scared right now

293
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
Because they know that you're aware of their problem

294
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,239
So that wasn't what he was saying before but also

295
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,799
I don't believe the Secret Service

296
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:14,175
This is their why would the Secret Service be there unless they were acting in their capacity is

297
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Protectors of the

298
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
Department of Treasury and he's been counterfeit

299
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
It's the beginning of the age of Lucifer they've come to neutralize me before it kicks off

300
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Come on alright

301
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Secret Service

302
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
So I shall seek

303
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,863
One of Alex's big thing of the size of the Secret Service

304
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
An FBI

305
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Come by as Studio before

306
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
Because he's had commenters

307
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Is on his message board

308
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
But if threatened

309
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
To kill the president

310
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
I'm stuff like stupid trolls

311
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
And that f****** FBI's got to come down here and Shake

312
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Me up about it

313
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
That's what that even

314
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
That doesn't make any sense

315
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,879
At all no. Why would the FBI go to Alec

316
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,023
Give up the IP addresses of your commenters like I don't have that address

317
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
Right it's sort of nonsensical but I do believe there's a chance that they may have

318
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Comments on Point Inn

319
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,543
Over something like that because I did you go to Infowars

320
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
The comments

321
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Are not to be believed

322
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
There's a lot of vitriol and anger and threats

323
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Well I guess that is to be

324
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,575
Alright so I could see only people who would come if the FBI showed up

325
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
Zebra like this confirmed

326
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,255
Everything I've ever said I'm a victim

327
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Orgasmic on it

328
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Unbelievable

329
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,215
What are the reasons I don't believe that it is real is because at no point is there

330
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,079
Well there's that it plays out and here's the next clip of

331
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
I'm talking about this

332
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
Being in Infowars studios in occupied text

333
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
Piers Morgan for his attack on the Constitution

334
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Right here

335
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
About whatever the FBI

336
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
Broadcasting live here it's probably over some

337
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
Idiot on a message board or something

338
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Broadcast

339
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Is it

340
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Hey sis are you wanting

341
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
Sad

342
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Wow

343
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,015
You are so natural

344
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
It's always nice to have a visit by the

345
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Brutal boy

346
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
A lot of news to cover obviously here today we're going to break in about 3 minutes

347
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Secret Service

348
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,391
Guys have a camera

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,255
Yeah

350
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Whatever the secret services are for

351
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,823
This is just a number just to go reasons why can't prove they were there

352
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
I forgot

353
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,175
We do have a camera mounted out there

354
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
Yeah what will those when you come back we'll play it

355
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
It's odd dad said that he's going to go try and find this

356
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
Secret Service people while playing a special report

357
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
And what it is is

358
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
The Christmas message from the Federal Reserve

359
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
And it said just died like Jingle Bells kind of music playing in the background and Rob do doing a terrible voice

360
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
It's over where he's like

00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
We are going to take

362
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495

Try a little bit

366
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
I do love a says Mary quantitative

367
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Using

368
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
Alright that's actually pretty solid

369
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
I appreciate merry Kwanzaa

370
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
The idea of

371
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
He's clearly got a sketch

372
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,327
And he's trying to improvise with in Italy

373
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
To do

374
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
What

375
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Like waiting for guffman

376
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
But he is not at all funny and

377
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,287
Any possible way

378
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
No

379
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
Sketch

380
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
At its core is the Secret Service

381
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
But there's no other B

382
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,039
Not know whether there's any plan for like

383
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,415
He's just where do I go service took this

384
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
His car to get her

385
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Centra the Sentra

386
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
It broke down along the way so you don't even know where the Secret Service is well he walked all the way outside the studio

387
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
A help

388
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,031
Of course and we're Infowars and we're like even though you're the Secret Service

389
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,871
We love to help

390
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
Secret service but the other thing too is that with all those like details of we have a camera out there you know

391
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
No we can swivel it around all those details

392
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
All those things are the indications

393
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Alex Jones

394
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Is Classic live

395
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
Whenever you're telling a story and like I said to them

396
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Baba baba

397
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Then I told him to f*** off

398
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,935
I remember an FBI guy coming up and talk to me at a restaur

399
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
Wire that poster of Obama

400
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Andy loser

401
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
So here's where the scene plays at

402
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Itself out and

403
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
No more talk of the Seeker

404
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Service after the

405
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
Trying to do

406
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
We'll just come back with a subpoena

407
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Wouldn't tell us. Basically what it was about

408
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
10 / 4

409
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,032
I'm sure it's going to be a commenter

410
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
I bet money

411
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Infowars.com

412
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
If you go on there and threaten somebody I don't know what it's a

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
About you

414
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
Bright

415
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Plug

416
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:07,104
3 days before it was supposed to come out

417
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,880
The clipboard the rest of it so I'll try to find out what it is

418
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,256
There is no b**** that you're the best

419
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,240
But he was a little match

420
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
No I want to talk to Alex

421
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,688
He's even sort of rewriting what happened to the last clip

422
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
I do

423
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
Sleep last night from A Christmas party are sticking up

424
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Pics of the FBI diet

425
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,584
Knockin on the door

426
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
For whatever it's about

427
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
All right enough

428
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
How do you think they don't know

429
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:14,432
Beer on air schedule

430
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
I think they could

431
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
I think that can figure out what time the show

432
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Where did they get the

433
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
The timezone wrong

434
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
Eastern Time

435
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Sometime sorry

436
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,608
Bi-Lo plan for this s***

437
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,936
Also I like the idea that they were just

438
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Come with us

439
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,056
Subpoena

440
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,896
So if he doesn't grab them then we still can't do anything

441
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah that's just dumb left it all in because it

442
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
It's really fun

443
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,064
To see him struggle with trying to make something

444
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
I off air be real

445
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,952
Funny I think he's trying to be manly

446
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Like I don't give a fuk

447
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Secret Service

448
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Stare me

449
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
I'm great

450
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
I think that's more of what

451
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
What is your little

452
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
Secretive stuff

453
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,032
Reserve people in secret

454
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Need the address

455
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
Which is why we know everything about

456
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Well-documented

457
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,944
So after this Alex Jones

458
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Gets a little bit freaked out and

459
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
Discusses Muslim women show up in his coffee

460
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
Did not not yet

461
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
At this point

462
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
In history

463
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,000
Cuz it was not the hot countercultural narrative

464
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
In 2012

465
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
I guess

466
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
I guess they did still hate immigrants

467
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,936
But they were just they had more important things to deal with

468
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
Which is Alex Jones fearing about his own mortality

469
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
FEMA camper whatever

470
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
I know that

471
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:59,136
The following with your little love GPS TracFone

472
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
I just get the go-ahead

473
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,872
What's the weather outside

474
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:36,000
Sofa actually f****** today today the idea that he's

475
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
He's f******

476
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
Pulling this high horse b******* about how

477
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,168
Police brutality is an issue today

478
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
A motherfuker got

479
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Off

480
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Yeah it was like luminar whatever

481
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,080
And it's f****** unreal

482
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Yeah but the cops are beat

483
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,248
Finish it out of people protesters no worries narratives

484
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
You sure sure that's terrible

485
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,648
Alex and I'm assuming that Alex is going to keep his ideological

486
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:10,048
Consistency and say police are overreaching and they are murdering people because he's black lives matter what skin color

487
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,608
Are they are working for Soros

488
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
It's just cultural education and everybody who's White

489
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
As a real grievance and people who are black are just you know trying to

490
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,592
Create racial division

491
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,176
I was interested in what he was talking about in that clip

492
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
If you can talk about the

493
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Carne killing in

494
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
As I looked into it I tried to Google

495
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,392
Carney killing that Carney guy is what he said

496
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,440
That's why I tried to Google it and

497
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,488
I can't like I tried so many different

498
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Spellings of Kearney

499
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Man like

500
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
I want I could find

501
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
I found a load of weird feel like there's only one spelling

502
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Carnival

503
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Carney

504
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,752
I was going to go I

505
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Now

506
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
I found this story and this is from

507
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
City outside of San Antonio

508
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,016
A man is dead after police say he attempted to break into a northeast side home Friday afternoon

509
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
It happened on this

510
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
6300 block of Aspen

511
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Open Farm Justice

512
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,952
2 p.m. police say a man tried to get into home through window

513
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,744
But a woman Inside met the alleged

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
Intruder and shot him

515
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,096
The alleged Intruder later identified as 39 year-old James

516
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,400
Kearney of New Braunfels

517
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Died at a hospital

518
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,728
Police say Kearney left

519
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
The seven-year-old kid in the car during the attempted break-in

520
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Oh well that's his real crime

521
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
So there's one

522
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
The car need killing

523
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,504
Window

524
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
So the other one is a really

525
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
I think it has

526
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Has to be what he's talking about

527
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
But I don't

528
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
Think it

529
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Works

530
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,464
For what he saying

531
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:48,864
There was a few that doesn't make any goddamn sense well there was a 1991 there was a mass

532
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Massacre that happened

533
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Interesting Lee

534
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
At a Luby's

535
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:58,848
Which we know is Alex Jones favorite.

536
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,736
Trouble and he always helps they want money or they don't have money to pay their their food

537
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
The greatest human being

538
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah so what happened was her old white ladies there's a guy named George hennard

539
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
He drove his pickup truck with nothing

540
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,512
He drove his pickup truck through the front window of the Luby's

541
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
And immediately shot

542
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
Man killed 23 people and wounded 20

543
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,912
27 others before fatally shooting himself

544
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,240
It's the fourth deadliest Massacre by single shooter in u.s.

545
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,384
Wow so the reason that this came up when I was looking into Carney killings is one of the people who he killed

546
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Was named Patricia Kearney

547
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,064
So that is a connection to a Carne killing re-send in

548
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Whatever

549
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
I don't think that Alex wants this to

550
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
To be the one though because

551
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,256
It was it was very clearly a violent

552
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,048
Massacre again

553
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Text women

554
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah he intentionally for those are those are very unusual

555
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
New never see those numerous reports included the council

556
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
Menards

557
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
Hatred of women

558
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
The next roommate of his said he hated blacks

559
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
Hispanics gay

560
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
He said women were snakes

561
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
And always a derogatory remarks about them

562
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,456
Especially after fights

563
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
His mother

564
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Passover

565
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
He passed over men to shoot women

566
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
14 of the 23 people killed were women

567
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
As were many of the wounded

568
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,512
He called two of them a bit

569
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Before shooting

570
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,376
So that could have been the card I can't find

571
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
News story that matches up with what

572
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
He is actually describing

573
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,872
But those are a couple of Kearney related murders that have happened in

574
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
Guy who runs the world

00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
Sick of it

Tilt-A-Whirl just spin so fast everybody turns

578
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,608
Jelly you never operate

579
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,448
You know you never really hear about that out they ran away

580
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
You would think though that that's got to be a pro

581
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
Herbalife

582
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800

No sex

597
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320

Is that what he

602
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,264
There's a typo right there this is like Tom Drudge

603
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
So

604
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,432
Did the the thing that he thinks is a typo I'm glad that I'm glad that he has some copyediting

605
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
Scales

606
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:21,856
It was not a typo State of the State address is a real thing for Governors to do

607
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,488
Tibia state-of-the-union or something like that a mistake

608
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,048
That would be okay

609
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,888
If you just on-air flub didn't realize that it was a real thing but listen to this

610
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
That right there

611
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
6 a.m. this morning whenever

612
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Just got caught doing other things

613
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,920
New York Times

00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Article

615
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
There's better ways to do things

616
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,624
You know because we're free things at any point

617
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
Also sick ramshackle

618
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,208
Bulshit that he has

619
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Like a supposedly has

620
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Millions upon millions of viewers

621
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
But it's still like

622
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,400
What will do to look you misspelled

623
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,728
There is no bee Hornet live

624
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,544
I mean it's a bad process

625
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Play button

626
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
At the same time

627
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,408
Are you finding an error that isn't an error

628
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Yeah I saw the zits

629
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
This morning I meant

630
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
Had to tell him about it

631
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,808
Hateful eight on drugs

632
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,440
This is for real like the s*** Jerome corsi right

633
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Because you're

634
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:37,120
Too accurate spelling you on the ball this is on drugs baby

635
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
So

636
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
We're about to get to the the Lions

637
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
The bulk

638
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
Okay of the episode what goes on on

639
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
December twenty

640
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
2012

641
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
December 12th

642
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
December 21st December 21st 12 12 12

643
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,016
2112

644
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
So is mine the really bad a calendar

645
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,416
12 12 12

646
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:06,816
That's what makes perfect level with our white people calendar

647
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
Isn't that our calendar based on an Arabic

648
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Is a Gregorian

649
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,240
Darien based only from the Arabs

650
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,336
I don't know we sold everything just trying to save face at this point

651
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
So

652
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
After this point most of the episode is not really had all that much to do with 2012 with that Alexei that it's really just

653
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
The globalist

654
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Secret Service

655
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Secret Service heavy up

656
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,392
Episode yeah there's a lot of just stuff

657
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
The could have been on any episode at all

658
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
But now we get to

659
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
What Alex

660
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Going to spend at least an

661
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Hour-and-a-half

662
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
After this show on

663
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
And that is

664
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
An interview 911

665
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
An interview with David Icke

666
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
No

667
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
Alien overlord David Icke

668
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Wow

669
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,176
Just for fun I want to read you a couple quotes

670
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
From David Icke before we get into his interview

671
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Just so you can have a good sense of the man

672
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,576
If you don't know who he is

673
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,160
He is a guy who believe that there are lizard people

674
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,976
That have invaded the elite levels of

675
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,792
Society and they're trying to

676
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,864
All the globalist stuff that Alex believes just make them lizards

677
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
And it's David Icke

678
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
CK revealed Dick Cheney

679
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,520
Where was it done run

680
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,592
Rumsfeld

681
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,896
Ratman Lucy Kay wasn't serious

682
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:26,944
Was he

683
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,040
We super want to hear a couple quotes that should give you some

684
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,600
Pause about about David Icke

685
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Inula and the very late 1800's a controversial document came to light called the protocols of the Elders of Zion

686
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,840
I call them the Illuminati protocols and I quote many extract

687
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
From them in the robots Rebellion

688
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,984
At the robot that's a book that he wrote

689
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Yes

690
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Big time

691
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
You can take from that and other quote cities may he totally believes the protocols are real

692
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Sand just like

693
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
It's not about Jews their lizards

694
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,808
Everybody hates Jews insist it's not about you

695
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
Right globalists David Icke doesn't says there lizard people it's all just the same thing

696
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
God I just read errors does Raptors

697
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
Right now it's

698
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,400
Again he's evil which means the Raptor

699
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
Is it too complicated

700
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,592
This is going to dovetail slightly into basically Project Camelot territory

701
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:32,992
As we get through this out it'll be a little less painful as that but the whole scenario is play

702
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
Playing centuries ago because the reptilian

703
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
Operating from the lower fourth to my

704
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
Indeed

705
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
Whatever for

706
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Controls them

707
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
Has most of the upper fourth

708
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,256
4th Dimension has tears

709
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
Do not know the fourth dimension

710
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
Nearest dump

711
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:53,472
You're very dumb dumb alright so the reptilians have a very different version of time than we have

712
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,336
Okay they can see in plan down the three-dimensional timeline in a way that those in

713
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Three-dimensional form

714
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,664
Cannot like the movie arrival

715
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,712
Yeah we got so he has a lot of

716
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,296
That's kind of fun he is actually going to end up quoting a lot of movies

717
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
So here we go here's the

718
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
Alex Jones bringing David Icke

719
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Into the program

720
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Aaron

721
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
Explaining what

722
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,560
What David Icke steak on 2012

723
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
They can accelerate your enslavement

724
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
Which I approved because

725
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
So but they're there we can just pause for a second absolutely not

726
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,304
Every study of which Congress does not allow

727
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,120
No cuz the NRA has lobbied them to make it

728
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Illegal

729
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
To study the results of gun can

730
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
Control laws

731
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Proves

732
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
That crime is

733
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,896
But even so that's that's not what he's saying crime has gone down to

734
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Write with these stay when you take

735
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
The guns away

736
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
As opposed to

737
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,344
When the guns go he's making a classical fallacy of confusing correlation and causation

738
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
The saying people have more guns now which is true

739
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,464
And crime has gone down

740
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
He's saying that the gun that have caused

741
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
The crimes go down

742
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
And of course there was that we every reference that study out of Stanford

743
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
They came out a couple months ago that showed

744
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
The places that have rights

745
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Carry laws

746
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Show 13

747
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Percent increase

748
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Recent violent crime

749
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
So

750
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:37,152
Studies that actually look at the real thing

751
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Say that is not true

752
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
But Alex

753
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Being able to like

754
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
A

755
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Be

756
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
But I must be insane

757
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
But doesn't always

758
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Get to David Icke baby

759
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
Not true

760
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
Mobile number

761
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,168
Twisted his arm to come on we

762
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,312
Little Rock

763
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,296
The world

764
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
Globalist push this

765
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,440
Is the launch of their luciferian error

766
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,496
2015 2016 41

767
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
That's

768
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Currently may be true

769
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
2015 so if they are the globalist then

770
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,184
Or whatever like the prophecy might be if David Icke thinks

771
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
2015 2016 that's what she's going to go down like

772
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,096
You might have nailed that one happy fun if he was also like it's

773
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:06,496
The Russian Putin is going to compromise you Alex what you need to do is get out now

774
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,080
We'll get to equip here in a little bit that actually indicates

775
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Animated Alex

776
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Is already compromised

777
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Okay

778
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
I'm not sure but I think

779
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
You might already have very pro-russian

780
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,272
In 2012

781
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
Our investigation into

782
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
That stuff is going to be

783
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Impossibly long

784
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,232
I don't know how we'll ever pull that off but

785
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
So here we go Alex's

786
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Who introduced the David Icke

787
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
Doesn't believe 2012 is legit 20

788
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
15 is looking

789
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
I like how he says over a decade ago

790
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
As if

791
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,288
Everybody a decade ago believed it but

792
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,408
I'm 2002 evraz like dude we've only got ten years left

793
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,944
Mayan calendar that makes

794
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
Perfect sense

795
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,504
I believe everything

796
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
And David Icke

797
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
No

798
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
I am

799
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,368
Truth-teller

800
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Yeah exactly

801
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
The here's David Icke

802
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Introduction into

803
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
The Fray

804
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
Well I just think it with heading Alex to a point in the New Year in 2013

805
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
When somebody sings going to come together

806
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,688
Fan of his Warriors have to win

807
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
We have space

808
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Fiscal

809
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,832
Clippers are talking about

810
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
Obvious agenda

811
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
2

812
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
Porsche on down the road

813
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
If people saw that movie that was

814
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,912
Rescue people absolutely staggeringly rich

815
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
NAU

816
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
Hi-Tech

817
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,824
Top-of-the-range luxury capital

818
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,664
But certainly that's the only movie that's ever had that sort of thing

819
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,456
You certainly that isn't something that exists

820
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
Lots of Science Fiction throughout time

821
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
It's really strange that he would

822
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,416
Choose an allegorical movie in order to illustrate his point

823
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
There's another reason he chose

824
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
Nocatee Love Jennifer

825
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
It's not good

826
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Pretty great it's not a good read

827
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
It's not a good movie

828
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
And the rest of the people

829
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
Feeding that wealth

830
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,056
We're actually in abject poverty and under

831
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,616
Beyond orwellian levels of control

832
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,504
Interesting to me because symbolism a lot and

833
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
Soco coincidence

834
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,136
Should be

835
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Enum

836
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,024
Living in the area of Sandy Hook signed with the connections from that into the

837
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,424
Dark knight rising movie when abilities

838
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,472
They mailed out to the media

839
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
Attack papers

840
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
The shooter of Reagan

841
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
Really deeper into this really deep into this Alex it's all about the manipulation of the humans

842
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,999
Subconscious mind

843
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
So

844
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,607
So so not only is Sandy Hook

845
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
A hoax

846
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,983
Right but they like is onboard Ground Zero for

847
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Every

848
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Plan that the globalist

849
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,823
Have ever had because it was named

850
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Glee before

851
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,199
Well it's bad guy certainly it's wagging their dick around base

852
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,111
So that is a very popular narrative with

853
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Sandy Hook truthers

854
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,511
Now the idea that if you do watch Batman there is Sandy Hook written on a map

855
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
In the in the movie

856
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,119
Really that's weird

857
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
But

858
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,167
It's not that weird

859
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
Because the prop Mass

860
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Of the movie

861
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
Is from Newtown Connecticut

862
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
Okay

863
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
So there's a decent chance

864
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,151
You just wrote Sandy Hook on it because it's his hometown

865
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,223
Yeah that's like if I were a prop master I might write

866
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
Or something like that

867
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
Brad dropped out of high school baby

868
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
No I wouldn't

869
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
And I hated that

870
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
How do I

871
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
Village not that it's not that crazy

872
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
It is crazy that there ended up being a shooting in the prop Masters Hometown but that is what we call clinic

873
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Now

874
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
Predictive programming

875
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Unfortunately

876
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
A little bit down the road what they're trying to do is

877
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Manipulate

878
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,383
Well here here hear me out on this

879
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,967
A little bit after the movie came out

880
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
The prop master

881
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,343
Whose name is like Scott Grabowski or something like that house key

882
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
He died

883
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,975
If he had a kilt

884
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
He must have

885
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
Timeline doesn't match up

886
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
He got killed

887
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,263
He was in a car accident where a 18 year old driver jumped the median and hit him head-on

888
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
And he died

889
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,847
Yeah that's very sad but it also

890
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
To mine eyes seems like a

891
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,431
Project winter

892
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
However

893
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
Our friend John Rappaport

894
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
F****** no more fake news. Calm about how this proper

895
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,487
Master put Sandy Hook into the movie

896
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:21,375
To tell the public about globalist plans that he had uncovered and then he was murdered

897
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,215
In this car accident to silence him from telling anything else

898
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,823
Reasonable support his plan

899
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,127
To warn us of the globalist

900
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
Yes

901
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,455
You put the smallest thing

902
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
On a newspaper

903
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,039
That you are not paying attention

904
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,367
In order to warn everybody a mapping in the movie

905
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
What do you mean newspaper

906
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
Whatever

907
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
The point being

908
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
That is a bad

909
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,279
It's not great

910
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
It's not a great plan

911
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
I just would like to point out the John rapaport's website is called No More

912
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,703
Dot-com

913
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
It's

914
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,543
It's not called no more bad theories

915
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Dot-com

916
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,223
Play so that's fair I guess but a pre-emptive go f*** yourself John Ross Park coming in this episode

917
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Yeah you would have to

918
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
Have news

919
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
In order for it to be

920
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,695
Maybe fate will the news he is just making s*** up here what the news is that they prop Master died

921
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
Yeah and he's faking the news

922
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,791
Of why he died

923
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,327
It just has a conjecture

924
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Of why he died it was still reporting

925
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
That

926
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,263
Young people are generally more irresponsible drivers

927
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
They are more prone to act

928
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
These things happen

929
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,151
When it's sad but it's not

930
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Not a globalist

931
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Murder though

932
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,039
From everything I can tell

933
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Stupid

934
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,111
Bringing that stuff up as is Alex Jones

935
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
All this stuff is a

936
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
Crocodiles

937
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,975
And it's it's disappointing to me

938
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,767
Lakers are you

939
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,815
Appointed whenever you get into

940
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
To like one of these guys

941
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
I don't hate David Icke

942
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,935
As much as I hate Alex Jones

943
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,519
Because at least David Icke talks about some stuff that I'm like

944
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
I'm into

945
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,103
Like talkin about the hypnotic effect

946
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
So television

947
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,687
And stuff like that there are good messages that

948
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
They can come from some of the stuff even if you saying

949
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
That these

950
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,623
Definitely not Jewish reptilian lizards are trying to hypnotize you through television

951
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,463
I don't buy that but I Do by the negative effects of watching

952
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Too much TV

953
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Play too many video games

954
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
That sort of thing

955
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
It can be a negative info

956
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Not always

957
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
Bring up that that's worth of stuff

958
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
I'm into it

959
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,263
And when I hear someone like him that I'm like

960
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
I don't hate you

961
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
And then they're like Sandy Hook a totally fake

962
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
I liked it just drives

963
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Insane house

964
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
Eyes are so close

965
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
Figuring out

966
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Why we need socialist

967
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,599
Like they're so close to it they're like

968
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,391
Too much inequality there's a

969
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
The small group

970
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
People who have all the money

971
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
There's a larger

972
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
People who have no money

973
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
Serps

974
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
So maybe

975
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Do a little bit of

976
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
Reading into

977
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
When that

978
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
For and how peep

979
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
People f****** got out of

980
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
But instead of

981
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:12,383
It's just like the word socialism is bad socialism

982
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,199
F****** insane you're almost there

983
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
Dead

984
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
Will make it

985
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,295
Totally

986
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,623
It's because of the idea of the prod problem reaction

987
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:27,999
Solution the hegelian dialect narrative that they have in their head which is they believe that

988
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
The

989
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
The inequality and the Have Nots

990
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,119
Stop being so that their suffering so much and

991
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
Society

992
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Is the problem

993
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Then the globalist

994
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,727
Come in with socialism which is the

995
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,055
Solution that they have pre-made for people

996
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:44,895
Steak and then they're like all we loved it we will take this illusion

997
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Tyranny

998
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
Socialism leads to the tyranny

999
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
That just doesn't make

1000
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,855
Any sense if they're globulus they already own every

1001
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Right so they're going to

1002
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,159
Cause

1003
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,695
That issue

1004
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Bringing socialism

1005
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Wherein they won't

1006
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Oh never

1007
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Tyranny

1008
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Where they will own

1009
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
On everything

1010
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,983
It's it's it's sort of like it seems like

1011
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
But it seems like they're more just bored like can we pull this off work we're trillionaires who gives a s*** let's give it a shot

1012
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
Exactly yeah

1013
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Style points are important

1014
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,807
It's part of Electro Magic

1015
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
So in this next clip Alex Jones talks

1016
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
A bit about some

1017
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Scripture

1018
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,255
I'm out on the other side of it I have some iffy news

1019
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Important

1020
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,631
Expand their Horizons

1021
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
To expand their awareness of what's going on this universe

1022
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
Artificial boxer Matrix

1023
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Work together

1024
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,919
I am. Not to be divided

1025
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,479
And that's why it's so important

1026
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,039
That we support the work today but I could doing because

1027
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Mandachord

1028
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
Christ was quoted as saying

1029
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,719
By its fruits

1030
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
So I don't like you I don't like Spanish

1031
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
To me the fruit

1032
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Roots of David Ike's work

1033
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,191
Sort of veiled anti-semitism

1034
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
Certainly I don't like the phrasing of like

1035
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
Christ was quoted

1036
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,151
I just don't like to interview Coronavirus

1037
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,479
Undertaker guns so the other problem with this

1038
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:27,039
Is I'm going to go to the doc cam here

1039
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
David Icke in the past

1040
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Has I said this

1041
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Depress

1042
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,799
It interview David Icke has literally said that

1043
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
He is Christ

1044
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
That be all right

1045
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
And then whatever gets asked a direct question

1046
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,199
Then he starts dissembling like

1047
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,527
The thing is right you talked about the godhead

1048
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,343
And I also in that interview if you want to watch that

1049
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
It's pretty wild stuff

1050
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,903
He goes into talking about like

1051
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,231
The color turquoise resonates with wisdom so if you wear it

1052
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,279
It attracts wisdom to you

1053
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
If you wear black

1054
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
Guess you hate

1055
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
Eventbee got the guy was doing interviews like

1056
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,191
That's bad news for four months

1057
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,543
And that everyone laughs is that guy you know

1058
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
The great thing is

1059
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,639
Great thing is laughter laughter is so great

1060
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,431
It's a great way to break through conditioning and

1061
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Advocate interview his like

1062
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
You understand They're laughing

1063
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Accu

1064
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
It's a brutal brutal f****** interview

1065
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,183
But David Icke headset kids

1066
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
The son of God

1067
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,279
Which I would imagine Alex Jones would not be

1068
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Well I'm

1069
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
His work proved

1070
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
That he is

1071
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Yeah

1072
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
So you judging you judge the Son of God by

1073
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,031
The fruits of his

1074
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
Is fruits are a peach but seriously

1075
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,871
Has he done anything

1076
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Like.

1077
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
He's giving a lot of speeches

1078
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
What do you want

1079
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:06,111
If you're going to come with us the fruits of his work bulshit then there has to

1080
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
To be work

1081
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
And then

1082
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,487
Freaks well I guess so fruit if he's just done work

1083
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
And it's been

1084
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
Speeches where he's gotten

1085
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
Unpaid

1086
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
There's not really any

1087
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:21,215
Fruit that I'm guessing the way it would be conceptualized as that he's woken up a lot of people's bringing awareness

1088
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:25,567
Right he's Eastern people on to the globalist even if you thinks with their reptilian

1089
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
Lizards some people are heroes

1090
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Bring awareness

1091
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Breast cancer

1092
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
Lizardman Lizardman

1093
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
And that's where he's on

1094
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,599
So Alex asked David Icke

1095
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
You know good

1096
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Evil

1097
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Lizards

1098
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
How's it going for these Elites

1099
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
How are things for the globalist

1100
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,591
Read my books in the in the end

1101
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,199
That they'll see a lot of backgrounds to the fact

1102
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
This

1103
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
Pools

1104
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Which

1105
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
Is Manifest in our reality through these Bloodlines and you know these into breathing so cold

1106
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Elite Bloodlines and Families

1107
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
We do not depend upon them

1108
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
Depend upon us

1109
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:26,751
It's the relationship between humans and

1110
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
The parasite

1111
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:32,127
216 Parasite Eve off the parasite to The Host

1112
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,175
Humanity is the host

1113
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
These all the parasites so how is it going

1114
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,391
Greater than we ever imagined currently

1115
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,463
Without the parasite but it can exist without us

1116
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,743
I'm so

1117
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,279
Energy

1118
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
Which

1119
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
Is the parasites

1120
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
Lifeforce if you like

1121
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
Is low vibrational human emotion all emotions around fear and hatred conflict

1122
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
Warriors Terra

1123
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:09,247
Manipulation and construct a global Society

1124
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
To create situations that

1125
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,879
Constantly generate those energies soap

1126
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
You can look at Sandy Hook

1127
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,255
So that ended poorly

1128
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
Is it going for

1129
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
Going gray

1130
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
He spent

1131
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
A lot of words

1132
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Saying nothing nothing and then answered

1133
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
No question at the same time I think there is there's a version of what he's saying that if you want to look at it

1134
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
Artfully

1135
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
And metaphorically

1136
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
He's saying something good if you want to look at it

1137
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
Well if you take the

1138
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,527
Sandy Hook part out of the end of eclipse

1139
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
It just leave that alone

1140
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,671
Just ignore ignore that he said that at all

1141
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,743
But if you just take that he saying

1142
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,863
The way you saying it is there these lizard reptilian Elites

1143
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
Who feed off negative energy

1144
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,751
And that could be construed as a metaphorical way of

1145
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Expressing

1146
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
That these

1147
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,591
Oppressive government forces

1148
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
And people who wish to Duell

1149
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
Know that in negative Circle

1150
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,223
Santa's they can get away with a lot more

1151
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
If you are attacked

1152
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,039
It's easier to

1153
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Get your

1154
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:22,207
Military-industrial complex going and make money off War that's shows that is what he's saying he's doing

1155
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
A terrible job

1156
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Saying it

1157
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,303
But at the same time it's like he is right

1158
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Wow it is

1159
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
It is the global

1160
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
I don't think he's saying that

1161
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Kia Kia

1162
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,263
No no

1163
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,103
You spelled it out clearly saying they literally feed off negative energy

1164
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Do you like Mike we eat food

1165
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:44,479
Yeah but he means literally in the way that everybody uses it

1166
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Which is to say

1167
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Bright

1168
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
Alright so

1169
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,903
You might have noticed that he is literally always telling the

1170
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Literally

1171
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,023
Haha at the end of that clip you mentioned Sandy Hook you may recall

1172
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
Any does Sabor in this next

1173
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,887
You can look at Sandy Hook

1174
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
You can

1175
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
Oh yes

1176
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,055
It's about

1177
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,407
An excuse to take guns away because of the same reason that they

1178
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Does dr.

1179
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:21,087
Guns and ammunition being owned by Jewish people

1180
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,439
Copycat

1181
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
Conditioning

1182
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,607
Yeah it was

1183
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Another one is

1184
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
To to create

1185
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
What

1186
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:37,983
Emotional trauma

1187
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
Collectively in the population

1188
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,103
Adjusting America of Sandy Hook

1189
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,711
Much greater that because

1190
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,807
So that's where talk about psychic vampires

1191
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
David Icke

1192
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,439
Am I supposed to David I can listen

1193
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
I can't I can't do this

1194
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
I can't do a British accent

1195
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
That sounds like

1196
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,583
Tired

1197
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,399
This is also a really like

1198
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,823
Good call good call we're going to start we're going to scratch that we're just never going to do that again

1199
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,383
So

1200
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,455
I again think that he's trying to express something else

1201
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
But doing it through this

1202
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Paradigm of

1203
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Of lizards

1204
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Globalist

1205
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
What have you

1206
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
And that is but it really

1207
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,951
The idea that these events happen

1208
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Every contextualize it in

1209
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
In terms of an evil force

1210
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
Faking it or making these thing

1211
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,607
Things happen in order to

1212
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Get their evil food

1213
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,215
It's easier to wrestle with that

1214
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
Then it is to wrestle with

1215
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
The fact that other humans

1216
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Might bring guns

1217
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,103
The school and kill chill

1218
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,151
Because they're that

1219
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,735
I disconnected their that abused than that

1220
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,295
In pain themselves

1221
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:01,951
It's much harder to look at humanity and see it for what it is then to it is to make up narratives about

1222
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
Space lizards

1223
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
It's base lizard

1224
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
And they have to do these things

1225
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,863
In order to get their food and they could only eat

1226
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
We all feel terrible thing

1227
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,727
So they create Mass trauma events like this

1228
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
So that they can

1229
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,823
Can feed off a track

1230
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
Denial wherein

1231
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
If you create

1232
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
This

1233
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
False reality of

1234
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
The enemy is

1235
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:24,991
Using this

1236
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
As a

1237
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
As a false

1238
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
Swag in the same way that he

1239
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,879
Thanks that you know Sandy Hook is a false

1240
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Aflac in order to get

1241
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Carbon tax

1242
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,183
Right

1243
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
To wrestle with

1244
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
The fact that

1245
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Humanity has killed it so

1246
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,559
Yeah and that's something that

1247
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,119
You know if you would actively participate

1248
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Your denial only has

1249
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Stronger

1250
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Otherwise

1251
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
You're going to have a day

1252
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,055
Where you just sit down and all the sudden it

1253
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
To you and your like

1254
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Everything I have done

1255
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Has

1256
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
Wound up hurting

1257
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,551
As you pointed out it as a clip was playing like that wasn't the first school she

1258
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:04,927
And the other thing about like when you talk about climate change that relates to this is

1259
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,743
When Sandy Hook happened it we didn't

1260
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,791
Not know that could happen

1261
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,863
Like it didn't happen before and one of the things with x

1262
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Painful about it is

1263
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,191
On some level we had warning

1264
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,775
Oh absolutely shootings happened and they happened a bunch

1265
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
And we should know that these things are

1266
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
Are going to happen unless we

1267
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
We've behaved if

1268
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,455
And with climate change the same thing

1269
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
We know we have warning

1270
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,807
And when things go as bad as they

1271
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,831
Probably will

1272
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,623
Will have to wrestle with the fact that like

1273
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
We know we knew we were doing

1274
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Star signs

1275
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Sucking is

1276
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
Much money out of

1277
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:49,215
They got to believe that they're armored redoubt so I think it's more like they have to have had this idea from from the researcher

1278
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,519
Well the worst effects won't be till 2

1279
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
40

1280
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
Well I'll be f******

1281
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,359
What do I give a s***

1282
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
Like that's one of the big issue

1283
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
Shoes that I have with all of these people

1284
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
Is there

1285
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,527
Not killing themselves

1286
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
They're killing us

1287
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
It's so f******

1288
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Frustrating

1289
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,183
I mean if you do

1290
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,207
Just want to engage

1291
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,231
With that dumbass

1292
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
What is narrative

1293
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
There

1294
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,303
Using

1295
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Trauma today

1296
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Psychic

1297
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Fear vampire bulge

1298
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Yeah

1299
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Don't they know

1300
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
How

1301
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
F******

1302
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Numb

1303
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,055
We've become

1304
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
To school shooting

1305
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
Like I remember

1306
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,895
Sandy Hook happen

1307
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
I remember being

1308
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
So angry but it's

1309
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
The same time

1310
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
Just resigned like

1311
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,855
We didn't do anything after the last shooting we're not going to do anything after the shooting

1312
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
So there will be another

1313
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
How do I

1314
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
How can I process

1315
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Best ramen

1316
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,047
Now when it is only foreshadowing for more

1317
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Perfect

1318
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:52,959
That's exactly what the globalist

1319
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
Right

1320
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
F****** insane

1321
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
You know what else

1322
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
Isn't saying I want to take your

1323
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
I don't have any

1324
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,663
Okay can I have them I don't have any

1325
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
Anyway it wasn't as the guy who can

1326
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,783
So in this next clip

1327
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
Alex Jones reveal

1328
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
I think

1329
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
I think

1330
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
Alex Jones believes

1331
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Vudu

1332
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,863
Thousand years old 500 years old

1333
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,959
Jewish mysticism

1334
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,871
If you do a model of somebody when you stab

1335
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
And it makes them actually get hurt

1336
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
Weather is real or not

1337
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
Stop

1338
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
I don't believe in stuff like

1339
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
Bitter

1340
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:46,719
Something spiritual

1341
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,303
Do they know 60

1342
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,887
Earthquake

1343
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:59,007
They have these cells in our brains a pickup magnetic information

1344
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,359
Follow these magnetic

1345
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
So Alex believes in voodoo

1346
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,207
1 Apollo Huawei that you start clips

1347
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,511
Would just as random non-sequitur like

1348
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,071
All the things that I was expecting

1349
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
To hear the first words being

1350
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Anton LaVey

1351
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,495
Was not one of those

1352
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:37,919
I'd of course it's not the doll doing it

1353
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:42,015
Don't paint me with that brush

1354
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
The spirits that inhabit it are

1355
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
Yeah

1356
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:51,231
So leaving all that other stuff aside the ley-lines and when have you had something we can

1357
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,047
Discuss out of paranormal casting at some point

1358
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,655
But Alex Jones

1359
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
Let's see what David Icke thinks

1360
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,175
Sorry sorry

1361
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
Wendy

1362
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,783
Create a hologram

1363
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,831
In a studio

1364
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,951
The information that creates the apparent imaginal phone

1365
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
Is iPhone

1366
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,583
And when you look at it looks like a fingerprint is just wavy lines

1367
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:32,703
But you fire a laser at the wavy lines and suddenly and apparently the best of them anyway

1368
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,263
Apparently

1369
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:42,175
Breakfast in front of you and you know we seeing all the graphics is being used more and more in stage shows

1370
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,503
End conversation all this stuff

1371
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,295
Television

1372
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
If you can get

1373
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,463
To the waveform level of everything

1374
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:02,911
Holographic projection

1375
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,239
He's focusing.

1376
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
Anyting

1377
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
Slavery is simply

1378
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,127
A focus on

1379
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
Attention

1380
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,967
Represents the target

1381
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,831
Like a wand

1382
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,159
Focusing attention on the electrical magnetic field of the dolls

1383
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,975
You can connect that

1384
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,303
Frequency wise vibrational wise

1385
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
1

1386
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:40,287
Then gets transferred

1387
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,847
To the Target through the electromagnetic

1388
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
When it's a reality but those behind those behind those that we see as obvious

1389
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:59,231
Orchestrations of Mustafa still on Suzanne's in Pinole rides if you can actually see them

1390
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,583
So he does believe in voodoo

1391
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Percent

1392
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
Fix the elite

1393
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
There's always

1394
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,775
Always super duper relates always now a pseudo-scientific

1395
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,591
Justification for Magic

1396
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
Like that's the funny thing about science

1397
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,711
Especially with

1398
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
C Clarke's quote you know

1399
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,271
No enemies sufficient

1400
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
Matter that can

1401
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
But these guys just

1402
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
Makeup set

1403
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Bulshit like

1404
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
A magnetic

1405
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
Field do they

1406
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,535
Could they sit down and

1407
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:38,655
Explain what a magnetic field is outside of any kind of magic just like

1408
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,239
What is a magnetic field

1409
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,031
He could talk for a long time

1410
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
Frankly I'm asking

1411
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Now if you can

1412
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
No

1413
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
Certainly not a little bit of prep

1414
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,967
Okay but what I can tell you is a little bit about David I can pass

1415
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:57,343
He used to be a soccer player I believe he'd know you was pretty musica famous

1416
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Announcer

1417
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,951
After he played soccer for a bit in England then became an announcer

1418
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,999
And then I went nuts

1419
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
A little bit

1420
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,863
He I listen to a long interview with him on Project Camelot

1421
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,423
He does it to our interview with Kerry Cassidy

1422
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,775
Great where he explains that he went to like a jungle or something like that

1423
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
And he was on a Mountaintop

1424
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,895
And all of a sudden he went into Christ pose

1425
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
He had his arms

1426
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Extended

1427
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
That he couldn't move his arms

1428
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,015
Said he heard a voice that told him

1429
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
You will stay like this until the rain come

1430
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,391
He could see way off in the distance

1431
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
Rain cloud

1432
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,463
He's like that's really far away

1433
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
He was there for like hours

1434
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Okay the Christ pose

1435
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,375
Who is downloading information

1436
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
Like some entity was talking to him and

1437
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:48,031
Explaining everything to him catch Atlanta soon as the rain came and washed over him

1438
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,103
He came back to his senses and his arms came down

1439
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
He was in a lot of pain cuz

1440
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
Is doing this for a long time hurts

1441
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,199
Wright hot

1442
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
And

1443
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
So that's

1444
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,039
When people started talking

1445
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,367
What other voices started creeping into his head after the

1446
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,951
This transformative experience more characters that we wind up meeting on

1447
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,231
On the show The More

1448
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
Become a game for me

1449
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,303
Need to be like okay

1450
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Is this

1451
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Pure mental

1452
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Conning

1453
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
Is this a mixture of

1454
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:20,287
The two like who's who's where and with David Icke you're like

1455
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
Oh you just haven't

1456
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,127
I know he's not trying to screw anybody

1457
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:26,431
But he is trying to make money though

1458
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
Yeah but I mean

1459
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Is a multi multi-millionaire

1460
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,295
He's one of these

1461
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
Incredibly rich

1462
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
Yeah he is

1463
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
Is very but he might be

1464
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:40,511
I don't know anything about it but I do I mean he's

1465
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Football in a

1466
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Football

1467
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
Wow

1468
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
Batman

1469
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
That's horrific

1470
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
So you but he's like one of the

1471
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
The biggest people

1472
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
Envy Spring

1473
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,567
World like he is the Michael Jordan of

1474
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Absurd

1475
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Conspiracy

1476
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Instead of the Michael Jordan gambling

1477
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
Right

1478
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Right

1479
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
I don't know about that I don't know how

1480
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
So

1481
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
You can't

1482
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,111
You can't down play David Icke sexual

1483
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,391
Importance to the

1484
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
The Fringe

1485
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
Conspiracy world

1486
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
He's up there

1487
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,487
Play up-top

1488
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:18,911
Because he was talking about this stuff in like the 90s program

1489
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
Words don't

1490
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,775
Well he went on that TV show that we just dropped a tiny clip of

1491
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:24,543
And got my box

1492
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Roundly

1493
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,615
When he said that he was Christ son

1494
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,687
Our godson and said that turquoise is a magical

1495
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
What color you should all wear

1496
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
I do believe

1497
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,367
He says all that stuff on TV gets mocked and then with

1498
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,647
Takes his lumps

1499
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Like he

1500
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Keeps going

1501
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,487
And I think a lot of the people in the

1502
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
The conspiracy Community were really impressed

1503
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,863
Like he became a hero in that he didn't back down

1504
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
When everyone was making fun of him he was like

1505
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Now f*** y'all

1506
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,471
I'm going to keep going

1507
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,775
I have two stomachs that I admire that

1508
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,335
There's a certain amount of it yeah and because he

1509
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,383
He stuck with it he was on the like

1510
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,175
Early floors of a publicly

1511
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,295
I mean there's a song by a

1512
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
George Clinton and P-Funk

1513
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
I'd rather just scream David Icke

1514
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:15,999
I got the word out

1515
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:20,095
You know you're good I also had a friend growing up in Columbia named David Icke

1516
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
Who is just a buddy of mine that I drink with

1517
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Get high with

1518
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
And

1519
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
I thought that the P-Funk song was referring

1520
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,615
Cuz I didn't know about the you didn't know about the famous David Icke

1521
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,175
You just assumed that your buddy

1522
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,991
Was I supposed to smoke a lot of weed

1523
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,039
Unbelievable thing

1524
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:45,439
Here's another unbelievable thing Alex Jones talking about ways you

1525
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Street cops

1526
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,023
Oh no

1527
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
I'm we keep putting this information out

1528
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,399
The information is so powerful

1529
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
In the end

1530
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,615
Why because it's true and Josh

1531
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,551
When your scared of government

1532
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,999
They absolutely run

1533
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
That must be because you're white

1534
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
Can you open

1535
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
Can you imagine the scenario

1536
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
What to do with race Dan

1537
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
Blue lives matter his argument

1538
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:35,103
Is that he's making is that if you're scared of cops they'll run all over you

1539
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,919
But if you talk to them like children they Runaway

1540
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Or if you laugh at them

1541
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,807
That does not work for everybody Alex

1542
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,855
To murder you and then 45

1543
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
Translator

1544
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:52,511
Murder El kabong

1545
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Chicago Hoover

1546
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,327
Leading the abolished

1547
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
Police movement no

1548
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,631
It's

1549
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Very it's very

1550
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Sing idea like

1551
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,983
They're point being that

1552
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,263
The police were really just a

1553
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
Established

1554
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:10,175
To take the rich people protect the property of rich people

1555
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Well I guess kind of where they

1556
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
From covid-19

1557
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,575
Is that both of their first album

1558
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:20,927
I meant they released one that only Martin shkreli has

1559
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
Or does he

1560
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
Play my God

1561
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
I know is that your day just

1562
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Want to replace it

1563
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,375
Something that

1564
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Not inherently race

1565
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
Which I don't know

1566
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
I don't know what that would be like

1567
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Could it be

1568
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
Simple p

1569
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Keeping Force

1570
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
What they would we allow the

1571
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,967
Braided beard

1572
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
I don't know maybe so

1573
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
Some sort of community organization

1574
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,575
In the house oversight boards and stuff like that

1575
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,647
Play I don't know I think it's whatever

1576
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
Whatever cops

1577
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:53,951
Have a boy

1578
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
Black-site

1579
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,511
In Chicago like the fuc

1580
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
CIA

1581
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
God dammit

1582
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
I understand it's going to f******

1583
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,447
Far-right and they're immunize from any kind of concert

1584
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
Sequences for their

1585
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
Which is

1586
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
Messy closet

1587
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
You have

1588
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
Federal crimes

1589
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,759
Ruling on that

1590
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,807
F*** face who just murdered a black.

1591
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
And got off

1592
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,391
St.Louis

1593
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,439
The last line of the judge

1594
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
His ruling was

1595
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
It is

1596
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,535
It is an easy as some

1597
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
How to make

1598
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Betty heroin

1599
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
Dealer would have a gun in his

1600
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
Right and

1601
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
There's no evidence

1602
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
Oh no not at all

1603
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,335
Walker discharge was just says what

1604
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
Is a f****** racist

1605
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,175
Is it lonely at Mommy.

1606
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,199
Deconstructed Society

1607
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
Because I agree with that premise as

1608
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
As you phrased it

1609
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
Is it

1610
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
In any way races

1611
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:59,231
If if if you are just talking about the general group heroin

1612
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,839
Dealers is it weird to assume that a heroin dealer would have a gun

1613
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
Okay weird to assume that

1614
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,983
Every black man driving alone in a car is a heroin dealer

1615
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
Racist motherfuking

1616
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,103
Judge who just

1617
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:22,015
God dammit I look just the cops during the protest now you can see the inherent race

1618
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,807
Within the police force

1619
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Ripped up with all of this

1620
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
Anti-riot gear

1621
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,463
Lying about what other people are doing

1622
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
So they can just

1623
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Defied their

1624
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
A bastard violent

1625
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Against

1626
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:40,703
And a lot of that comes into like the intersection of the militarization of police

1627
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
And the classic

1628
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Like all of it

1629
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,543
Is bundled together

1630
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Quite but

1631
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
David Icke

1632
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
Does not believe necessarily that it's bad

1633
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
Humans

1634
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
That are doing things

1635
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Like the stuff

1636
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
We're talking about

1637
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Disbelieve that

1638
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,159
He has a completely different take on

1639
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Check this out

1640
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,791
But I mean

1641
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:10,655
About this

1642
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Right

1643
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
There is an area

1644
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,567
I've been pulling together

1645
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
At the same time

1646
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Find it

1647
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Very compelling

1648
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
When I say I see

1649
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,415
Very different peoples and very different sources coming to the same conclusions and talking about the same things

1650
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,839
Which is described

1651
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,631
Precisely the same way

1652
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,215
By Styx

1653
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,311
By the pre-islamic Arabian sand

1654
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
Islam picked it up the gin

1655
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,919
They calling me Central America the flyer

1656
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
Christian School

1657
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,015
The demons and so on and so forth

1658
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,319
When you look at what he said

1659
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:06,207
About these writings from 2000 years ago say about

1660
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,255
Please

1661
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,471
Have the ability

1662
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
For what

1663
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,335
The gnostics code intentionality what I will translate as

1664
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
Creative imagination

1665
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,895
It's like

1666
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
Try to get a computer to create something Yukon

1667
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,831
In the information to create

1668
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Does Truitt

1669
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,279
We have creative imagination

1670
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,327
To create

1671
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,911
The world that they want which is this

1672
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
Nightmare

1673
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
And then some

1674
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,127
To get us to use our creative imagination

1675
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,687
That's why they

1676
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
Programming

1677
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
Constantly

1678
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
What's up

1679
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
It's not a pardon

1680
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,135
So it's the archons or the jinns are the demons

1681
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,719
They're possessing people to act all bad because I need to create this world

1682
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,815
But they don't have any creativity they have to allow a they possess us

1683
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
To use our creativity or something

1684
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Also

1685
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
Do you want to look into it there's some really in

1686
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Stuff like

1687
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,239
Computers can compose music

1688
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,287
Computers can create art

1689
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
Essentially of their own volition

1690
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,127
They're granted you do have to have like

1691
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
Gear S2 have access to examples

1692
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,991
But it can create entirely new thing

1693
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,295
Out of

1694
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,111
And then your question because

1695
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
Comes what is it

1696
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Worth

1697
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
You know that kind

1698
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Is there any

1699
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,535
Stickability roll

1700
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
Although there is one thing that does make

1701
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,887
Is that whenever you see

1702
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
See so many

1703
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Coming to

1704
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
To the same conclusion

1705
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Or at least

1706
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
You just assume it's

1707
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,103
Cuz you didn't f****** read anything

1708
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,639
Think about it for a few goddamn

1709
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
But the point being

1710
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,735
2000 years ago

1711
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:08,575
It's the same f****** idiots who are trying to just

1712
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
By human behavior

1713
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,927
By attributing it to something

1714
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,951
Elsewise

1715
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,023
No reason that my my dad

1716
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
Constantly goes on about how human beings are

1717
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Fallen

1718
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Is because

1719
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
It's in

1720
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Possible to just take

1721
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,983
Responsibility for being an a******

1722
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
Yeah like that's just what they

1723
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Can't deal with

1724
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,591
It's always always been a human

1725
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
Tradition to be like

1726
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:37,247
It was witches

1727
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,551
It's Jim it's whatever the f*** you want to call it

1728
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,367
Right and if you want to take

1729
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
Just because you brought in witches

1730
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
If you want to look at the history of witches

1731
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,279
Traditional

1732
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:55,167
Misogynist brothers that and then also like the Salem Witch Trials was about land basically it wasn't even about the

1733
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
It was using

1734
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
Demonic

1735
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
Language

1736
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,031
In order to facilitate whatever

1737
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:04,639
Economic goals you already have and that's what David Icke is doing to

1738
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
Strange that a lot of the women who were a

1739
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
To being witches were

1740
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
Widows or single women

1741
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,063
Who owned thing

1742
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,599
Right and if you got

1743
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
Killed as a witch

1744
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,903
Guess we're all of that

1745
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,975
Stuff went there and they had land disputes with the like

1746
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Family

1747
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,839
Call such crazy. There was a

1748
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Guy who wanted an

1749
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
Inherit something

1750
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,679
Grandmas

1751
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,263
I don't know if that's the same one but there was one guy wanted to

1752
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,031
Didn't hear it stuff

1753
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,615
But she was widowed and she married a black guy

1754
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,943
And yeah

1755
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:45,343
That one could not have been more open and shut for those guys because then the guy would inherit property

1756
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
Not going to happen that's all this stuff about demonic stuff there's a lot of different brand

1757
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
Chances that it covers

1758
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
In terms of what

1759
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,863
It's B one part that stuff bigotry misogyny

1760
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
It like that throughout his

1761
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,703
And then the other is not trying to wrestle with

1762
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
The downside of Being Human

1763
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,823
Sometimes do f***** up stuff

1764
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,615
And they do it.

1765
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,383
They do it

1766
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
4

1767
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
Their own game

1768
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,223
Yeah like they once

1769
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
Can convince

1770
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,015
Dumpy

1771
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
People to just believe in this

1772
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,623
Nan said it so they can get what they want

1773
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,927
It would be fun if it was all gone

1774
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,207
Party that's what it is

1775
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
Everybody back

1776
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
Brought it back to politics

1777
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,327
Alright so here's some more about these archons David Icke

1778
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Tell you about

1779
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,935
They can be described

1780
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,239
The Gnostic said in one word

1781
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Deceivers

1782
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
That method

1783
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,103
Manipulation is deception

1784
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
They all mind parasite

1785
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,735
Antiparasite of human energy and they

1786
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:49,599
Parasite of the human mind and manipulate the human mind this is the Christian

1787
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
Perception of

1788
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
The Possession which is true

1789
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,743
These things these things exist

1790
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,583
Energetic field so energetic entities

1791
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,679
They look into people at the electromagnetic field

1792
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:09,567
Level and then start dictating through that the perceptions of the behavior of the possessed person

1793
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,895
The gnostics

1794
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,431
The

1795
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,807
Able to create something that they call Hal h a l

1796
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,367
Which translates as wait for it

1797
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
Virtual reality

1798
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:29,279
They have the ability to make you burst anything on actually

1799
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,095
By manipulating the way

1800
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:38,239
Fat people construct reality in the few cubic centimeters the back of the brain that's how I do

1801
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,287
Sedan

1802
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,591
That is been mentioned already today

1803
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
Eastbay invert

1804
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,527
Everything

1805
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,599
Turn everything on its head

1806
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:57,695
The winter bomber talks about love he's talking about hate

1807
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:03,327
You got everything upside down

1808
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:08,703
When the rituals are worshiping and interact

1809
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
Invert

1810
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,263
Everything

1811
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,567
Across the Universe

1812
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:19,456
Oh

1813
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,016
Everything is turned upside down

1814
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:28,416
Is why this is the force

1815
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:32,512
Families in Elite families and Bloodlines are so obsessed with bloodline

1816
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,328
Have a hybrid genetics

1817
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Hybrid

1818
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
Energetic

1819
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
Field

1820
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:44,800
Which is much closer to the energetic

1821
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:56,064
If you miss admirations because they have be specifically created on the Buddy

1822
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:56,832
The level

1823
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:02,720
Energetically vibrational frequency wise

1824
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:07,840
Closely connected to these all come to concert is it up right outside of you inside

1825
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:13,216
The possession of these Bloodlines is able to be

1826
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:19,104
Stan is the general population

1827
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:25,248
When you looking at the Rockefeller snow Rothschild in the British royal family and all these people

1828
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,808
You are looking at these are Concepts

1829
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Entities

1830
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:34,976
Incarnated in your remote control

1831
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,512
Run from Houston

1832
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,400
No empathy they have no conscience

1833
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,752
Society

1834
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,544
To bring about an end

1835
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,080
Total human control

1836
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
So

1837
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
Why

1838
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,432
What would you mean been around

1839
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
1000

1840
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,248
Years how would they not already

1841
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,552
Cuz they're waiting for the endgame

1842
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,576
Which is I guess

1843
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,856
Trump I don't know

1844
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,160
Why would you do that

1845
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
I don't know

1846
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,256
Control

1847
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
What

1848
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
Terbium

1849
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,840
Control when they're already in control

1850
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,144
I know it's stupid

1851
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
But would they

1852
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Okay

1853
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,960
Again war games

1854
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:21,568
More games you get rid of we didn't have a graphic

1855
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,640
Another word video

1856
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,944
We got to have some more

1857
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,296
Jason Graphics look it up drinking Faygo

1858
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,832
Okay

1859
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
So

1860
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:36,160
Your urine energetic

1861
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,952
Okay first of all what does that look

1862
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Looks like this

1863
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,536
I am an energetic being my man

1864
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,328
Alright 7th density like being

1865
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
Okay. Go ahead

1866
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:48,960
Alright so if I shot a laser at you turn into a hologram something like that

1867
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,496
No one's ever tried

1868
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,264
So

1869
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,824
You are interbreeding with

1870
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
British people

1871
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,152
And and the Rockefellers

1872
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
And then

1873
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
The goal is to

1874
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,504
To get rid of totaled

1875
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Right

1876
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Okay

1877
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
And then what

1878
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:12,000
I don't why don't like playing this war game cuz I don't know it's total control

1879
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
They already have

1880
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
Look I want to tell you this

1881
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,120
This is another instance of him trying to artistic

1882
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,912
Sickly say something that makes

1883
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Some sense

1884
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,264
But because of the way he's doing it because he literally believes the things he

1885
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
He saying

1886
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,336
He's crazy what he's talking about

1887
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
In terms of these bloodline

1888
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
Is his explanation

1889
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,176
Open for ideas

1890
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,272
Text intermarry and do that because

1891
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
Their bloodlines are

1892
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
Easier for the archon

1893
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,136
To manipulate

1894
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
And

1895
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
Possess

1896
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Their bodies

1897
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
So the archons are are

1898
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,584
Demanding that these bloodlines

1899
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,144
Stay pure in order that they be the vessels

1900
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,936
For their evil plans on Earth

1901
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
The reality is

1902
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
That this is just a practice

1903
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
It goes back to

1904
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
The beginnings of human history

1905
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Where in

1906
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:03,968
Rich people don't marry outside of property classes

1907
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
Because you will lose

1908
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
What you have

1909
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,856
That's why in a lot of cultures you'd marry your cousin

1910
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
Things like that

1911
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,904
Property within

1912
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
In the family

1913
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
Answer you have these people who are like

1914
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,256
The Rothschilds

1915
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,328
Who everybody likes to appoint their little leggy finger at

1916
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,632
They marry Within

1917
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,912
Higher stratum

1918
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,936
Because

1919
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
Some reason

1920
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:31,616
Don't want to lose billions of dollars to somebody in a divorce or whatever to get marry another child of a billionaire

1921
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,152
Yeah it's no real issue

1922
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,456
I'll have your s*** already and you can

1923
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,760
Consolidate you also make alliances

1924
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,832
Between Super Rich families that bring more

1925
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
Into both of your families

1926
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:46,464
So that is why they do it it's not because of archon possession

1927
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
Natalie pathological need

1928
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,816
Keep stuff now we get back to where he

1929
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:54,144
Accidentally kind of advocating for socialism

1930
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,168
Because

1931
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,240
He wants to stop this archon possession

1932
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,312
And all that s*** in the bloodlines

1933
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
Disruption of the bloodline

1934
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:06,432
When's or whatever and we would too but is why he wants to

1935
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,760
To raise the estate tax

1936
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,088
And it should be after 2000000 instead of 5

1937
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,744
I don't disagree with that but I think that that that magical worldview but very

1938
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,304
Very sensible solutions to it

1939
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,328
Like listen

1940
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,376
All these f****** energetic

1941
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,424
Bees are, are taking

1942
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
All of our money

1943
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,264
Pulling all of this b******* and

1944
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
That's why I think we

1945
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
We need a return to the

1946
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,336
The New Deal

1947
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
I need to establish a 95% tax

1948
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
On the wealthy

1949
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
You know what I mean like you

1950
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,320
You're crazy you're crazy I like you

1951
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:49,440
You don't have been thinking about I've been thinking a lot about the idea that people like Alex Jones

1952
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
The people of the libertarian bent

1953
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Back to I get into inches

1954
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,328
The idea that if you make it

1955
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
Like

1956
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,936
If you take if you tax super-rich people then they'll be no incentive

1957
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,984
Super rich

1958
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,032
My response to that is

1959
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Good

1960
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:09,152
I don't think that there should be an incentive to have 20 billion dollars or whatever

1961
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,224
I think as I've seen

1962
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,088
Our friend Katie McVey is opposed to this couple times I think it's a really good way of putting it

1963
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,392
The choice of being super wealthy

1964
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
Is Amora Lisa

1965
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
Suspicious choice

1966
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,840
Yeah I like I kind of agree with that that's very brother if you have over 10 billion dollars in your charge 100 per

1967
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120
Percent tax

1968
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:34,752
Over 10 million dollars that you make in a year that does not be incentivize people to make business

1969
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,640
That doesn't do incentivised able to be reasonably wildly successful all it does

1970
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:47,040
It'd be like if you make over 10 million dollars in a year you're probably f****** something up you're probably doing something he leave

1971
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:53,440
Google or at least like why do you need to do that and then you make over 10 million dollars here until 1

1972
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,976
Charity

1973
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,512
Problem solves itself

1974
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,536
Pennywise

1975
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
Just that but

1976
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,072
If you

1977
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,608
Incentivize

1978
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,400
To get a billion dollars

1979
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Instead of 10

1980
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,472
10 million that opens up more

1981
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
More space in the market for

1982
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
For somebody else

1983
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,800
To try and get some of that

1984
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
10 million-dollar

1985
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,200
Or or apple or if Google is like a 70 billion dollar company or whatever

1986
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,480
And they only got to keep

1987
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
10 million

1988
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:21,856
All of a sudden

1989
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
But they don't want to grow as big

1990
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:28,768
Well it was Allstate and they would want to pay their f****** employee

1991
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:35,168
Exactly incentivize taken care of everybody a little bit more because then if you're so against paying

1992
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:41,568
Taxes you can get around that it operating costs by paying people reasonable amount of money

1993
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:47,968
I fully support I've been possessed by the archons

1994
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Or

1995
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
The dark

1996
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Carnival

1997
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,552
One of the two

1998
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,344
Woop woop to my homies

1999
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,624
This is why we should

2000
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,952
So a in an NRA

2001
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,488
In our estimation David Icke

2002
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Is maybe trying to

2003
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,792
Expressive reasonable thing

2004
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,328
In a crazy way

2005
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
And we're not the only people who think God

2006
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
David Icke

2007
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
It's crazy here so here's what Alex says to him

2008
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,728
This is business

2009
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,520
Bizarre for him to be saying

2010
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
But I like it

2011
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
I remember

2012
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,616
First reading

2013
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,712
You want to hear bugs like 18 years ago

2014
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,184
No

2015
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
And

2016
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,216
Because I'm hearing about all this occultism

2017
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,336
Thought

2018
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,696
I didn't even know that

2019
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:06,048
So that flies in the face of how he presented everything back then

2020
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,352
And the entire documentary he goes in

2021
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,400
Expecting to find proof that there were spanked

2022
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,240
But he accidentally let slip

2023
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
Planning to find

2024
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:20,640
Write a Jon Ronson has said that is basically what he did he was thrilled

2025
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
To misrepresent the things

2026
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,944
Defiled in order

2027
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
To prove his Beast

2028
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,504
Sis of devil worship

2029
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
But the other thing he let slip that

2030
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,600
Some TV station

2031
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,368
Feed him

2032
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
To sneak out

2033
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,440
I don't think I've ever heard him mention that

2034
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
No are you sure that

2035
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:35,488
I bet

2036
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,768
Man that sounds like a

2037
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
Kauai the right

2038
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,816
It's hard to say

2039
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,376
With him it's always either a lie or an axe

2040
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,448
I think it would I think it's true

2041
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,216
Because

2042
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
Fayetteville I would

2043
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,544
Be someone else paid me to do it

2044
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
Yeah that's

2045
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,152
Takes away from The credibility of the documentary

2046
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:55,968
Yeah that's now at this point has a financial incentive to

2047
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,992
To make it more

2048
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,272
Bulshit

2049
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
But was it broadcast

2050
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Cast Ynet

2051
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,600
No I don't

2052
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,904
No but the people who are along with him where

2053
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,976
From Channel 3 couple people from Channel 4 I believe

2054
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
Let's do they broadcast their own thing

2055
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:12,096
And maybe use some of his footage but his documentary was

2056
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:12,864
Broadcast

2057
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Gotcha

2058
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,448
So I don't know if that's weird

2059
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,472
Suspicious

2060
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
Right

2061
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,104
The next not even Morris

2062
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
Suspicious

2063
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,944
So we we've documented in 2015 and 27

2064
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,992
Some incredibly pro-russia

2065
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,272
Positions on Alex's Park

2066
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,552
He

2067
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
May or may not have

2068
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
I had interaction with Russian intelligence

2069
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
Yep

2070
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Consistently think Putin is the last thing said

2071
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,256
Us and the Ant

2072
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Antichrist

2073
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,864
And here's one of his comments on Russian propaganda back

2074
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
Back in 20

2075
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,656
Love it

2076
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,288
To article about

2077
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,920
Was funded by hundreds of millions of dollars

2078
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,224
Russian government money

2079
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:04,576
On Iranian TV British TV French TV

2080
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,648
Brazilian TV

2081
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:17,120
Tony moly on us television when they call me or they stuff going just because half the time they cash

2082
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,872
5 generator views that actually just say whatever I wanted to

2083
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
I would suspect

2084
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,976
Constitution was Don Meredith

2085
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
Yep

2086
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:50,144
So in the beginning of that clip you admits that Artie was founded with millions of dollars of Russian money

2087
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:55,776
How does a Russian State media Outlet takes public funds

2088
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,568
Swell soda

2089
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
I saw some of our

2090
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,408
Voice of America whatever go

2091
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,480
Definitely okay for a government to invest

2092
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,504
In a

2093
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,784
Media out

2094
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,576
Find the way they

2095
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,856
It is important

2096
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,416
9 or how they

2097
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,232
I definitely think that there is no finer

2098
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,024
Or

2099
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,072
Violent incentive

2100
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,120
To support everything The Rush

2101
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,168
But goes crazy

2102
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,752
And so Alex even admitting that he understands that it's

2103
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,288
State media

2104
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,568
Still is like

2105
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
They let me say whatever I want

2106
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,920
And they told me that the head is a listener

2107
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
Yeah and

2108
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,504
I'm right on

2109
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,528
If you started with

2110
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Alex

2111
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
I love your show

2112
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
Right

2113
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,136
You could then say everything

2114
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
You say

2115
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,768
Kneb like you know what you might have a point there I think I could pick you love me

2116
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,536
I love you

2117
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,840
I think I could tweet at him and be like we're big fans

2118
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,376
Can we get a retweet and he might

2119
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,936
I'm not sure cuz I don't know how to act

2120
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
On Twitter but

2121
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,776
So you gets into

2122
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
Gets it though

2123
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,432
He was early on the David Icke train

2124
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,272
So I ended next clip Alex Jones even Alex says

2125
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,600
Maybe take your own advice Alex

2126
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,904
I was a little smarter back that apparently

2127
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,744
So is that clip Alex Jones has some thoughts about the NRA

2128
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
Bechara

2129
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,240
You know that right

2130
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,776
Guapo's

2131
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,336
Show yes we're in deep trouble

2132
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,360
So

2133
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:39,712
Is what Alex Jones says on December 21st 2012

2134
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:44,320
Not true but let's go to what you said on June 19th 2015

2135
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,192
About 556 in front of me

2136
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,472
This is a plug

2137
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:06,080
These guns aren't

2138
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Idiotically

2139
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,504
Obviously

2140
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:17,088
Look at The Logical service yet.

2141
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,648
They're now saying gun ownership is racist

2142
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,048
At the end of the Civil War

2143
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
It was race

2144
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,632
The first gun laws were racist

2145
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,960
NRA was a racist organization

2146
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
Is again

2147
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
Upside down

2148
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,288
It's a total fraud

2149
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,592
I'm not even going to get into the NRA history

2150
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,176
But everybody

2151
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,272
Black

2152
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,552
252 Klux Klan

2153
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,600
Again

2154
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,416
And the party the Ku Klux Klan the Democrats want our gun

2155
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:56,000
So Alex Jones sebaik s*** up whenever he wants

2156
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,024
In order to

2157
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,560
Those are contradictory

2158
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
Unless I guess you could say

2159
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:04,960
That the NRA was created by the federal government in order to arm black people to fight the KKK

2160
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,264
All of it's not true of the federal government

2161
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
At the same time

2162
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Passing

2163
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,336
Racist gun laws

2164
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,360
Keep guns away

2165
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,664
Right now the government is

2166
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,200
Responding the NRA

2167
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
And

2168
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,992
Keeping black

2169
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,016
Getting guns

2170
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,320
The magical part about it is a

2171
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:26,720
It's all lies like all of it isn't

2172
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,792
Begin to illustrate like

2173
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,816
He just he's

2174
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,096
Never not making

2175
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
Stuff up

2176
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
It's just

2177
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
Anyway

2178
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
Whatever fits within his

2179
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,984
His narrative at any good

2180
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:41,056
Point-in-time the narrative

2181
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:41,824
It is like

2182
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
He does

2183
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Though

2184
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,920
Make it so it has

2185
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,944
Sarso Malik

2186
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,712
Valuable

2187
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,480
That he can

2188
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:53,856
Turn it into whatever he wants and any possible deniability that's not too impressive

2189
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,136
And once again ever

2190
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,416
Time

2191
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
Somebody

2192
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,024
Republican goes you know Democrats are the party of the

2193
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
Go fuc yourself

2194
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,352
Read an actual f******

2195
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,888
Please

2196
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:11,008
Fluent learn about how parties has changed over time

2197
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,056
Well the Whigs are actually

2198
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,848
You come on

2199
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,688
Lincoln wasn't a Republican or fuckyourself

2200
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
If anybody

2201
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,040
Nowadays tells you that there are classical liberal

2202
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,320
Oh yeah run

2203
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,344
Fox Run

2204
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,136
Because they are a liar

2205
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
And a libertarian

2206
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
I'm at me

2207
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
You got to get out of there

2208
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,024
Do we have one more clip

2209
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,304
Trump is a Republican

2210
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
He's a member of the no no

2211
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,912
Is a classical liberal

2212
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
F******

2213
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:45,056
Also I should point this out over the last week

2214
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,848
Whatever this

2215
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,384
Bears that will have been last week

2216
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,200
Alex Jones

2217
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,784
That to Alex Jones has come out and said that he might so

2218
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
Support The Rock

2219
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,112
Against Trump

2220
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,416
That's true I think we can get together on the

2221
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:03,744
Not one pet stroller

2222
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
Alex

2223
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,840
He made it it'll take that seriously trying to get head lice

2224
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,144
So is our last clip

2225
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,936
We have

2226
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Faucet off now

2227
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,568
Terrible

2228
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
It's it's

2229
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
Horrific but it's it's like

2230
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,152
You barely even

2231
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,432
Saw the news

2232
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,992
It's another school shooting

2233
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,784
Nobody's going to do anything about it

2234
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,600
We're just going to watch more kids die every f******

2235
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:34,464
Alex's argument would be that that means it was a real shooting and not a false flag because

2236
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
Cuz it didn't get a lot of press

2237
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,560
Okay cuz you know the real ones you don't talk about

2238
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,584
You want to give attention

2239
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,888
I don't want to go down that line cuz I

2240
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,192
Play this last clip

2241
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,240
It's it's a delight

2242
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,032
And it's which one of those

2243
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,312
Every now and again

2244
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,896
We get to do an episode where The Parting Shot like the last

2245
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,432
Clip is perfect

2246
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,456
And this is

2247
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Perfect

2248
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,248
This is great

2249
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
This is Alex

2250
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,576
Being a dumb dumb Alex man

2251
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:04,160
He's finished his interview with David Icke he's gone

2252
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,976
I've talked a lot about archons and all that s***

2253
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,024
Anti-heroes

2254
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,352
Here is how he tries to end the broadcast

2255
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,888
Jay this tickles

2256
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
We live in a world of wonderment

2257
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,472
And and

2258
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
Credible

2259
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,800
Opportunity

2260
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
And

2261
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,408
The only reasonable is in charge is because good men and women

2262
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,688
Do nothing

2263
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,480
Do you know that

2264
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,552
I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity

2265
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,928
Christmas Santa we have right now.

2266
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:42,816
Holiday now we can make it into something good to give the gift of proof

2267
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:49,216
Whether it's a copy one of my films already in Forbes Magazine

2268
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,288
Dot-com

2269
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,384
95 a month

2270
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,688
Passcode

2271
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:02,784
Christmas shopping done right there and the crazy crowd all the car wrecks

2272
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:09,440
Prisonplanet.tv

2273
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
Alternative media system

2274
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
And and

2275
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,680
Do it

2276
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:21,728
Oh that's great though

2277
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
Even though it's

2278
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Been taken over by the glow

2279
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,568
Make sure you celebrate

2280
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
And giving my pride

2281
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,480
Capitalism

2282
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:35,040
The trout ternative media system

2283
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Bereavement

2284
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:42,976
To me it's perfect solution of what Alex Jones is everything in there

2285
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,512
Like it has the

2286
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,536
Beer like

2287
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,304
Car wrecks

2288
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,328
You know car wreck

2289
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,376
Everytime I go to the store car wrap

2290
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,656
8/3 cars

2291
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,240
Glittering our street by you can refer lousy with cars

2292
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Ridiculous

2293
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,336
Then then we've got the Christmas and

2294
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,432
It's been taking over it's a Christian holiday taken over by the door

2295
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:05,760
Oh absolutely and then at the same time

2296
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Very much

2297
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
In the

2298
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,856
Complete opposite direction

2299
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:15,488
Just go and we should celebrate it the way the globalist have told us to buy box wood from me

2300
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:21,376
Text me because eventually I will take down the Christmas

2301
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:25,216
Right and then all the Whos in Whoville

2302
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,032
There's no way he would

2303
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,080
Want to take down the globalist

2304
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,128
Because then nobody would buy a ship

2305
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:32,896
Right

2306
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,200
I don't think he has a place in the world

2307
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,224
After the globalist

2308
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,016
But that's why

2309
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,088
That's why he does the things that he does

2310
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,648
We haven't

2311
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,464
We picked a real one unfortunately

2312
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,256
Brightright we're just trying to get

2313
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:52,096
Through what is real and what is fake about him

2314
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:56,960
That's that's what he did on December 21st 2012

2315
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:01,824
I do respect and admire that at least he wasn't getting into the

2316
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:08,480
Nibiru is right behind the Sun and that's why you can't see it

2317
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,784
I respect that

2318
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,088
The great that's what a lot of people said

2319
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,112
Right behind

2320
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:18,208
It's like why the Earth isn't moving at all it's not going around

2321
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:24,608
I bet it's right behind that's what that's what a lot of arguments were for like why you couldn't see it it's like oh it's being hidden

2322
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
By the Sun so if you stare up if you have a telescope

2323
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,728
And you look up the sun will be too bright for you to see

2324
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,544
See the brighten the Blue Roof right they're coming for us

2325
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,152
I mean

2326
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,688
First of all

2327
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
David Icke

2328
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,248
Is wacky and allowing him

2329
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
To just like

2330
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,576
Through all this s*** around about archons on his

2331
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,392
I used to think you're crazy but now

2332
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,160
York Rite

2333
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
That's irresponsible

2334
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
How many how many of these

2335
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,536
Corvus wasn't there

2336
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,352
They're outside

2337
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,656
But I want to bring this to current day

2338
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,704
Because last week

2339
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,008
On the Wednesday episode I believe

2340
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,544
He had a guy on

2341
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,616
Who was pitching September 23rd 2017

2342
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,640
Teen Doomsday

2343
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
Conspiracies

2344
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
So

2345
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:13,248
He's never he's learned his lesson about Y2K

2346
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,040
Is he just going to replay the

2347
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:15,808
The

2348
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,832
December 21st

2349
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,136
2012 episode

2350
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:21,696
Just like maybe

2351
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,768
Riri do that either I'm taking the day off yet

2352
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:29,120
I don't know I meant he's learned the lesson of Y2K which is that can never do that again

2353
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,912
People made fun of me

2354
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
Hard

2355
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,984
You can't do that but what he can do

2356
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:37,056
Is giving you no like a everyone wants to

2357
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
Scared

2358
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,128
So let's give him like a little bit of a

2359
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:43,200
Talk about demonic entities possess

2360
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:43,968
Sing the elites

2361
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
Or something like that makes

2362
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:48,832
I'm at now in 2017 diversion that he's doing his

2363
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,600
Alright

2364
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,160
I do want to do the Y2K

2365
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:52,928
Free stuff again

2366
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:58,304
I can't do it no good have to let my guests do it

2367
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:04,704
And then make clear that I don't know if I believe them or not right I have to play the fence and let my guest speaker

2368
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,496
And that's kind of what he's doing

2369
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Even though he's

2370
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,800
Still going to at some point

2371
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,848
Now you're absolutely right

2372
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,920
Well I mean did this September 23rd 2017 thing

2373
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
11 / 2

2374
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:22,880
I'll tell you after the show replay also of September 23rd

2375
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,672
15 they did this back then

2376
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
And Weaver

2377
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:29,536
Heard Alex talkin about that in our investigation it's the blood moon

2378
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:33,376
Stuff it's not Jewish calendar in Blood Moon

2379
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,192
Fox but now it's two years delayed because

2380
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:36,960
I guess

2381
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,032
King Herod needed to kill all the two-year-olds

2382
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:45,408
Everybody under 2 years old in the Bible

2383
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,712
Or maybe we didn't get the date

2384
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,088
Always a little there's always a loophole or we're making setup wasn't built

2385
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Until like

2386
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,904
480 or whatever the

2387
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:58,720
Or we're making s*** up to get YouTube

2388
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,000
Which is more likely

2389
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,072
YouTube

2390
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:09,472
No I'm not going to let you do this until

2391
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
So you do it in a British accent

2392
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:15,872
Boys Show Goes On

2393
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
People do you think

2394
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,408
Think if

2395
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
We just had a sigh

2396
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Psychiatrist

2397
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:23,296
You know like time traveling psychiatrist

2398
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
Alright

2399
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
Alright again

2400
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:29,440
Next movie okay great all right

2401
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
Theme song that would be

2402
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,024
Frontier psychiatrist

2403
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:33,792
Therapy

2404
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,632
No it's like with David Icke

2405
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,168
That moment that he's

2406
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
Describes is very clearly lie

2407
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,008
Like you're talking about the Elmo Mountain without

2408
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
That's you have abscess

2409
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,080
Compulsive

2410
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:51,200
Or Break It was psychotic break

2411
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Give you a gotten

2412
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,504
Immediately after

2413
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
All of his many brain damage

2414
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,880
I bruised under that house or after

2415
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,928
Once he started getting those

2416
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
Skip

2417
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
It's a phrenic

2418
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,048
Imagine

2419
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:06,816
If you had an anti

2420
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,864
Like how

2421
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,008
How normal would he be like all of these people my man I don't think I don't think you ever be normal

2422
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
I'm just

2423
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,336
God bless him for it we don't want normal

2424
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
This is a posture

2425
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,384
Okay

2426
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,408
But it is

2427
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:25,760
All of these people or f****** go back in time and how many of those religious figures

2428
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:27,552
Is it just like oh well if you had some

2429
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,320
Epileptic

2430
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,368
We wouldn't have

2431
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Like that kind

2432
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,952
Well I mean sure but if you didn't

2433
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
Like shamans didn't take substance

2434
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
Senses they wouldn't have like cool

2435
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
Religious

2436
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:44,704
Traditions in Native culture

2437
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:47,520
Instead of just being Kravitz's getting high

2438
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,592
That's just on during a blood moon

2439
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:55,200
What happened during every show with bringing force in super male vitality

2440
01:45:56,992 --> 01:46:00,576
Transition out of that a****** I don't know I don't know if having

2441
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,624
Psychiatrist will help cuz I think it allotted

2442
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,232
Does you describe the damage is already done would be incredibly resistant

2443
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,256
Any kind of help

2444
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
Like David lights

2445
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,120
That's the point of it is that all of these people also hates

2446
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,400
Psychiatrist

2447
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,680
Like the Scientologist

2448
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
Listing all of that if you got

2449
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:20,288
David Icke after he came down from that mountain doing the Christ pose

2450
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,568
And you tried to tell him he

2451
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,592
He was crazy

2452
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:26,688
Thought you'd be like you're another person telling me I'm crazy and I know that I'm not

2453
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,480
Cuz that voice talking to me on the mountain

2454
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
You told me I'm not

2455
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
Well that's why you

2456
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Just hide in

2457
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
The bushes

2458
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
No

2459
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
The different voices

2460
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,672
David

2461
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,720

2462
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,280
Pictures of dick

2463
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:45,632
Just pulled up at Mountain voices trolling news

2464
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:51,008
I don't think it would work more with God

2465
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544

2466
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,640
