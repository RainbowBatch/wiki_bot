Months

00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:10,143
Prior Governor Deval Patrick called for everyone to stay inside because of the winter storm

124
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,751
Could be arrested or fine

125
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
Talk about that

126
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,063

Come together

132
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,327
His certainty was naturally

133
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
His own imagination

134
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
But the effect was clear

135
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
He was blowing up

136
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703

139
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Traffic was coming into the website like

00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Like crazy

141
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
How to disrupt Boston officials press conference

142
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
Successfully able to calm

143
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Televised events

144
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Including the one on the 8th

145
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
Teeth where the FBI released photographs

146
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
The two suspects

147
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Who are still at that point on identified

148
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839

00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
Is going for which was driving tons of traffic to Alex

150
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
That press conference had another important effect

151
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Ultimately

152
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
We're far more relevant

153
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
To the real world

154
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
April 18th was the day that everything broke wide open

155
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,735
4 days since the bombing the perpetrators had every reason to think that they've gotten away with

156
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,135
They return to their normal lives

157
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
5:20 p.m. on the 18th

158
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
The FBI release their photo

159
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
The illusion of safety with gone

160
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,631
Matter of time for someone

161
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
And don't speak 24 hours of

162
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Complete chaos

163
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
At 10:31 p.m. MIT police officer Sean Collier is murdered sitting in his car which investigators determined

164
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
These guys to get another gun

165
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,855
This murder happened very close to an armed robbery that happened at a convenience store

166
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
So early reports got the two of them mixed up.

167
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
People thought they were connected but they were

168
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
That was another

169
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Thing that is stored apart

170
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
The conspiracy Canon but Alex doesn't

171
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Actually

172
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Diculous

173
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
How to make

174
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Metropolitan area

175
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
To be another unrelated

176
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Have you ever

177
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
The phone

178
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Somebody was on the other line

179
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
Phone call at 8

180
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,695
Describe significance to it where there may not be

181
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Convenience store

182
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,143
SUV less than an hour later at 11

183
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
10:20 p.m.

184
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Holding driver hostage with them

185
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
They were

186
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Pretty camera shopping for a bunch of snack

187
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,199
You later tell the detectives that their plan was to drive to New York and set off another bomb

188
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
This plan to be derailed by the SUV's owner Escape in the car

189
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
To a different nearby convenience store where you called

190
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Police

191
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
You can easily find security camera footage of the driver run

192
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
To that store terrified

193
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Hiding behind the counter and calling apps

194
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
Tell him that he been carjacked by men claiming to be the bombers

195
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
GPS system

196
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,031
You can also easily find footage from the same time of the older bomber coming into

197
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
The gas station

198
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Tell the younger brother

199
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
That the driver had it was time to go

200
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
The younger guy drops all the snacks and they run out back to the car

201
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Later in this episode

202
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
Alex and a collar will discuss how the bombers were in a Mercedes

203
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
And how that's really suspicious

204
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Speculate

205
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
This money

206
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
They stole it from the sky

207
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
DeLand older

208
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Sure I think that might

209
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Are you sure

210
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Pretty sure

211
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
The police track that SUV to address in Watertown

212
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
The first responding officer spouses

213
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
Disengage until the supervisor arrived

214
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,927
He follows the SUV then around 12:41 a.m. the driver of the SUV gets out approaches

215
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Who's the star in start shooting

216
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Approximately 8 minutes

217
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
With both sides exchanged gunfire

218
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
In one of the bombers throwing IEDs

219
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Which Alex

220
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Will later miss identify as

221
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
He does that in order

222
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,591
Do you like how they get their hands on grenades

223
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
They made

224
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,223
Which is well within the range

225
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,647
At 12:49 a.m. the older brother is tackled by police after he run out of bullets

226
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
The officers attempted to get him subdued and

227
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
The officers jumpmans

228
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
To jump out of his run over as it partners

229
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Before 1 a.m. the shootout in Watertown who come to an

230
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
The older bomber is taken

231
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
To the hospital

232
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Timberlands

233
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,295
And with this information to able to identify

234
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Neutralizing one suspect is probably a good thing

235
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Considered be hard to consider this night's event

236
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
A good result

237
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
What officer has been severely injured

238
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Sustained injuries that would end up killing it

239
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Approximately a year later

240
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
The one suspect was down please

241
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Successful in giving Chase to Johor

242
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
Who appeared

243
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
From the site of the

244
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
Police went to work immediately

245
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
All points bulletin percent out and bomb squads were

246
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
Were called into duty lies the unexploded IDS

247
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
The brothers have laughed

248
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Epicene

249
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
News of the flare-up broke real quick

250
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,303
And almost immediately the Watertown Police Department is

251
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Suspicious individual

252
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
All of them look into inside unrelated

253
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Do the search for johar

254
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
In the 24-hour span the department receives over 500 calls to 911

255
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,847
As opposed to their normal daily average of 30

256
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
These people were dealing with an overwhelming situation

257
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
And where communities

258
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Protect them from a rogue

259
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Individual on the loose

260
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
It's easy to look at the situation

261
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
What's the need for such a

262
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Police response

263
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
But the reality is simple

264
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
At the time it was very unclear if this was just one kid

265
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,431
Police officer

266
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
When confronted by additional cops

267
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
He responded by throwing

268
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
This is a person who

269
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Killed his brother

270
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,183
Maybe not intentionally but

271
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
It's just like

272
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Probiotics

273
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,863
Up in the air about whether or not you would have died anyway

274
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,479
Viva minute that hospital

275
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
Yeah or he could be

276
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Big thing like a

277
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
The Boston

278
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
There's no way that you're

279
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Just

280
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
There has to be some sort of

281
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Information

282
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
Oh that's

283
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,983
Up in the air

284
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
If he has accomplices

285
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
You cannot allow

286
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
Absolutely

287
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Whatever

288
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Which we know now there wasn't but that's

289
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
That could come from

290
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
If you're able to catch

291
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
The person before

292
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
There's a possibility

293
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,119
Disrupting the larger

294
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
You would need to

295
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
Worst case scenario

296
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Terrible

297
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,943
So at 1:57 a.m.

298
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
The residents of the town

299
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
Asking them to stay inside their homes and Report

300
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
It might be helpful in there may

301
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,719
This obviously isn't given the circumstances I'm not sure there was a good option

302
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
Important distinction needs to be made

303
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
At this point the message to stay indoors was

304
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
Batory order

305
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
And it was very localized to the area directly surrounding the morning

306
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Shootout

307
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,103
People could go outside but the neighbor

308
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,623
Police report was questioned and released

309
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
So it's not like that you'd be shot if you

310
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Which is kind of what Alex would like

311
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
Unified command

312
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Outlet shopping center in Watertown

313
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,687
Coordination between neighboring area Police Department

314
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
As well as the FBI in the Massachusetts Emergency Management

315
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Over 1,000

316
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,135
Individual law enforcement officers are on hand

317
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Deal with it

318
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
And by the end of the day more than 2,500 office

319
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Been involved in some capacity

320
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
At 4:15 a.m. the Massachusetts emergency

321
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Governor Deval Patrick

322
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
National Guard

323
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,055
Do deployed military police into water

324
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
This is another important

325
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
Come here because the authorization come from FEMA or the federal government

326
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
This was a state level

327
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,807
Decision which really punches holes

328
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
States rights

329
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,415
The governor's mansion

330
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
They can call out National Guard for

331
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Situation

332
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
More likely would not have

333
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Exactly

334
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Group of vigilantes

335
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Decision or the most epic

336
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
Not really my interest

337
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
All the argument

338
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
As the morning comes

339
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
120 military police officers

340
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
House-to-house searches

341
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Again by the proper Channel

342
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,263
At 5:15 a.m. the governor of Massachusetts in the mayor of

343
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Andesite

344
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,455
Suspend fast transit services temporarily

345
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
Effectively putting area into locked

346
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
This is the closest thing to martial law

347
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
We've seen in the United States for a long time

348
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,975
And it would be easy to see this as the Fulfillment of Alex's prophecies

349
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
This is a very severe but

350
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
Necessary law enforcement

351
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Cuz what if Joe Hart been part of a larger cell

352
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,007
Or what if he wasn't being on the loose Legend bomb

353
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
Train the next morning

354
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
The worst case scenario of whatever

355
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,919
You to be down to catch him that night would be an unacceptable risk

356
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
The police did not do this how they do

357
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Release that's my position

358
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
And it seems like the residence of Boston

359
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,695
WBUR did a survey a year later

360
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
April 2014

361
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
3% of respondents

362
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Believe that the

363
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Was the right to

364
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Decision

365
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
In the United States

366
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
50% to be like

367
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,431
Whatever

368
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
Most affected by this

369
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
Agreed that it was

370
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
Police acted appropriately

371
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Yeah I can see

372
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
See an argument

373
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
I can understand that

374
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
They can only be had in hindsight

375
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
And so we can apply some of those lessons

376
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Futuristic

377
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
No one involved

378
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,616
Which is why

379
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
Is a good idea because everybody was really

380
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,504
Good

381
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
If you read the after-action report that the authorities all collaborated on

382
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
A lot of very valid criticism

383
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
Particularly about weapon discipline

384
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Locate

385
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
It is particularly in the case of the water

386
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,448
Shootout when they were trying to stop his car

387
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,824
Possibility

388
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Their circumstances

389
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
That the police

390
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Definitely

391
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Didn't

392
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Operate housing

393
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
But at the same time

394
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
They weren't doing it

395
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Because they were

396
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
It's more it's more expensive

397
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,232
Better training

398
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
They know not to

399
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Create

400
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Possible risk

401
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
Situation birthday

402
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Learn from this I don't want

403
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Get into

404
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
Storyville for this

405
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Specific circumstances

406
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Yeah

407
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
Operators.

408
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Hunter tips during this

409
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,992
Suspicious person carrying a package

410
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
Intuit tax

411
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
The police end up finding out

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
The taxi driver

413
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
And this immediately becomes a

414
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Huge deal

415
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
The taxi was on route

416
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,000
To the South Station

417
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,328
Which is a hub for both the mass Massachusetts Mass Transit

418
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,448
So taxi service is suspended in the city

419
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
It's determined

420
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Misspelled his name

421
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:22,368
This will not be the only time in this story that appropriate

422
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,648
Which leads me to my next flight

423
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Which is the data entry workers

424
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
Need to be respectful

425
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
And also she probably

426
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Sprouts

427
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
The day goes on

428
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
And the police keep coming up

429
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
The previous night at Pinnacle

430
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Completely chaotic

431
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,664
With a murder of a police officer

432
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,504
Request for a metropolitan area to stay indoors

433
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
The National Guard carry out their search

434
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
It's almost like a ball being set up on a t

435
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,768
He's spent his entire career talked about how fake terrorist attacks martial law

436
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
He's determined to terrorist attack

437
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
False flag

438
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
And the responses

439
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Call Marshall Law

440
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,496
No it's not even close

441
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,544
All the details

442
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,104
If there ever was a day when it felt like Alex

443
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
Begone

444
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
It should be this

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
He's literally on air while The Manhunt is going on

446
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
Well Boston is in a shelter-in-place request

447
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
Select music

448
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:37,376
Alex

449
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
Constitution

450
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,984
Lexington Green

451
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Bloomberg

452
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,104
Boston

453
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
And surrounding cities

454
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,808
He's bringing up the martial law so that's good

455
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
The Oath Keepers

456
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
Counter-protesters

457
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
And by definition counter-protesters

458
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Need permit

459
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
Constitution Alex love so much

460
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
What a group plants

461
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,408
To use public space to hold

462
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Because they're the ones

463
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
Use the public

464
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
Space for their own purposes

465
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
If a cat

466
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Something green for example

467
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,792
This was the case with the unite the right rally in Charlotte

468
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:15,168
Where is harmony of the end of white supremacy

469
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
At Justice and McGuffey Park

470
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
Which are near the park where the right-wing groups

471
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Permit

472
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
This is just simple Civic

473
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
The people counter demonstrating The Oath Keepers don't need permits because their event is really just a natural extension of The Oath Keepers

474
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
Not an event in its own right

475
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
I just heard

476
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Million right

477
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Scream

478
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
Intero in a

479
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Understand

480
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
This is not an example of favoritism

481
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
It's not Alex's mostly Focus

482
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Also

483
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm not sure if Alex is ever consulted a map

484
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Is not close to kinetic

485
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,224
I just heard a million conservatives

486
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Scream out when you said map

487
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
Crystal City

488
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Omni Atlanta

489
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Other stages

490
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
Closest probably go with New Hampshire Rhode Island

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
Close to Springfield Massachusetts

492
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
What is martial law

493
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Extending

494
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
He's really just saying something absurd

495
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,776
He might as well just say that all of New England

496
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
To try and apply

497
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Nobody

498
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
Unlocked

499
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
You can get all of it but

500
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:39,136
Connecticut is because he doesn't understand to understand

501
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,792
It's 7:15 a.m. the police received a tip about the person with a suspicious package of the taxi

502
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
They were going to South Station which includes

503
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,032
If you allowed a bomb to get there

504
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Ending

505
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
F****** transportation

506
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Part of the investigation was believed that this person got onto on the South Station

507
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
To Norwalk

508
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,464
Which was the next stop if they were able to stop

509
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
So they stop this train in Norwalk

510
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
The Metro Police

511
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Apartment search

512
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,008
There's no extension of checkpoints

513
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
The first time I've been on

514
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,176
Is all resolved by 9 a.m.

515
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
And use it to pretend that this shelter in place

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
Request the police put out extended past

517
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Austin suburbs

518
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
It's a real on 4th

519
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
They really had enough

520
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
The moving train

521
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,232
And it just turned out it was

522
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:53,632
I like

523
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,192
I don't know

524
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Good fight

525
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
So Alex

526
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,176
False flag

527
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
He's sort of

528
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
He thinks it's certainly a false Lash

529
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:22,560
It's weird but it's almost a meeting

530
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,216
Organic

531
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
Muslim terrorist

532
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
I'm all of this

533
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Do you have the grill

534
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,592
254

535
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
This was real which is strange

536
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,552
All the stuff that he sang that

537
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,304
All of the reasons that you have for that 95%

538
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Look

539
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Baby 54

540
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,616
It's weird and it's weird to hear this

541
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Unprompted

542
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:48,064
A greater possibility that it's a real event

543
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
It just got

544
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
5 times more likely

545
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
It's very strange

546
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,120
I don't know I don't understand why

547
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Functionally

548
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
Keep your difference between they're being a 1%

549
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
And a 5%.

550
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Of course not

551
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,384
He gets on to talk about how to use this whole time

552
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Covering this

553
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Add event

554
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
What does spectrum

555
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
He goes on from there and just Trails off

556
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:47,712
Could we listen to the episode from that Monday

557
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
When he was in overdrive

558
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
It was mostly a bit

559
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,160
Think this is a false flag and trying to find any little piece of information to justify

560
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:02,560
Patriots Day

561
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Annabella stats

562
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
He was not right on target

563
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Narrative

564
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
And he's doing it very sloppy

565
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,592
We just heard Alex's quote if there was a drill if they were military all around

566
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,920
The money Trail.

567
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,224
That part is of this offense

568
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
But we know what it is

569
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Exactly

570
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,416
Every single person listening to Alta show knows that without

571
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Xanax

572
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Infowars

573
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,536
And this is where deception is kind of belt

574
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,888
Because Alex knows that his audience is internalize this if-then relationship

575
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Shortcut to prove it

576
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
But something was a false

577
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Proving it heavy cloud

578
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
Create

579
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
Perception

580
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,224
Understanding this Dynamic goes a long way toward understanding why Alex is so prone to accept

581
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Bleep bulshit

582
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Would it help them get worried

583
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
To go

584
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
He has absolutely no ability to prove that the bombing was a false flag

585
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
It's just not possible

586
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,512
But his audience is accepted the implied relationship between a drill and false flag

587
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
Which I would argue he still has failed to do

588
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
This context why you accept all this

589
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,032
Completely flimsy evidence of a drill and then extrapolate that stuff out

590
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Or passed with reasonable

591
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,104
He's done this with

592
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:23,712
School safety drill in a completely different City to assert that Sandy Hook was a false flag

593
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
He's done this with a

594
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:30,112
Corporate training lecture he's pretending with a drill

595
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
Was a false flag

596
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
He does this all the time because he knows that the appearance of a drill

597
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Is enough to convince

598
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
Most of his already

599
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
It's a shortcut

600
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
That's all

601
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Long career in the

602
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
3 Bells is a little bit

603
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Annoyed

604
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Story

605
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
I'm telling you

606
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,760
You got some good ideas I don't know I think he was more the guy in the writers room was like

607
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Fine

608
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,928
He gets a with with assistance by

609
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Executive

610
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,792
Assistant executive producer credit at best

611
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
Sure

612
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
So Alex is a

613
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,216
He's convinced still no matter what they were planning on blaming right

614
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Expresses

615
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,040
Crawdaunt

616
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Wednesday

617
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:03,296
With three different host and yes it's going to be

618
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,368
Understand

619
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
You heard it here

620
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Nowhere else

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
Aria Alexander

622
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,032
Snow people

623
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
Speculate stuff

624
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
TV news programs

625
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
You know the feelings a 24-hour cycle is

626
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,160
Is it possible that

627
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
Entirely absolute

628
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
So whatever

629
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,632
This is such an example of

630
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,752
It's like say that it was going to be

631
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
So they might as well

632
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,152
F****** you-know-who

633
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
Set all the stuff George Noory on Coast to Coast AM

634
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Is also pretty worried

635
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Facebook

636
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Censorious

637
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,696
This is

638
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
Consistent to a concern of his

639
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,888
1829

640
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
What have you

641
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Pacifica 2013

642
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
Officially

643
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352
Misinformation after the boss

644
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
Isolated incident

645
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
Infowars

646
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
In the absence of official solid information

647
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
Wellfleet

648
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
People like

649
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,952
There were cottage industry conspiracy blogs over trying to drive traffic we're posting the same kind of stuff

650
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:28,192
There were people creating fake profiles for the Tsarnaev Brothers on social media

651
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
Conspiracy theories

652
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Could humans are f***** up

653
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,104
This was something is very much on the rise

654
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,480
Tons of accounts for Aurora shooter

655
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
I've been created

656
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
Some probably has jokes but some probably more malicious

657
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
NBC News reported

658
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,440
Many of these accounts are being used to spread

659
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Conspiracy theories

660
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
Another thing it was happening at the time was

661
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
Reusing fake articles about the bombing

662
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Spread spam and malware

663
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Hoping to capitalize on

664
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,984
The public's hunger for information about

665
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Cisco put out a warning

666
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,128
And warned that one of the attempts was related to an email that

667
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
From CNN

668
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
I know you want to make a phone

669
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:15,296
Biting your lip

670
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,184
You worry about you if I don't say something if you were under $0.04

671
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,256
Let me see that

672
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
B u

673
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,376
Looks like an email

674
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
With the headline

675
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
Explosions FBI benefits?

676
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
Censorship of

677
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
Conspiracy content around this time was related

678
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Texting users from these botnet

679
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
We're trying to hijack

680
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,016
In a crisis like this people who are up to no good go to work

681
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
The public really wants to know what's going on and when they're not

682
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
To cyber-attack

683
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
Do you exploit that hunger for information

684
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Get people to click on things they probably wouldn't otherwise

685
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
I'm not sure exactly what

686
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
The bigger picture of what Alex is talking

687
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
About

688
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
Definitely plenty of horrible things

689
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,968
There's a twenty-two-year-old brown University student named

690
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
PetSmart

691
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,112
I'm and he's someone who the internet decided to turn into a suspect in the bombing

692
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
In the days after the bombings

693
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
And then on April 23rd

694
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,288
The Providence River

695
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
With a subsequent autopsy the cause of death was suicide

696
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,736
I'm not aware of any evidence that the Witch Hunt was related

697
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Incense before the bomb

698
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Traumatized

699
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Terrified family

700
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Define their son

701
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,648
Facebook did not

702
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,952
Take down these posts that were

703
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Think about

704
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
These articles about

705
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
I think he's also referencing this

706
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,848
Because

707
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
The manipulative lie edited Family Guy

708
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Understand

709
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,832
I'm sure that Seth MacFarlane copyright claim

710
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Wheatley distorting

711
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
You can use copyrighted

00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,328
Material transfer

713
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Recreated thing

715
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,872
Play mix

CA is

719
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,000
Technically fair use all the f******

720
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
They are on the side of

721
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Brazen

Commentary

723
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
So it's part of the Ark

724
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
I mean

725
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
Episode

726
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,576
These articles are you saying with these Navy Seals

727
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
Resume

728
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
These rossittos based on looking at some pictures you found on Fortune

729
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,072
I'm not sure what happened with Facebook

730
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Thanks to this

731
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
You know what

732
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
I don't know

733
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,776
But if they were blocked

734
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,568
I fully support that decision

735
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:53,151
How much was engaged in targeted harassment of the people in those photos

736
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,759
It literally zero reason to suspect them of being involved in this terrorist attack outside

737
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
He was publishing articles speculating the

738
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,159
Is part of the operation

739
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
The left hundreds injured 3 Dead

740
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,023
I don't necessarily believe that Facebook blocked

741
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,559
News article

742
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
I don't care

743
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
They should have

744
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
This is as real as

745
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
If he blames

746
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:29,503
15 minutes

Is a weed story

752
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:52,287
This episode

753
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
That seems weird

754
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,527
The behavior you would expect

755
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Alex Jones

756
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
When the appearance of martial law

757
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Is the get on air

758
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
Call Alt

759
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
This should be War

760
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,767
You should be talking about how good it is

761
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Keepers are involved

762
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,071
Make the first offense

763
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Deliberate

764

Alex's entire careers

765
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
Just coming

766
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,663
That's weird well I mean

767
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
Based on what we know now

768
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
I think you realize

769
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Places that white people

770
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,295
Now that big

771
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,111
I don't I don't know

772
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
No I might be realized

773
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
This is that if he were to go

774
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
In his words

775
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
We might actually get a lot of

776
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
I think the possibility

777
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,983
The first

778
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,567
Completely legal and they do need to find the terrorist who's on the way

779
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
He knows if he doesn't

780
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,943
Key the carrying out of the investigation that God forbid

781
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,783
Like this guy blows up another building

782
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,743
Obstruction of justice

783
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
I don't think I don't think I would stay

784
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,839
Would just be a thing worth

785
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
There's a limit

786
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Maybe I don't know

787
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
I like to think there's a letter

788
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,175
Glass quarterback

789
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
Possibility

790
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
I would describe

791
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
This is a point

792
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
He's been yelling about forever

793
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Like you never have to pay up

794
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,559
Chickens coming home to roost

795
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,935
He's been millions of dollars rambling about how is the government ever got out of line images Patriot bodies

796
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,311
He was safe to do this because I'm sure he never imagined something like this would have

797
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,639
But now it is the appearance of it

798
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
And heavily armed police are searching houses door-to-door

799
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
And people are being asked

800
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
To stay indoors

801
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
In order for Alex to stay in anyway

802
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,159
He has to call for armed resistance

803
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
And he really doesn't want to do that

804
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
News ratings are way up

805
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Like to keep that going

806
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,423
Resist

807
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,751
The police officers trying to find the surviving Boston bombing suspect

808
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,847
Probably your nose to spite your face conversation

809
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
I suspect but cannot prove

810
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
He found his narrative this is a false flag

811
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Traffic

812
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
Descending on the city.

813
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Play into his narrative

814
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
It's also too much

815
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,375
Do be very difficult for him to engage with the story how he normally would

816
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Without it being too

817
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
To the point that I wear

818
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
I'm not something you just can't afford to do as a business

819
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Because in his

820
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
Literally it is

821
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
Appearance of

822
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
Exactly these

823
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
Sequence of events

824
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
It is literally I

825
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:19,903
Grease police

826
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,487
There's a

827
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,791
That means

828
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:32,191
2

829
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
Blow up

830
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Alex's

831
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,639
Globalist

832
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,223
Cannot ever actually start

833
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,295
Always be about

834
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
Always be making

835
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
Kinder move

836
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,207
They actually be doing the martial law

837
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,767
The in-between state

838
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
Because if the stories of martial law

839
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,935
Should tell that it's time to start shooting

840
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
I think Alex wants to

841
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
Foster this image but it's

842
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Stave off

843
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,407
Tuckaway fraud

844
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,479
The only

845
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,039
Exclamation

846
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Those possibilities

847
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
Because

848
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,183
Someone who presents himself

849
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,255
In every contact that I've heard

850
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
They only only

851
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Possibility

852
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
Is that he realizes

853
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
Too hot

854
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,007
And his behavior

855
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,079
He thinks the negative effect is

856
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
That's debatable

857
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Yeah

858
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
I see you being like

859
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
This is too hot

860
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,183
I could lose a lot of money

861
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
Movie traffic

862
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:12,287
Did now the time to get kicked off air is now

863
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,783
I do feel that

864
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
Sincere because

865
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
What he wants to do instead is just

866
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Keep talking about

867
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
The same shape

868
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
But he found on 4chan

869
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,775
Change the game

870
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,695
It's going to come out

871
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,231
Forget it

872
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
What

873
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
Same

874
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
Obviously

875
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:38,559
Everyone listening to our show

876
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
Is just based on his fantasies

877
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,399
Constructed pictures.

878
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
None of this is real

879
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
It merits pointing out

880
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,871
Alex has no idea any of the people in the picture

881
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
Cuz you thought were actually Muslims

882
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:58,015
All he knows is that they're not white people possibly of Middle Eastern descent

883
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,343
He has no reason to believe the people in these images

884
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
Fortuner followers of Islam

885
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
DC's brown people in the picture

886
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Which to me is bad

887
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
Yeah I mean

888
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
One good part

889
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
Like luxury of other ring

890
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,703
The other is so big

891
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Just called the other whatever you want

892
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:25,407
Anybody in those pictures turned out to actually be Muslim is kind of irrelevant to Alex's

893
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,223
Assumption

894
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
If they aren't now they were

895
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Narrative is based on

896
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,391
Imagine about people in these pictures

897
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,695
Easy brown people they must be Muslim

898
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,279
Easy white guy he must be a redneck 88 who's been brought in to be the Patsy

899
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,119
Guys in uniforms they must be Navy Seals mercenary group

900
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:49,215
Not one single thing about these people in these photos is actually substantiate

901
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
It's just taken

902
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Because Alex is absurdity

903
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
To be true

904
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,967
When we talked about Alex not knowing the difference between reality and fiction it's usually in the context of him thinking that movie scene or

905
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
That's definitely place where the attendance

906
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,295
She is most pronounced

907
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,111
But it's important to remember that this exists in other

908
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:11,231
Here he's written a complete fiction about some pictures he saw that he found out 4chan

909
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
Any experience is that as real

910
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,375
It's almost like an author falling in love with a character in a novel

911
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
They're writing

912
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
He either knows he

913
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,495
He's doing this and willfully misleading

914
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,311
Accepting his fiction is reality for his own profit

915
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Which would make him a psychopath

916
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
Or he has no idea

917
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
He's doing that

918
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,479
People which means he needs serious help

919
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
Regardless of the explanation

920
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,087
Someone should have intervened in Alex's like long ago

921
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
It's real

922
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Balmert

923
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
These signs

924
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,463
These warning signs

925
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Clear

926
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,911
Imagine

927
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
Someone in his life not being like this

928
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
F***** up

929
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Now it's working

930
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
I can't imagine

931
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
I mean if you're anything other than

932
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
You could

933
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
Rationalize away all

934
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
If you didn't have a

935
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Active life

936
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,671
Consistent point of view regarding everything

937
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Can you Saturday

938
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
Tracking it over

939
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Just be like

940
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,119
Coming in and out needs a nonsense like a movie and relax

941
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,191
I don't think the most

942
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Like in that movie

943
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
That junk

944
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,407
I don't think that most people who would have any interest

945
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
And critically looking at

946
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,879
Write a lot of its life

947
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
People listening or passive or

948
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,743
You know these signs just get mess

949
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,095
Either a willful

950
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,935
Attempts to get people to accept an alternate reality

951
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Inability to know what's real

952
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
Either option

953
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Is pretty

954
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
Some little points that he bring

955
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Wingstop

956
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,015
Again

957
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Much

958
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
Going on talking about

959
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
Situation of the shelter in

960
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,519
He's leaving Lexington Green

961
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,503
That's the first reference to the shootout from the night before

962
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
Only

963
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Referencing it vague

964
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,791
I can find no evidence

965
00:53:54,047 --> 00:54:00,191
Definitely didn't but I'm saying that I can't find any trace of the story on the aps website

966
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239
Archived versions of the sites

967
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
From the time

968
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,823
I don't know what the reality is here but I have every reason to

969
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,383
Believe Alex is just kind of

970
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,039
Later someone attempts to correct Alex that what happened was that the police were warning

971
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Before at the shootout in Watertown

972
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,671
There was an active shooting going on

973
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
This is very different

974
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
Police threatening to shoot

975
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,327
Reporters definitely sounds like

976
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
Police threatened to shoot report

977
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
If you stick around

978
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,615
In this circumstance if Trump was

979
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
Police Commissioner whatever

980
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,943
I would still.

981
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Because

982
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:48,575
It is a legitimate warning than 8 minutes

983
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:54,975
Ibiza police

984
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
Misunderstanding a misrepresentation of

985
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,311
A reporter that I heard of

986
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,895
Clip is a really good encapsulation

987
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
Is dealing with the supposed martial law

988
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,551
He touches on it for a second but only to use it as a way to amplify

989
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,135
Talk about The Oath Keepers can't have a permit

990
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,671
We're happy globalist want your gun

991
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Those are safe topics

992
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Turn to stay on

993
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,303
Because

994
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,631
The Oath Keepers are obviously still having a rally in Noah

995
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,399
Stop them

996
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Taking anyone's gun

997
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Totally fine to agitate

998
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
You're only

999
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Creating

1000
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,079
Hypothetical extension

1001
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
Martial law

1002
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,111
YouTube very quickly end up advocating violence of

1003
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
The police

1004
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
It's a real sign of cowardice what he's doing

1005
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,999
Clear indication

1006
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
If you believe half the s*** he yells about on his show

1007
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
This would be a put-up-or-shut-up moment

1008
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
Just decided to change the subject

1009
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,287
But I'd be surprised

1010
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,871
Nobody called in

1011
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
Call Dan

1012
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
The related to the shootout for the night

1013
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Before

1014
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Replace request

1015
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,767
But it's not

1016
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
It's it's weird

1017
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
Crazy

1018
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:47,103
It's if you're saying there's more

1019
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,383
You said it's time

1020
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Start swinging

1021
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,199
There are some crazy

1022
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
Okay

1023
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
So Alex

1024
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
Stewie brings up the shootout

1025
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,839
Before but

1026
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
The gun stop

1027
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,727
Stuart roads the head of the

1028
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,311
Show

1029
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,479
Stupid

1030
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,551
Ceremony

1031
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
In their conversation

1032
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Store Road Selma

1033
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
Super f***** up there

1034
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
Cupquake

1035
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
Roses

1036
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
Complete lunatic

1037
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,455
Check if you think so

1038
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,575
Please whatever preference solution

1039
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,879
It didn't happen so we can only guess

1040
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
People called 911

1041
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:49,471
500

1042
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
Authorized so the people who

1043
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
You know they were calling

1044
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
LaRosa's

1045
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Jesus Christ

1046
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Think about much more concrete version

1047
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,743
Honda fault. Spector got floated by the internet

1048
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
People felt emboldened

1049
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
One of those people might have been killed

1050
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Absolute

1051
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,447
It's almost a miracle that no civilians

1052
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,983
Were killed as is

1053
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
In The Manhunt and everything

1054
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
The police after Action Report make

1055
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,639
Makes very strong points

1056
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
Needed

1057
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,223
Was the weapons

1058
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,551
And the late-night chudat Watertown

1059
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
There was a crossfire

1060
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Situation that got created

1061
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,951
After johar Got Away an erroneous report of a stolen truck was called

1062
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,047
Police shooting at when they spotted it

1063
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:50,399
No one was hurt and it turned out the people in the truck were off-duty police

1064
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,679
Stride

1065
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:58,079
Terrifying what could have happened but resolved as well

1066
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,783
Signs of Life

1067
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,623
You talk about

1068
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:17,535
Resident historian have

1069
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:23,423
I've never gotten a realize we set this up or lie cuz I don't feel good as a line pressure

1070
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
These were

1071
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:34,431
It strains credulity to imagine that would take possibly would be any more disciplined

1072
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
I think this is a bad solution

1073
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,039
Especially not one so f****** trigger-happy is

1074
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Oathkeeper

1075
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:46,463
I want nothing less in life for Stewart Road style Posse to be empowered to

1076
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
Enforce the law

1077
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,303
Picking Lily up to the point of using lethal Force

1078
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
That's legitimately the stuff

1079
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:57,727
Contention that this was happening in Texas

1080
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
I beg to differ

1081
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,615
2018 twenty-three-year-old Mark Condit carried out a string of bomb

1082
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
His first bombing was on March 2nd

1083
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,527
Serial bombings

1084
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
21st

1085
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
Is Reign of Terror

1086
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Because I'm old

1087
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,903
Keep a rounded up the boys and went hunting

1088
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
It was because police did a thorough

1089
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,487
Navigation and track

1090
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,583
Their unsuccessful as he detonated a bomb

1091
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Bring a cop

1092
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,471
Vigilante activity did literally nothing

1093
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,543
Help

1094
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,383
Nor did Alex's lunatic ravings about it all being

1095
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
False flag

1096
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
So I guess

1097
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,783
Just proves Alex's we would have taken care of

1098
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,343
Nonsense

1099
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Children playing

1100
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
Cowboys in India

1101
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Got hurt

1102
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Probably

1103
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
F****** group

1104
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Children

1105
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
Awful

1106
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,239
It is awful

1107
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
I have so much power

1108
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,895
Stewart

1109
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Advocating

1110
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Straight up

1111
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,479
Vigilante Posse

1112
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,271
You are as a preferable solution

1113
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
I cannot imagine

1114
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:21,695
A year later if you pulled that flavor

1115
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
I would guess

1116
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,047
You guys feel that

1117
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:30,911
Handled the night of Terror as we know it now 17

1118
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,519
10% says it was a good idea the rest of us

1119
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
Did you enjoy the

1120
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,639
Flimsy rationalization

1121
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
24-hours

1122
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
White people murdered

1123
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,063
So keep in mind in this next clip the city of Boston

1124
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
As well

1125
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
Pretty messed up

1126
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
Situation

1127
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
Everybody's

1128
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Struggling

1129
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Is also having a

1130
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
Like

1131
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
You know that Noah was going to arrest

1132
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,279
This is just

1133
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,935
Milking it for all it's worth

1134
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,031
This is that

1135
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
Pizza place in the

1136
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,895
Jakpus obit

1137
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,711
I was just coming all over the place

1138
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
F****** ID

1139
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,135
Alex

1140
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
And his belief that this is

1141
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
False flag

1142
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,583
I need expecting Stewart's going to be like yeah absolutely

1143
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,119
Little bit

1144
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
That's crazy

1145
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,607
I don't like

1146
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
Close this is why

1147
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,567
Why I say that they're alive

1148
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
There are unexpected line

1149
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
People have

1150
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,943
Never know how to predict what they are

1151
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Like Alex

1152
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:56,319
It's probably would feel guilty if

1153
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
A building be blown up

1154
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Now public

1155
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:12,191
I never would have guessed it still roads it's been like I have no idea who these people are

1156
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,799
You're literally Advocate going around

1157
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
You know your neighborhood you know who's not supposed to

1158
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
Be there

1159
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:29,855
Are you talkin about how are you going to identify who's not supposed to be there if I don't

1160
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
Why are weird

1161
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,975
I don't know I don't know what to make of it

1162
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,255
Please will you skin color

1163
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:47,007
In this next clip we finally have the younger bombers

1164
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,311
Alex

1165
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
The first time that he says it

1166
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,575
Under martial law

1167
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,519
We just Incredibles

1168
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,183
Like this is about a couple times

1169
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
Cities under martial law

1170
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Do you expect

1171
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,839
Getting into it

1172
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,375
Yeah not just

1173
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,655
Straight

1174
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:51,263
Is on the way to other topics

1175
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Martial law

1176
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Entire careers

1177
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
City goes under Mars

1178
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Signal

1179
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:58,943
I'll take over the country

1180
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,991
So far it's not just like

1181
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,783
Oh yeah Boston's under martial law

1182
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,111
You're right

1183
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Verily

1184
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Alright

1185
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,743
Let's not panic about this

1186
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,535
This is a temporary lawn Forest

1187
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,607
Activity Beyond The Realm

1188
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Acceptable

1189
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
What we need to focus

1190
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,935
Is that this is a

1191
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
The trial run

1192
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,983
Or something like that

1193
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,799
Martial law

1194
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,383
And I'm certain that that is where Alex will land eventually

1195
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
But you would expect that would be

1196
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Because he needs to cover this

1197
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
It's just like I said

1198
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:38,367
Aside I mean Trey mentioned

1199
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,255
In the movie

1200
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:50,399
He woke up early that day that the time to ruminate

1201
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Before it gets too

1202
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
Right

1203
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:58,079
His work is actually just reading negative articles

1204
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,831
Demonic

1205
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
Navy Seals

1206
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,223
As a six series

1207
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
David

1208
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,415
What is this

1209
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Contracting

1210
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,823
The people who backpack

1211
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Call Dad

1212
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
Football game

1213
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Occupation news

1214
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,111
On the internet that is now starting

1215
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
Haseeb into Alex's

1216
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
Conversation about it

1217
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,791
David Knight is been more on this prior to the

1218
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Itself

1219
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,423
Just for context is irrelevant

1220
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:05,567
It may seem like a little minor slip up at Alex try to refute that La time story with the Washington

1221
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:09,663
End times headline and he tries to pass off as a Washington Post

1222
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Edline

1223
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,783
But if you know what these papers are that looks less like a mistake and more like sleight of hand

1224
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,111
Washington Post is a mainstream media paper

1225
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,183
Publishing an article speculating

1226
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,231
These Craft International agents at the marathon

1227
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,535
It lends things a bit more credibility

1228
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
Which is exactly what

1229
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,863
Story

1230
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
But the story to make it to the wapo it would need to pass layers of Ed

1231
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Conversely the wash

1232
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,615
Completely untrustworthy

1233
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
The cult leader Reverend Sun Myung Moon

1234
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,479
Boone said I found at the Washington Times

1235
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
Expression of my love for America

1236
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,111
Who seek to establish America in New Providence

1237
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:53,183
That's that's

1238
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
Formosa

1239
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
The fourth estate

1240
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,815
I'm pretty sure that's how they all started

1241
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,839
These intentions

1242
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,167
Concretely translator

1243
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,639
In its early days the paper was mainly about how great the Cold War was

1244
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:18,271
South America

1245
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
You can see why Alex

1246
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
It's a good source

1247
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,511
He comes from an insane John Birch Society

1248
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
Credible

1249
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:37,471
He knows that most people look at the times as unreliable

1250
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,031
Post

1251
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,615
It doesn't make Alex look better to appeal to a Time

1252
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,895
But it does

1253
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
The post

1254
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
That's why you said that the washing

1255
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
The post headline

1256
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,087
And lets out a big sigh

1257
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
What do you realize is it the Washington time

1258
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
Story

1259
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
That's a sigh of disappointment

1260
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,999
Doesn't have the msf

1261
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,279
He was building up to

1262
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
Telling

1263
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
It's also pretty

1264
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
Pretty brilliant

1265
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Reacting in the moment

1266
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,031
To be like

1267
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
Because that makes

1268
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Do you like all the mistakes

1269
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
I don't have time

1270
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,431
Now to pull up the post right

1271
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Times article

1272
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,295
I'm just going to reference the one that I have

1273
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,183
Front of me he doesn't repeatedly

1274
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,047
The Times article

1275
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,887
He's sort of spinning his wheels

1276
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,495
Percent chance that this is a real terrorist attack

1277
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Said that it was a real

1278
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Then we

1279
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,735
7

1280
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:55,295
Hundred percent

1281
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,927
I'm not going to do I don't know the number exactly

1282
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Nuisance

1283
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
They didn't not guilty

1284
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,615
No

1285
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,967
Next

1286
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,783
Some questions cuz he didn't say like we got the truth

1287
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
When we plugged

1288
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Infowars

1289
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,023
We plugged you should have seen them so scared when we plug

1290
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Infowars

1291
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,839
They were so guilty

1292
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
It's

1293
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
This is all

1294
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
Just PR

1295
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
That's that

1296
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,727
Understand

1297
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,519
But it's not a greater truth

1298
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
Is out it's more eyes are on me

1299
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Beloved

1300
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
So unfortunately he doesn't have a big

1301
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Staff at this point

1302
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,271
Epson one of the other employees Wiki

1303
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
Remember who it is

1304
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,183
I wonder what that f****** thing is

1305
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Fewer employees

1306
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Fairly well

1307
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,351
As opposed to not being able to play any of his clothes

1308
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:49,727
I think he's running also

1309
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,775
But you still doing it as a radio amp

1310
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,103
Million-dollar

1311
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,039
I think a lot of people

1312
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Alex

1313
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,183
Like

1314
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,279
Pretty confident you haven't

1315
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
He's

1316
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,423
Unfortunately because of the spin. Staff

1317
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,471
California

1318
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
Eric dykes

1319
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
Melissa Melton

1320
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Just left

1321
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
Just start their own

1322
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
Offshoot

1323
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
Operation

1324
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
Paul Joseph Watson

1325
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,391
Tired as hell

1326
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,119
Play a special report of hers

1327
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
Yeah it's really weird

1328
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
Probably a number people to work it enforced go through

1329
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
I think in the early

1330
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,183
They're doing something real

1331
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,975
30 plays that report is like

1332
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Damn that didn't feel like Infowars

1333
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:23,679
The finger at Obama in a context that is

1334
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:30,079
Sharks are bad

1335
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,127
It seemed to be largely about

1336
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:36,991
You're saying that we Precision Target at

1337
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
What is going on here

1338
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
That's wild

1339
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,879
Eclipse

1340
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,975
Demonstrate

1341
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
It's very strange because

1342
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,119
The day before on the 8th

1343
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
She was the one who came up with the different color fact

1344
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,311
Brilliant

1345
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,871
Special Report

1346
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:14,111
Different colored backpacks

1347
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:20,767
We got a beat out the whole journalistic Integrity after overtime

1348
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,839
There's no standards

1349
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
Whatever

1350
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:26,399
He doesn't have

1351
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
To cut

1352
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
Clips

1353
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,007
But he's seen in the news

1354
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,823
Is the beginning

1355
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
Of the narrative

1356
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:52,767
Eclipse coming up

1357
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,143
Chris Matthews

1358
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,679
Photos of baby seals

1359
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:11,359
George Noory

1360
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
Am Coast-to-Coast episode

1361
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:22,367
I don't I don't know I don't care

1362
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Is normal

1363
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,439
They were going to blame this white

1364
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:27,999
Option

1365
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,839
You saying all along

1366
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,679
This is a

1367
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,215
Fundamental change

1368
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
It is narrative

1369
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
Because that dude

1370
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,847
Is not a military

1371
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
Is route

1372
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Pictures that are necessarily

1373
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Well you know what the

1374
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,039
Mistake was

1375
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,343
So they only said Navy Seals

1376
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,671
In order for the Navy Seals

1377
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
State five times

1378
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,631
Whatever is going on is a fundamental shift

1379
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
On does a lot of the

1380
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,567
Baby seals

1381
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
2 take away

1382
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,920
I need to get the military in line

1383
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,968
Call whatever

1384
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Sure

1385
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:26,368
Listening to the show is like how

1386
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
Disjoint

1387
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,280
The problem for the earlier days

1388
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
Certainly

1389
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,840
Different narrative

1390
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
Being sold

1391
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,568
His narrative

1392
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Amorphous

1393
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Is blob that is

1394
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
Just like cert

1395
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,688
Parts just expand

1396
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
Come back in and then another party

1397
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Expands images

1398
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:57,600
Rolling around in roustabout little holes

1399
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,160
It's like that shows that Stephen Colbert

1400
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,304
People with no bone

1401
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,840
Bonobos

1402
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
Stop playing to setup

1403
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
The Marine

1404
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:19,360
He's also decided that the people that

1405
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:23,712
Blippi talks about how they should reach out to craft International

1406
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:29,856
He claims that they already tried to call them he's discussing this makes me think he has not

1407
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,672
Minecraft

1408
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,968
Officially

1409
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,320
Doing all this work right now

1410
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
Can you say again

1411
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,952
Haven't called

1412
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,024
Before they were just giving him a nice call

1413
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
See if they want to go

1414
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:14,144
Officially say we are

1415
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Is every would like

1416
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,800
It doesn't seem like they've called

1417
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:27,968
Get to the phone to call craft but they didn't even make it all the way to the phone you could say that

1418
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
Tried

1419
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:38,720
Formality to life

1420
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
Return call

1421
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
Alex

1422
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Express

1423
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
It doesn't feel real

1424
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Alex

1425
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
A comment

1426
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,920
And as we learned from the last time you tried to do this. Raise its really fast

1427
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,040
He tries to read

1428
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,576
By saying I really agree with it

1429
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Ghana

1430
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
Weird

1431
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
Weird, I got weird

1432
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,536
Weird the case with pretty much all,

1433
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
I don't agree with that

1434
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,728
Write off

1435
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
The combat

1436
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,104
Find his comments anymore they're all gone

1437
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
Everyone

1438
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Ethiopia

1439
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,600
No it we we don't know

1440
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Big B

1441
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,952
You can be you can hear that and hear him say I don't agree with that

1442
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
Indicative of being like they're going to be

1443
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:21,376
He's disagreeing with the fundamentalist some

1444
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
And this is part of the pivoting of the narrative

1445
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
Because

1446
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,400
We need your help

1447
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,936
You need more staff

1448
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:03,872
The thing about this is planning to blame the fields or at least they talked about

1449
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,152
What do you base

1450
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
Baton

1451
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:09,760
Conversations with anyone

1452
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
Of course

1453
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
He's trying to say that he's

1454
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Conversation

1455
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,952
Because I didn't hear them

1456
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
Which means

1457
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
Obviously

1458
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
If you reverse engineer it

1459
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,656
Six months ago they said if we were going to

1460
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
What age is

1461
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Brilliance

1462
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,384
And I think it's probably accidental

1463
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,920
But what is brilliant

1464
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Is putting it on his

1465
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Audience

1466
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
2

1467
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,528
Put those clips together

1468
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
Instead of

1469
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
Having to do it himself

1470
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,624
If you don't get it

1471
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
And if you do

1472
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,952
Play those clips in that sewer working on it

1473
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,584
We can permanently be like the audience

1474
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,144
Kansas putting it together whenever

1475
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,288
It's now they're playing

1476
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,360
Just put the pieces together and we are moving forward

1477
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,432
Call

1478
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,480
That is so horrible

1479
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,368
Which is setting it right now

1480
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
So physically sick

1481
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,896
What's your name

1482
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
What's her name

1483
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,272
Expert

1484
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,552
Erin Burnett

1485
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,000
I will say that I can neither confirm nor do

1486
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,560
Deny that Erin Burnett

1487
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,520
Listening to right now

1488
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
The night before

1489
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:24,160
It seems very unlikely to be discussing the possibility

1490
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,464
After the photos

1491
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,256
And they're clearly both pretty young

1492
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
That's the type of

1493
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,560
That you would do on info

1494
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
I guess it's

1495
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,632
Impossible

1496
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,032
Maybe I'll press conference

1497
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,688
I don't know if

1498
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
What's a sarong

1499
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Anyways

1500
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
And

1501
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
AR

1502
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Wild

1503
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,696
The first guy that you talk to you want to talk about the white packs

1504
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,488
And pictures

1505
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,168
Poor looking guy

1506
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,824
Actually matches his straps that he's got over his arms

1507
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,016
Right right

1508
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:25,856
If you actually had a bag that you brought with you

1509
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:28,160
Terraria

1510
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,616
Thought experiment

1511
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
The marathon

1512
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,016
Do you think for a single second that Alex

1513
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:58,112
Take a second look at a picture of a man carrying backpack

1514
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,648
Do you think that rises

1515
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,696
Level of Suspicion

1516
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,632
Man I'm really trying to find a funny way to say yes but it really doesn't it is nothing

1517
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:16,288
There's nothing realize that the graphics one

1518
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,896
Split-second into consideration and doesn't tell you anything about what happened

1519
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,712
If there hadn't been a bombing you just see that

1520
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,272
Any number of innocuous explanation would make sense

1521
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,552
Maybe

1522
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:36,768
Friends also

1523
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:39,072
You prepare to take something out of your backpack

1524
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:45,472
Maybe he just seen that Lionel was trying to

1525
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Stop the video.

1526
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Taking off his back

1527
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,224
There's literally nothing suspicious about a person caring

1528
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:05,696
Down by the police

1529
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:11,840
Could we imagine Alex in this alternative reality

1530
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:17,728
These two guys are talking about the single

1531
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,056
When is it didn't happen they do most certainly be opposed to it

1532
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,592
Books

1533
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,360
Weird

1534
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
And you're going to search him

1535
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,176
It doesn't make any sense

1536
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
These people are still

1537
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,296
Sprite very very

1538
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
There's more

1539
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,392
These guys apparently Maybe

1540
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:40,512
Community College entry-level psychology

1541
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,840
About psychology

1542
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,400
Because they decide to psychoanalyze the guy

1543
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
I would rather than

1544
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
Body language

1545
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,480
Exactly

1546
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:10,720
Not good I don't know he looks ashamed

1547
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,816
Your honor I was not ashamed at the time and this is

1548
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Harshly earned by Sia

1549
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,704
Said that I looked at

1550
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,824
I think the larger picture of what they're doing with this guy is death

1551
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,360
Currently not appropriate

1552
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,920
At least a third of a judge

1553
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,456
My call like I think one look

1554
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
Ashamed

1555
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
What

1556
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,296
Dick is

1557
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,904
Wild

1558
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:43,744
Okay babe

1559
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
Another

1560
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,328
It comes up with calls

1561
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,376
Is a new piece of

1562
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,144
The narrative

1563
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,704
The Marines were going to

1564
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:01,152
Not blaming

1565
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:07,552
If you just think that there's a hundred different Patxi's there

1566
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:15,488
Mint Marine

1567
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:21,120
He was there in case they wanted to go with the redneck

1568
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,936
Purpose in case they wanted

1569
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,776
Crazy the Old Country Buffet of Patsy

1570
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Yeah

1571
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,152
Prioritizing

1572
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
The Marine

1573
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,528
He is under lockdown

1574
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,832
They're on the shelter in place order

1575
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:45,184
There's a new there's a new wrinkle that's going to start development

1576
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
TV Guide

1577
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,024
Theron pictures everywhere

1578
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:58,496
They're saying that just in case

1579
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,056
Can make a difference actually speaks out

1580
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,128
A look at all these Navy Seals everywhere

1581
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
That's another way for me no mainstream media to cover their butt

1582
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Yeah

1583
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,464
Beginning of a colonel

1584
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,864
What's going on with these

1585
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
Cease right now

1586
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,776
Appreciate that

1587
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,312
A certain kind of stupid first

1588
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,640
Can have a conversation that I would have high sober

1589
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:40,992
Baha'i

1590
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,832
Is under martial law

1591
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
It's not

1592
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,960
There haven't been so many passes

1593
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,264
All imaginary

1594
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:19,904
Throughout their how many people died in the internet decided to blame for this

1595
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Which makes you think

1596
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,792
We shouldn't have a bunch of

1597
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:29,632
Don't like all this stuff again

1598
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,872
Roads on earlier

1599
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,432
Vigilante

1600
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
Justice

1601
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
I got

1602
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,112
Complete without

1603
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,160
From gunownersofamerica on

1604
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:58,560
Support himself

1605
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
Perspective

1606
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:07,520
Martial law

1607
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,944
Surprise

1608
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:24,416
Boo

1609
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,000
Good good stuff Larry

1610
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,072
It's

1611
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:31,840
That's broke

1612
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,424
We assumed that it was going to be

1613
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
They were going to plant

1614
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
So they could

1615
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:38,752
Steeler

1616
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,056
But what

1617
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
Oh my glob

1618
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,408
Cuz they just do that

1619
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,200
F*** are you talking about

1620
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:51,552
Friday episode

1621
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,928
No that's awful and it sucks

1622
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,488
To hear it sucks that people act that way

1623
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
You go back to 2013

1624
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,096
These are the same ideas

1625
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
That has been underlined

1626
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:10,496
Gaston the people in Alex is orbit

1627
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
Totally totally totally practice

1628
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Coming on here

1629
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:19,968
We should have a Muslim just blow stuff up

1630
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,808
We shouldn't have a war with them

1631
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,368
They just

1632
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:31,232
Weather schedule

1633
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,768
It's a very

1634
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,048
Locked up

1635
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,096
Position

1636
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:41,216
The ability to episode

1637
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
Begone

1638
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,592
Euro

1639
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,992
Exile we're going to

1640
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:59,136
Wants to build up more this idea that the Marines and the Navy Seals were there

1641
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
People who work

1642
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
You know what

1643
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,792
I was looking at those pictures

1644
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
They looks

1645
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
Apprised

1646
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,744
Maybe it's a former military

1647
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
What is that

1648
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,824
It's shifting everything is change

1649
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,384
This is where it really comes

1650
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,152
Together

1651
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
Alex gets a call

1652
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
From a guy who thinks

1653
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,992
The shelter in place

1654
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,528
Request

1655
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,088
It's very weird

1656
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,112
Unusual

1657
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,696
And we need an explanation for Wyatt

1658
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464
Actually have

1659
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
No no no no

1660
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
That's what they want you to say

1661
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,032
Globalist

1662
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,760
The city of Boston effectively shut down all the transit

1663
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
Everything

1664
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,136
Something is in place

1665
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Yeah

1666
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
This is

1667
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
Thrown out

1668
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
Suggestion

1669
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,264
Whistleblower

1670
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:57,664
Bald eagles

1671
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,248
No you're right

1672
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,600
Around killing all these people

1673
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,136
That could blow the whistle

1674
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,928
Vigilant

1675
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,976
Now when I heard that

1676
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Crazy

1677
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:15,328
First of all

1678
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
Suggesting

1679
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,912
We'll see how it goes for the rest of the show

1680
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:26,080
Becky has come back

1681
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,616
It does

1682
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,944
Weird movies

1683
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,528
Oh my God it's

1684
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:39,648
It's introduced in the context of being

1685
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
As we go through

1686
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,976
Through this episode you'll see it become more like

1687
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
Bad idea

1688
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,632
But he hasn't

1689
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216
To give a shout out

1690
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
Dan badonde

1691
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,312
And Alex reveal something

1692
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,640
Look good for him

1693
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:11,392
Release the Kraken

1694
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,208
The fact that is not funny at all

1695
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,768
Release the Kraken

1696
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,536
The movie clash of

1697
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,608
It's a common catchphrase that people use

1698
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,656
It is always

1699
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,936
The context of sending it

1700
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
And an offense

1701
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,240
It's a weapon

1702
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Is twofold

1703
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,616
The first thing is actually pretty in Port

1704
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
Baby covers

1705
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,856
In his deposition about a Sandy Hook

1706
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,000
Official

1707
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:52,608
But this clip really seems to suggest that he is an instrument

1708
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,936
They have a Target and they sent him out to do what he does

1709
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:02,080
The second thing this reveals is it Alex

1710
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,640
It's tantamount to releasing a destructive weapon

1711
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
Going out to ask question

1712
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,784
He's a mythical Beast who's completely uncontrollable

1713
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,832
Is letting loose on people

1714
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:14,368
Namely the citizens of Boston

1715
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,392
Hook

1716
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
He's not fake laughing bear

1717
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
He has his collar about calling

1718
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,584
The Kraken

1719
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:28,192
He loves that he can throw a grenade at these people explode from a safe distance

1720
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,264
This illustrates a cruel and sadistic streak

1721
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,104
Can Alex give a s*** about the

1722
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
UNIF

1723
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,432
Alex

1724
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:42,016
But not somebody who he really

1725
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,784
Capacity

1726
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,344
I really hate that bhadoti and I hope

1727
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,368
Really ashamed

1728
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,392
I'm sorry for what he's done

1729
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,720
But you trying to can't help but feel a little bit bad for him

1730
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
Hughley using

1731
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:56,096
I don't feel that bad though

1732
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
I've lost

1733
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:04,544
Alex come on

1734
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:10,432
Candy when they're not enabling you there

1735
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,224
All of this is awful and then

1736
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:14,784
Somebody else

1737
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:15,808
I'm just like

1738
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
Betty's

1739
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,672
You know it's like these people just do

1740
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,256
The game

1741
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:29,632
Play Choice it's not like some kind of ingrained

1742
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,424
Behavior that they've learned

1743
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,544
Absolutely

1744
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,336
To it it's tough to feel

1745
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,616
That bad

1746
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,712
But at the same time you know you got to still stay in touch with your human insta

1747
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,504
And someone being used

1748
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,528
Is not good

1749
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,064
So

1750
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:52,416
I would I choose to do in a case like this

1751
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:54,464
Instinctually

1752
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,488
I feel a little bit of

1753
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,024
The pity for Danica.

1754
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
Because he's

1755
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,864
Queenly willingly

1756
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,936
An awful way towards vulnerable breathing people

1757
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:08,032
I choose to transmute PD into disgust towards Alex

1758
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:14,432
I hate batondy bad for him

1759
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,248
Haggar

1760
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:21,856
Realign

1761
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,160
Call from a guy inbox

1762
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,952
And Alex wants to know if he thinks

1763
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,720
False flag

1764
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,536
As a Bostonian what's your got on this

1765
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,072
False flag

1766
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,704
Probably not

1767
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:53,344
But I'm going to be

1768
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,048
Obviously

1769
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:06,400
Part of the plan, but I'm going to Badger you

1770
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:12,032
I'm not sure if it goes that far but he is going to Badger the people who disagree

1771
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
Not fun

1772
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,616
Next clip

1773
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:19,456
Just talking about the

1774
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,992
Amex

1775
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,016
Crucial mistake

1776
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,040
And how we discuss

1777
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,600
Happy family

1778
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,584
Interested

1779
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,400
So here's another weirdo

1780
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,384
His main complaints

1781
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,200
Scale

1782
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:54,016
Jordan that's a huge problem

1783
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
Regardless

1784
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Any sense

1785
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:02,976
Naturally raises the question of what size area is

1786
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:06,048
Too large for the police

1787
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,680
Alex says here that he thinks it's okay on one block presumably because the police would have narrowed down their swords

1788
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,288
Good reason

1789
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,824
Suspect that the suspect is in

1790
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,360
What's the substitute of differin

1791
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,224
Used to justify and the other not

1792
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,040
I will I will give you a very clear

1793
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,112
The suburbs

1794
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,184
And we're not going to worry too much about the

1795
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,744
Inner-city black

1796
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
If you know what I mean

1797
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:42,912
Actually introduced another issue is it different

1798
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,448
Rocks will be different

1799
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
Your

1800
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,776
Arbitrary

1801
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,568
The definition

1802
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,360
This being okay

1803
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
Miners are with just made

1804
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,224
Like what type of block are we dealing with

1805
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,552
And they've split up

1806
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,856
Can you send brought in the area

1807
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:05,184
If one suspect being traced justifies one block

1808
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,208
Being locked out

1809
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,512
Police telling people not blocked stay indoors

1810
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,864
The two suspects justifies an additional lockdown right

1811
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:21,056
It has to be one terrorist per block

1812
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
Okay

1813
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:28,480
Set off bombs

1814
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,808
What if you're not sure if they're working with

1815
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,136
Qualifies them to be considered

1816
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Linda Bostic

1817
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:37,440
Extreme Measures

1818
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:41,792
My point is made of form of martial law

1819
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,072
And from that point

1820
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,096
Completely lost

1821
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,376
Any kind of grounding

1822
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
Can stand on

1823
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:49,216
If you were against the police acted this way under any

1824
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:57,664
I could disagree with him and say that I believe that there are occasions where the public could possibly do things that are uncomfortable to

1825
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Themselves

1826
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,480
Personally

1827
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:03,296
But I couldn't say like Aur

1828
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,112
Made a mistake

1829
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,208
What's Alex

1830
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,488
You completely

1831
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:14,048
Now he needs to answer so many questions

1832
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
Absolutely can't answer

1833
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,168
What's the diff

1834
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,984
That's a pretty big fart

1835
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,336
Like listening to him I often find things he says that are lies things that are stupid

1836
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,408
But it's rare to find such an unforced error like that

1837
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,200
No one's asking him to like

1838
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,248
Make his message less extreme

1839
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
Or like the moderate

1840
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,320
No one

1841
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,952
For whatever reason he's just decided to moderate this anti-police a lot

1842
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,720
Downstairs

1843
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,768
You just made his job way harder

1844
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:48,352
He's accidentally supported martial law

1845
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,936
It's almost like

1846
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,240
By accident to be

1847
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,776
Reasonable about this

1848
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
Lesbian light

1849
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,896
Sing like

1850
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,480
For no reason he goes off brand

1851
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:10,880
Write the whole point is because unreasonable and is stonewalling in his absolutist is possible

1852
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,648
You if you

1853
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
Text one moment of

1854
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
Reasonability

1855
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:21,376
It's magical does a couple times

1856
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:25,728
Understand

1857
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,520
I don't think he understands what

1858
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,800
He believes or what

1859
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
You should be saying

1860
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,872
If he believed the things he believed

1861
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:35,200
I think it's just a glaring indication that

1862
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,528
He's making it up as he goes along at all based on feelings

1863
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,808
And whatever

1864
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
Banks in the mall

1865
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,672
Like

1866
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,488
Actually getting down

1867
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,024
Who he cares about

1868
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,048
Living or dying

1869
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
At that point

1870
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,864
Like sooner or later he's going

1871
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
You know everybody has a heart

1872
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,032
There you go you

1873
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,824
You are arbitrarily created

1874
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:07,200
I think that the arbitrary aspect is very

1875
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:13,856
Okay it looks like six blocks isn't

1876
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,648
I would love I would be fine with

1877
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,976
You're welcome to make that argument

1878
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:19,744
See him making

1879
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
That argument

1880
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,096
If one is okay and the other isn't

1881
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
Because otherwise

1882
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,400
It is arbitrary

1883
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:30,240
The basic idea behind that argument is

1884
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,384
More comfortable understanding that these people have

1885
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:40,480
Target that it's not just a wide sweep and that they are

1886
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:43,296
Narrowing it down in a very specific way

1887
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,600
And by having it only be a block

1888
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
I feel far safer

1889
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:50,976
Exactly

1890
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
You got it

1891
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:55,328
Crowdsourcing

1892
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,144
Erin Burnett

1893
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,168
From the night before

1894
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:10,432
I've heard them say it's probably

1895
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,656
Whoops

1896
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,960
Why would you do this

1897
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:34,752
I don't know

1898
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,920
Transcript

1899
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,456
And what he experienced

1900
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,760
What's

1901
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:50,624
Absolutely that is really good inside information

1902
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,648
That's really bad

1903
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,440
Even weirder is that he

1904
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,960
Specific

1905
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:11,360
Goody said Erin Burnett the night before interview too easy to trace down that it doesn't say where you're at

1906
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:17,760
Leg with a lot of his specific references

1907
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,808
He can be like that's not what I was talking about

1908
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:24,160
I think that might be

1909
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Goodbye

1910
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,792
You get the call from a guy

1911
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,584
About this

1912
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,144
Alex

1913
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,448
You'll see how it goes

1914
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:41,056
Wisconsin

1915
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:50,784
I expected to get cut off or is my house drone strike before I even get on there

1916
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:54,368
Okay you don't want your kids to die right

1917
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:58,720
I got kids to I don't want him to die

1918
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:02,816
On Facebook you want to know about the guy with the hat or the hair

1919
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,608
Guy with the hair

1920
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,632
Blue shirt

1921
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,424
Backpack

1922
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,264
Two hands

1923
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:12,800
Okay

1924
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,920
Facebook Sean

1925
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:21,760
Small to go hide behind the Red Cross

1926
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:24,832
That's why

1927
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,112
Give me your money

1928
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:34,560
What specifically what you're talkin about

1929
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:40,960
Alex knows well enough

1930
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,984
Knights of Malta

1931
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
Hiding behind a Red Cross

1932
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,568
George Bush

1933
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
That was

1934
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,480
Spectrum

1935
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,528
About right

1936
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,064
Protect

1937
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,136
You know like he needs to make sure that that

1938
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,416
Appearances

1939
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:03,488
Lest other listeners think like

1940
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,560
People who have

1941
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,120
Processing problem

1942
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,824
But the thing is

1943
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,128
You and your staff

1944
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,176
Put a cog in the wheel

1945
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,552
And you presented them online

1946
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,856
It made them delay

1947
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,392
The news brief

1948
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:33,440
It delayed the conferences

1949
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:38,048
And they had to change your story because of you and your new staff

1950
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,872
There's no

1951
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:53,920
Alex has sex

1952
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:57,248
This is all just Alex's imagination being reflected

1953
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:02,368
You're only saying that he's stopped

1954
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:06,464
Or the puzzle Alex

1955
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:14,656
It is enough

1956
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Is fun

1957
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,056
Alright I believe

1958
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,408
Man also wants to compliment

1959
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,528
Other caller said that he has a stack of Steel

1960
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,856
I think it's a meme that's going around

1961
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:37,440
And I got to tell you

1962
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:47,424
Without a doubt

1963
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,704
Before and after

1964
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,560
PR all of it is about the publicity

1965
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:16,096
Baby from the stunts

1966
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,144
You sent out their causes

1967
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,960
Y'all infowars.com

1968
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:23,008
Same thing he ends up doing in the 20s

1969
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,568
16 election

1970
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:27,104
Is this his arm out

1971
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:27,872
What is what he does

1972
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:32,992
When does serious issues going on but other people are trying to deal with

1973
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,528
He's trying to get a 10

1974
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,064
So

1975
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,344
Cool good job

1976
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,672
Another caller and here's where it goes from Vista

1977
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,696
Suggestion

1978
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:44,000
Cleaning up at

1979
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,328
Seriously suggest

1980
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:53,984
Martial law

1981
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:12,672
100

1982
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:17,536
Now

1983
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:23,168
Obviously

1984
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,960
So now that is the line

1985
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:29,056
The whole situation in Boston that's going on is just

1986
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,080
Streets whenever

1987
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,896
And there's a big problem with

1988
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,176
The first dated

1989
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:48,000
If you go and look at pictures of Boston

1990
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,024
From the 19th

1991
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,048
It's

1992
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,816
Weird

1993
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:51,584
Because

1994
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,120
Streets are fairly empty

1995
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,680
But if you go and look at those pictures

1996
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:57,728
Almost everyone has a few

1997
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,032
You'll be able to see a few people

1998
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,056
Because the shelter

1999
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:01,824
Place request

2000
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
Weather request

2001
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,408
It wasn't it wasn't like you have to

2002
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
Estate of your home

2003
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,968
If you wanted to go out and

2004
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:08,736
In about

2005
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,016
And enjoy

2006
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:12,320
I don't know Longfellow Park

2007
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,600
And I just like

2008
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,368
Take a risk

2009
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:19,488
It was multiple Dunkin Donuts

2010
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,024
Places we're still open

2011
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:25,632
The Dunkin Donuts to the goddamn

2012
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,472
The Google Street View car

2013
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:35,616
That was that was a real weird that's for that track a lot of miles

2014
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,640
No cars on the road

2015
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,968
But there were people out and about it's not like it's it's

2016
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,992
It's not like it was

2017
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,272
Strictly enforced

2018
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,064
Stay in your homes or we'll shoot you

2019
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,832
That's nonsense

2020
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,976
What we talked about earlier

2021
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,512
The warning that there's an act

2022
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Active shooting going

2023
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:59,936
Those controlled explosion thing that I was talking about has to do with the police find what they believed to be another device

2024
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:01,728
In a home that they were searching

2025
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,520
Where the Tsarnaev Brothers had

2026
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
State

2027
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:08,896
Also the media wasn't threatened or anything like that

2028
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,920
You can find her the police

2029
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,480
Like there's a place called Hutton

2030
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,248
Photography

2031
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:16,832
If you just Google the Boston Marathon week

2032
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,368
They have tons of pictures

2033
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,392
Of the police

2034
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,720
So there is no there's no

2035
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,488
This is a 0

2036
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:24,768
Anyway

2037
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:27,072
I mostly just played that clipped illustrate

2038
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,912
Did they're just trying to clean up happy

2039
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
Narrative

2040
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,752
Broken record

2041
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,616
Everything in this coverage

2042
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,152
Is stuff Alex's imagine

2043
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,944
It's none of it is real

2044
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,272
Really that that caller

2045
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:47,552
And Alex both

2046
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,576
This is a

2047
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,136
Cleanser

2048
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,672
Or whatever

2049
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,696
Saying it's just

2050
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
I can't

2051
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,768
Really comprehend

2052
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,328
Like that

2053
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,352
That is just

2054
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
It's not

2055
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
Real man

2056
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,752
We cracked

2057
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:08,800
Code energy

2058
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:09,824
Like I don't

2059
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,664
I can actually explain a little bit of that

2060
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,200
But I don't fully

2061
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,784
The feeling that people are having

2062
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,552
Alex's

2063
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
Instilling

2064
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
I think there's a funk

2065
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:25,696
But before we do Alex

2066
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:44,128
You should be talking about MIT police officer with the night before

2067
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,688
Any of this stuff could be discussed

2068
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:53,088
Instead

2069
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,672
It's like there's another there cleaning up

2070
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,720
Troll in there

2071
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:03,072
Acevedo police of Austin

2072
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:24,064
Gun confiscation

2073
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:33,024
I choose you on Twitter to show me guns

2074
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:57,856
This is absolutely ridiculous and

2075
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,904
Jocular

2076
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,464
It really makes it seem like all of the things he

2077
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,744
He's talking about her jokes

2078
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,584
My gun

2079
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,120
Nrsv

2080
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,144
Look

2081
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
You talkin about

2082
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,960
It just ate

2083
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,496
It's so deflated

2084
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,520
To Alex's

2085
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,312
I've just

2086
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:27,040
Goddamn you very well

2087
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
Set the answer Alex

2088
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,368
Was really going to give you from the beginning

2089
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,648
It doesn't matter

2090
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,720
Doesn't matter if you say yes

2091
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Or no

2092
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,328
I'm going to say you did whatever I want to do whatever I need to do

2093
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:42,656
Soy

2094
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,936
Because

2095
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:47,264
Started trying to get him to fight

2096
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,104
Brodnicki

2097
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
Pretend coming together

2098
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:02,112
Like he did with the sneaky snake with Joe Rogan does this all the time

2099
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:03,392
So he did that with her

2100
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,856
I understand

2101
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,904
That's far funnier than

2102
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:42,304
I understand confrontational strategy

2103
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,376
You coming by

2104
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,192
If you understand that

2105
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:51,520
His family did flee Cuba to the United States

2106
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,824
Like telling him to go back

2107
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,104
The Cuba

2108
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:02,272
Or even just like

2109
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:06,368
It is a country

2110
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,928
To say that part of the motivation behind that is

2111
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:09,952
Believing

2112
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:12,000
You don't belong

2113
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,376
I don't think it's a hundred percent that but there's two

2114
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,656
Pictures of it that make me on

2115
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,984
The way that he's bullying people is

2116
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,896
Involving the police response

2117
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:50,400
We think it's 41 guy we don't have all the information

2118
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,192
I'm sure they have good reason

2119
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:10,368
We don't know really what the situation

2120
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,232
We can't be together

2121
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,072
This interview is completely fine

2122
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:22,912
It's mostly Alex trying to bring up his gun talking points

2123
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,680
Bernard being like

2124
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:28,288
I think the background checks are very reasonable thing for citizens to submit to

2125
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,848
It's not a huge deal there will not be any comps

2126
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:31,616
Application

2127
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,408
I would never go along with that

2128
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:36,224
I've not heard anybody suggest that seriously

2129
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,248
And anyway

2130
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,272
It's just pointless

2131
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:44,416
Absolutely

2132
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:48,768
With you caliber Barrett

2133
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,816
No you can't just pull out a gun

2134
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,120
Find

2135
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,680
Define

2136
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,960
It's not loaded

2137
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,152
Alex

2138
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:07,456
Get in trouble for going shooting

2139
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:18,208
I know you're good

2140
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:24,864
I'm not worried about

2141
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,144
It's just nonsense

2142
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
Goddamn

2143
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:34,848
Really nice guy

2144
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,200
Since you weird

2145
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,480
Needling

2146
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:42,016
Make him angry

2147
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,880
Exhausted by your

2148
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:51,488
Do you understand

2149
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,304
But he's clearly at least aware of like

2150
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,120
He's full of s***

2151
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:00,960
Pictures of Becky

2152
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:02,496
The f****** car

2153
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,264
Putting it

2154
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,640
Subway

2155
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,176
But not

2156
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:15,552
It's not worth

2157
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
What happened

2158
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,088
Which is weird

2159
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,392
Alex is back

2160
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:22,976
Is gone and Alex's

2161
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,256
Killing the Patxi's

2162
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,024
Narrative

2163
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,680
Is the most probable

2164
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:33,216
Scenario

2165
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:37,056
Illogical Behavior I've seen from

2166
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:39,104
Spot-on

2167
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:43,200
Toyota Colorado Springs

2168
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:45,504
Imaginary razor that is exactly what month

2169
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,552
Narrative

2170
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:52,672
Completely shifting over the course of this day you're on the 19th

2171
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,952
Are the Navy Seals

2172
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,232
Military men

2173
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,560
The entire lockdown is

2174
02:06:58,816 --> 02:06:59,840
To sweep Appaloosa and

2175
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,864
Then kill these

2176
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,984
It's just developed over the course of the show as opposed

2177
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,800
To talk about anything real

2178
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,568
Because

2179
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,128
Alex knows the stakes are too high

2180
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,408
It's a f******

2181
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:14,944
Shout

2182
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,736
So we're now into the fourth hour

2183
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,504
Of the show

2184
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
What's interesting about this

2185
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,368
Overdrive

2186
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,160
And I'm still taking calls

2187
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:32,352
Listening to the police scanner and watching the

2188
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,656
How's things going

2189
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:39,776
Police officer shot

2190
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:43,104
As far as I know this is the first mention of that

2191
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:46,944
In the fourth hour of the show caller brings up the cops

2192
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:49,248
Alex reference

2193
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,784
And I missed it

2194
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,576
Maybe that's possible

2195
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:55,904
But from my listening to this that was the first time I heard

2196
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:56,672
Which is

2197
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:57,440
Crazy

2198
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,512
Yeah

2199
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,216
Cuz why not

2200
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:13,056
So yes but dandi call and it's all just stupid about how

2201
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:27,136
I've done stuff like he's doing now.

2202
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,328
President

2203
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,800
And most

2204
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:46,848
100

2205
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,408
Visitors

2206
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,712
A minute for hours

2207
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,272
Infowars.com

2208
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,832
100,000 visitors

2209
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,648
All roads lead back

2210
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
To publicity

2211
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:02,976
All roads lead back to his bottom

2212
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,536
What's the saying is not

2213
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:07,840
Something

2214
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:10,144
That is actually

2215
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,192
Actively important

2216
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:17,056
What is John is pull off a bigger than any I've been able to do in my career

2217
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:28,064
2 million downloads thanks everybody we couldn't have done this without your help

2218
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:31,904
But instead of that second part they said download

2219
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:37,024
Because we lied about 9/11

2220
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,048
Fryst

2221
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,144
So instead of dealing with the real issues going on in the city of Austin

2222
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
Surrounding

2223
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
This bombing

2224
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,960
Alex

2225
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:49,056
Decides to spend a good amount of this fourth hour

2226
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:52,640
Complaining about Bill O'Reilly talking about

2227
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,712
Bill O'Reilly talks about Alex

2228
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:58,784
Play this video from

2229
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,552
The Family Guy

2230
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:04,416
Wright Bella was like

2231
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,208
No build is not like

2232
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:10,560
Against what Alex is doing

2233
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,608
I don't believe that

2234
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:13,888
Baby

2235
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,704
Furious

2236
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,008
This is important

2237
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:22,592
Call Shawn Christian

2238
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:42,816
Boston Marathon

2239
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:00,992
It never happened

2240
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,232
Blurb

2241
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:14,304
16

2242
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:15,328
17

2243
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,608
18

2244
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,888
Very

2245
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:22,752
Big piece of Alex's obsession

2246
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,568
Many many times

2247
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,152
Pretty sure

2248
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,712
He plays the clip of Bill O'Reilly

2249
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,272
Bill is right

2250
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:38,528
Boston Marathon

2251
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,648
How do you do it

2252
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:03,872
The people didn't see that clip on

2253
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,920
Because it's additive

2254
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,200
Cuz it's doctor

2255
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,736
Is not

2256
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,528
Engaging with critics

2257
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,320
The part of this

2258
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,600
People take issue with

2259
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,904
Is taking the part of the body

2260
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,464
To the part about the marathon

2261
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:21,536
Is a distortion of what this episode

2262
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,608
When Alex says he blows up the marathon blows up

2263
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,632
Not true

2264
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,424
The blowing up with other stuff

2265
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:35,616
He's on the right side of this one

2266
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,224
Nitpicking

2267
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
Being like

2268
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
How do they do this

2269
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:48,416
How to edit videos

2270
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:52,512
Confused

2271
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:56,352
We know that he loves to do it live

2272
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,424
I don't

2273
02:13:59,936 --> 02:14:02,240
Don't understand why

2274
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,776
Video and splice it together

2275
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:09,152
Alex is really serious about this

2276
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,176
Bill O'Reilly

2277
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,248
But before he does

2278
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:15,040
He gets to this

2279
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
Is Central

2280
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,368
Do a lot of his ID

2281
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:20,672
He's trying to explain

2282
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,256
Conspiracy going on

2283
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:34,496
Could literally come from any month

2284
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:36,032
Of any gear vouchers show

2285
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:38,080
It's a constant refrain that uses

2286
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:38,848
Convinces audio

2287
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,896
Except outlandish conclusions

2288
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:42,944
This bombing was a big set up by the government

2289
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:48,320
What are the reasons that line he's selling it

2290
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,648
Except for people is because of

2291
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:57,536
Most of Alex's conspiracies are presented as being really simple

2292
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,328
What is staggering amount of protest

2293
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:02,400
The question does seem to ask itself

2294
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:04,448
Why would these people all agree to something

2295
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:08,800
Whatever else needs to justify something he's running out of options

2296
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,824
Is default

2297
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,896
To say that the globalists know that they've committed crimes

2298
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:16,480
And whatever conspiracy he's selling that days they're only

2299
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,504
Themselves out of prison

2300
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:19,552
We seen it over and over and over

2301
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,856
In the present-day this is explanation

2302
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,672
The Deep state

2303
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:26,720
They're all going to prison

2304
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:28,512
Explains how wide

2305
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:30,048
Conspiracy would have to be

2306
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,608
This narrative crotch also serves a second

2307
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,424
Which is to make every single

2308
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:37,472
Conspiracy that Alex

2309
02:15:37,984 --> 02:15:39,264
A matter of immediate life

2310
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:41,312
If a global its needs

2311
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,080
Pull this off

2312
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:45,152
In order to make sure they don't go to prison for

2313
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,272
Just bring the truth out on this one

2314
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,296
They might just

2315
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,832
Globalist want

2316
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
Brawl

2317
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,880
Every half-cooked

2318
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:57,696
Every fantasy about a picture he finds on Fortune

2319
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:01,536
They're all elevated to nearly absurd important when their frame

2320
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,888
And what's so crazy is that it's so consistent in his career

2321
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:09,728
But I really thought some of this stuff that you could we hear this a lot

2322
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,312
Increasing desperation

2323
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:14,336
Canada Post 26

2324
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,896
Here it is and Rozier times

2325
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,664
The 2013

2326
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,944
You just constantly f******

2327
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:22,272
Like this is our shot

2328
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,552
Every single time

2329
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,320
And they fall for it

2330
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:25,856
Does

2331
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:26,880
Cheerleader

2332
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,208
His imaginary world

2333
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:32,256
Like

2334
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,792
Unaffected

2335
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,072
Buy reality

2336
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,864
But it absorbed

2337
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:43,776
You know like what's going on in the real world

2338
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,104
His imaginary version

2339
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:53,760
Informant bubble reality

2340
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,296
Space

2341
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,320
Information

2342
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,368
From reality

2343
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:01,184
The main thrust of the imaginary

2344
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,976
Universe will always stay can

2345
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:09,376
Call Alex wouldn't say cleanup Patxi's if there wasn't shelter-in-place request

2346
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:15,520
Right

2347
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:17,312
The bad guys would always be

2348
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,848
Be willing to go clean

2349
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:19,616
People up

2350
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:23,968
No matter what

2351
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:28,832
And that's what I was referencing earlier when you said

2352
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:31,648
Why are these people feel so intensely

2353
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,416
In

2354
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:38,048
Yeah I'm part of the reason is because Alex is selling it in such a way that they're like to believe

2355
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,584
We can just pull this off

2356
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:42,912
If we can pull this all night finally be rid of those global

2357
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:44,960
Little B it's game over

2358
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:47,264
Like I said

2359
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:49,824
Play to fight

2360
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,920
O'Reilly

2361
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:07,488
Jesus

2362
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:16,960
I don't like turtles

2363
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:20,800
Like being the Survivor of child

2364
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,920
Especially on the same

2365
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,944
Episode where some

2366
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:31,040
Offer to fight was on earlier

2367
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:42,560
Patterns

2368
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,352
We need to talk

2369
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:47,424
Engine from somebody who he believes will be able to help

2370
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:56,896
As we get towards the end of this episode

2371
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:59,200
To David

2372
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,504
To do a couple more hours

2373
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,528
Sure you keep that

2374
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,576
But

2375
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:06,112
He starts to realize it

2376
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:07,648
Dangerous Game

2377
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,440
His life is in danger

2378
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:12,768
He wants everyone to know

2379
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,048
Let's

2380
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:15,584
If he died

2381
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:16,864
Keep the fire

2382
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:00,896
Yikes

2383
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,944
That's a weird and

2384
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:05,760
Is that the end of the show it's supposed to be

2385
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:13,952
After that break

2386
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:18,048
What are those

2387
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:32,640
Nashville Mental Health

2388
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
E-bikes

2389
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,928
Interesting

2390
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:45,952
Comet

2391
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:58,496
Cartwheels

2392
02:20:58,752 --> 02:21:00,800
And probably go on vacation 408

2393
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:04,384
Around

2394
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:09,760
Because I really want to believe

2395
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:13,856
Start cartwheels Alex

2396
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:17,952
He's going to apologize

2397
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:22,304
Alright

2398
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,352
You know his

2399
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,120
Argument

2400
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:27,680
Just prove it

2401
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:29,984
He is saying if it proved it's not

2402
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:34,848
So I guess you would never accept whatever evidence

2403
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:37,152
Because whatever evidence you have is only ever

2404
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:38,688
That it is more up

2405
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:40,224
Just move the goalposts

2406
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,808
You sort of responding

2407
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:44,832
To a little bit of

2408
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,880
Insecurities that he didn't

2409
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,160
Cover the shooting from

2410
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,184
The night before

2411
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,000
Articulate

2412
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:01,984
Address

2413
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:03,264
Alex

2414
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,832
I need money

2415
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,624
Why didn't

2416
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,904
She talked about it earlier

2417
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:22,720
That's a good question

2418
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:26,304
Question it's like yes absolutely

2419
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:31,168
There's no reason why you needed to cover that at 3 in the morning or earlier than

2420
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,472
It doesn't explain why it's

2421
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:35,008
Almost not addressed

2422
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:35,776
At all

2423
02:22:36,032 --> 02:22:37,568
On this episode

2424
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:40,640
Is that I can only talk about what is happening in this area

2425
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:47,040
It is impossible for me to talk about the past or the future very serious disease

2426
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:50,368
I don't know what the

2427
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:51,648
The f*** is going on

2428
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:55,232
I know that I suggested at the beginning of this episode

2429
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:58,048
It feels like he knows that it's too hot

2430
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:00,864
He's being

2431
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,144
Daytona get a lot of P

2432
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:04,960
I think there is a Feeling.

2433
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,520
I don't know

2434
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:10,336
Maybe he just didn't want to cover it

2435
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,384
I mean it really does

2436
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,456
Seem like he could also

2437
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:17,760
Attention span

2438
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:20,064
I don't know I don't know

2439
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,344
He's just like I I don't feel

2440
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:22,368
It's no worries

2441
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,160
It's no fun doing

2442
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,464
The Second Amendment

2443
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,744
Now they're killing

2444
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,280
Hundreds of Patsy's

2445
02:23:29,536 --> 02:23:31,328
Maybe hundred we don't know exact number

2446
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:36,448
Play story

2447
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,728
Two loads

2448
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:38,752
This b*******

2449
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,080
Very

2450
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,664
There is a there is a shift

2451
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,248
The only real difference

2452
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,016
Between

2453
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,808
What happened on the 8th

2454
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:53,600
What happened on the 19th

2455
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:56,416
Up until the end of Alex's show on the 8th

2456
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:59,744
The FBI hadn't released the suspect's photos

2457
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:02,304
Abstract

2458
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:04,608
Concrete information

2459
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,888
And on the 19th

2460
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:07,936
An official story

2461
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:12,544
Unfolding situation

2462
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:15,104
Actions being taken

2463
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:19,456
That's the only difference that I see in between the two and Alex's behavior is

2464
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,224
Completely

2465
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:23,296
Now granted he's still lying and making up a narrative

2466
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,832
Born looking

2467
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:27,648
Your disease already established

2468
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:33,024
The cleaning up

2469
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,048
People

2470
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:36,096
It's just different

2471
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:38,400
I don't know I don't know exactly how to put my finger on it

2472
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:41,984
Like

2473
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:45,312
It's like you

2474
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:46,080
Play

2475
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,384
With a specific actor in mind

2476
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:51,456
The run for a good year and then

2477
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,248
Keeps going but the

2478
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:57,856
Can be the same play you're putting different characters

2479
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:00,160
Do a play written for

2480
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,512
They're coming for our guns

2481
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,280
Play

2482
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,560
And your throne in Navy

2483
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:07,584
Seals and it's just not the

2484
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:11,424
Second time

2485
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:23,712
Express what

2486
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:26,272
Cop out

2487
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:29,856
Images of see how this develops

2488
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:33,184
Slightly

2489
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:39,072
This feels much more like normal hours

2490
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:40,864
I think the fever has broken

2491
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:43,936
As for the city of Boston

2492
02:25:44,448 --> 02:25:45,472
Tonight

2493
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:46,752
In the evening

2494
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:50,848
Finding Zohar

2495
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:57,760
I mean I know that Alex will probably just return

2496
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,552
Kind of more normal

2497
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:01,856
Conspiracy bulshit

2498
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:07,232
Real f*****-up

2499
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:10,048
This stretches

2500
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:12,096
Weather 5 days

2501
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,424
The 19th

2502
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,216
It's been awhile

2503
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:17,984
Michelle

2504
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,776
You've been so irresponsible

2505
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:20,800
He's done

2506
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,080
About is bad

2507
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:23,104
The job is good

2508
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,152
You should have a parade

2509
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:27,456
To be so thrilled

2510
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:29,248
You've broken the case wide open

2511
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:30,528
No one is ever

2512
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:32,064
Failed as hard

2513
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,856
Well dessert

2514
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,624
King they deserve

2515
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:35,648
It's

2516
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,672
Literally

2517
02:26:42,048 --> 02:26:45,120
Boomers Vista

2518
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,424
It is

2519
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:51,776
That I feel right now that you can feel that you can do that stuff

2520
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,544
Kizi

2521
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:54,080
You would think any

2522
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,152
No

2523
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:59,456
For him to guess like this level is

2524
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:08,672
What is

2525
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:09,952
You expect that from me

2526
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:12,768
Please

2527
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,656
Remind me of that I'm always

2528
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:20,704
Behavior is way less becoming

2529
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:22,752
From someone in his

2530
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:29,152
But don't talk about

2531
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:31,712
It's it's like

2532
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:38,112
Like you can really see the intention of crafting narrative it serves his purposes

2533
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:44,256
The behavior and then the goal achieved

2534
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:46,560
Almost

2535
02:27:49,376 --> 02:27:50,400
Exactly

2536
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:56,288
Spinning

2537
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:57,312
A yarn

2538
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:00,640
He's post-coitus

2539
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:14,208
We have a website

2540
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:21,376
