1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex

3
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
Have you ever done backyard

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
No I haven't no but

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
Your talk about like organized

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
But he might back in like fourth and fifth grade bags

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,424
She is never organized credibility

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
Friend of the show and in goodbye

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
He actually did do backyard wrestling when he was younger man

10
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
He has a credibility I don't have Powerball

11
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
Georgia

12
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
Nothing about probably not the owner name

13
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Got it

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I want to record a little bit of your TuneIn

15
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Knowledge fight and you're different episode thrilled to do a crossover

16
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,272
Bit of an episode with the guys from qanon anonymous

17
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
And we are pumped

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
2% that for you

19
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,304
I thought it would be nice to jump in here at the beginning give everybody an update on my plants

20
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,128
Doing well

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
It's hard to grow herbs Tumblr

22
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Everybody from our last episode on Friday

23
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,072
Nothing we've talked about has ever been this galvanizing of the audience

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,912
Multiple multiple people is offered to send me copies of it

25
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,240
And I appreciate everybody's that generosity and interest

26
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
It's so it's really cool

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,408
Obscure

28
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
Card based

29
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Intricate game

30
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
And people respond so aggressive

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
Very cool

32
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
That resonate with people and they respond

33
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm glad that there are people

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
I like it.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Peace talks

36
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
I'm a policy wonk

37
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
Welcome listeners to the 40th chapter of the

38
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
The qanon Anonymous podcast

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,064
And a 1776 episode of knowledge fight

40
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
The Alex Jones

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
Allow me to introduce the delegation of

42
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Qanon represented by

43
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Travis view Jake rockatansky enjoy and field

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Hello

45
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,248
LOL

46
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
That's over here for the meeting

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
So across the table from us the delegation of Alex Jones represented by

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
Jordan Holmes

49
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,120
In honor of

50
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Very

51
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,312
I protest this very much not like gentlemen

52
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
There Will Be Blood as both sides State solution

53
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
With no border between Alex Jones and qanon

54
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
A harmonious world of peace

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Love

56
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
And shared cognitive dissonance

57
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
Main issues on the docket today are as follows

58
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Number one will be done

59
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Number two will be immigration

60
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
And number three will be the podesta

61
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,447
Definitely all categories that match

62
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Each other after

63
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,079
Expository arguments by both delegations we will enter what UNESCO cause

64
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Discussion time

65
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663
During which we basically power outage shoot the s***

66
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
Catch up on recipes and subtly undermine Jake

67
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
I just want to say

68
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
That this is our most requested

69
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Crossover episode

70
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
And so just want to thank you fellas

71
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Buffer for joining us on it

72
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,655
I'd like to point out that

73
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:01,823
We join them

74
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
In wanting to subtly undermine Jake which is what's important

75
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,831
I figured that we would be using the Conch system of talking to each other but

76
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
That's fine

77
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,231
Yes yes well until inevitably one of us feels like the others had the Conch for too long and then

78
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
We start murdering each other and I eating our Flash

79
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
Ward

80
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Behalf of the Alex Jones table

81
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Before I get into my remarks

82
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,743
I'd like to point out that ground established we can build upon to her

83
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Malt

84
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,351
Both are ranked

85
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
Alex Jones has had him on as a guest for many years but now it is later career incredibly long to videos

86
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
Rambling about Q Clues

87
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
I'm referring of course

88
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
As the child of the rationalization to unite the parties of this broken home

89
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Conspiracy

90
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Let it be known that today but

91
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:34,495
Horrible destruction in their lives

92
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,871
But if you dig for the truth you'll find people who are afraid of how aggressively Alex Telles

93
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
The truth

94
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
Particularly about God's greatest creation

95
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
The gun

96
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
Some people will tell you that the Chinese invented

97
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
It was God

98
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,463
Is the single most important exist

99
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
And now it's his right to own as many as he wants and whatever he wants with no

100
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Is literally the only thing that is standing between pure beautiful freedom and dystopian globalist

101
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
Which I should point out

102
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
So is this why Alex actually looks like a Gun Locker

103
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,671
The dog

104
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Is Guns n and Gun Locker

105
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
You see this country only exist because of guns

106
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
That's right

107
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
America was invented because the British tried to take

108
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
The colonists guns away we're going to start a revolution

109
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,383
Now sure the British tried to confiscate guns April 17th 75

110
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
A good four years after North Carolina Regulators letter armed Rebellion over unfair tax

111
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
Years after the Boston Tea Party protesting

112
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,463
And months after the British had declared Massachusetts

113
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,815
The Suffolk resolves largely directed

114
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:09,215
Itself a retaliation for the Boston Tea Party

115
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
Forget all that stuff it doesn't matter

116
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,895
The truth is that right before Lexington and Concord the British tried to take the weapons of colonists

117
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
Already pretty much a rebellion over taxes

118
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,063
And that proves conclusively that this country would not exist without gun

119
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
And if I expect

120
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
You guessed it

121
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Gone

122
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Reason you get up in the morning

123
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Guns

124
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
A hundred percent because of guns usually that

125
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:50,431
By 8 that is going to fire

126
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
I feel like a Rube Goldberg machine with a name of an M16 at the endpoint that your head

127
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
YouTube video

128
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
Where they have all the dominoes taking forever to go off and then it's

129
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,863
Just hit the got a dildo but I could see that being apart of like a cutscene from an Ernest Motors

130
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Absolutely

131
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
I didn't say anything about vaping

132
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
The globalist Menace that we face today

133
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Coach we conquered back in 1776

134
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
And they have never stopped wanting to take Americans guns away

135
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
Revolution

136
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
The Rothschild George Soros

137
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
And noted anglophiles like h.g. Wells

138
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
They've been plotting for centuries to take down the Great American experiment

139
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,663
They play all sorts of dirty tricks that may appear to be hurting the economy or creating greater public

140
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
But make no mistake

141
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Behind every single one of their plan

142
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
Is the obsessive desire to take away Alex's gun

143
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
Specifically Alex's gun

144
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
All roads lead back to attempt a gun grab

145
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Literally everything

146
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
Take fluoride

147
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
You know why they put fluoride in the water

148
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Scientist will tell you it's for your teeth

149
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,007
And the peer-reviewed studies the show

150
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
But you should know better than to listen to mainstream scientists

151
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
These are globalist scientists who don't want you to know that there's fluoride in the water to make you dumb and wheat

152
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
Resist when they come and try and take your guns

153
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,159
Strong in the teeth weak on the draw quote Thomas Jefferson

154
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,975
The real Thomas Jefferson quote by the way

155
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
Hundred percent very real

156
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Make teeth Victorian again

157
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
Literally everything is secretly about gun control policy made by the Federal Reserve is an effort to devalue

158
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,895
Galaxy gun

159
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Every mass shooting is a carefully orchestrated globalist false flag

160
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Publix Heartstrings

161
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Taking Alex's gun

162
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
Feminism is real version of female empowerment empowerment

163
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Comes from gun

164
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
And that's half the population will be armed to help Alex

165
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
Not have his guns taken away

166
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Money and politics aside unspoken issue behind every conversation about policy

167
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,711
Economy going to take a long sober look at the fact

168
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,343
It becomes playing that every bill every house concurrent resolution every executive order

169
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,951
Has an unspoken Clause regarding whether or not Alex Jones can keep his gun

170
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
Historians in the 2100 will undoubtedly look back at this issue as the defining political question of this Jenner

171
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
Duration and as long as we can find some common ground.

172
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
There may be hope

173
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
Of us reaching a true and Lasting conspiracy

174
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
Thank you our delegation thanks you for your words

175
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
A great comfort

176
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
I can already see that we are going to be friends

177
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
And that we're going to find a lot of Middle Ground

178
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,623
22

179
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
That's comforting

180
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
First of all I'd like to state that we are above these two

181
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
You never stoop to directly mentioning the second amend

182
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
In fact across all Q drops

183
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
The only amendment directly mentioned is

184
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Is the 25th

185
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Now let's be clear

186
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
25th amendment is ADT or playable character

187
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
Nobody in their right mind would use competitively its

188
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
It's just not that powerful in the current meta game

189
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
In fact it was created in the wake of

190
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
JFK's murder to make sure they would be clear next steps

191
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
In case of president

192
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
Resigns dies or is incapacitated a removed from office

193
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
For some reason

194
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,815
And really just mostly insurers at the vice president would take over when

195
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
Exact

196
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
Play the reason Q Frets more about this amendment than me recently buffed Str juggernauts the first and second and

197
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Amendment is it he fears the president

198
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,919
Will be pushed into a McDonald's ball pit by the CIA and disappear forever

199
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,015
So I'm sorry I know I'm not representing my delegation with dignity here

200
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
My wife

201
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Left me this morning and

202
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
I mistook my dish soap for coffee

203
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
What are you talking about

204
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,351
But your wife leaving you

205
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
Huron actually seems divided on

206
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
On one side they believe guns are good

207
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Here's a q drop from February 23rd 2000

208
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
18 y school shooting

209
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
What is more precious than our children

210
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Emotional

211
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Event

212
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Congrats event

213
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
What would locals go along with such a sick

214
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Organized

215
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,047
Must control local police

216
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
Kelly officials Etc to work

217
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Why

218
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
Many dollar sign

219
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
Federal aid plus donation

220
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
These people are sick

221
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,719
Now here Q links to a 2014 article for current by Dave altimari entitled

222
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,791
Sandy Hook two years later where is the aid going

223
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
In it he details all the different initiatives setup

224
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
To help the community in the aftermath

225
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
The shooting

226
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
The author reports positively on these

227
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
But also shines a light on the bureaucracy and inefficiency

228
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
Some families unsupported or unclear on where they can

229
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Find help

230
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Askew continues

231
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Follow the money

232
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
It's always about the money

233
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Jew

234
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,927
Why is he doing old article examining an event for the late

235
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
2012

236
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Well it turns out that the Parkland

237
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
School shooting had occurred less than

238
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
10 days before

239
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
If you needed to make it clear that Parkland was a false flag

240
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
And even if it weren't a false flag

241
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
And it would still be a way for the Deep state to grab your guns

242
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,615
And even if it wasn't that that it at least shows how local officials are controlled by the deep sea

243
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,479
But hate that might also not be true in which case let's examine how the money raised after the

244
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
This kind of tragedy is going

245
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Pocket

246
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
This q-drop is the definition of a Gish gallop

247
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
Overwhelming your opponent with more arguments than they can feasibly address

248
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
In a response

249
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Q thinks his audiences Rock dumb

250
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
He made another drop on the 10th of March

251
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Guns are safe

252
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Stop falling

253
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Fake news

254
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
Doubt still not at Q

255
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
What if he hadn't been clear enough

256
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
What if his followers were more stupid than he thought

257
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
Well on March 27th

258
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
He finally addressed his anxieties with this drop

259
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Parkland is a distraction

260
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
Parkland What specifically organized at his side to distract

261
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
What's the news

262
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
Actors are acting

263
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Justice will be served at those playing the game

264
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Guns are safe

265
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Trustpoint

266
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Q

267
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
Sadly this did little to save cues hunger for Revenge

268
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Still he slept like s***

269
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,223
Still his dumbass followers believe the Earth was flat JFK jr. was alive

270
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
Still they regularly mistook mayonnaise for yogurt

271
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
So in early April

272
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
She decided to take action

273
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
This time with a more productive

274
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
It's been on Gunn

275
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
He posited a new type of gun mighty

276
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
A bad guy

277
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,143
What I'm sorry guys but you'll see

278
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
You understand why very

279
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Very soon

280
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Here's a drop he made on the

281
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031

Black Ops

283
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,879
Call cloud in like night-vision.

284
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
So although

285
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,023
Referring to clowns America or the CIA

286
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Performance

287
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Raised owl

00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
Supporter to what

289
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
13 / 0

290
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
Sex traffic

291
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Drugs roadblock

292
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Gordon's roadblock

293
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
China / Russia

294
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
Intel pool roadblock

295
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
May we don't say blah

296
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,743
Easy Roblox

297

298
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,607
More than you know

299
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
Fight for the Wallace

300
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
So much for

301
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
Is he saying that Voldemort made is the Voldemort

302
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,455
Say his name

303
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:01,855
That's cute

304
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Yeah they also said authorities

305
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
His brain cancer was a fake

306
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
And that he didn't actually die executed instead of instead of die

307
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
He was here

308
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
Secretly as as

309
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
Yeah because yeah because all the

310
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
Coerced

311
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Wake up to

312
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
2 Q is by X

313
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,735
Executions that are completely hidden from the public

314
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,063
So you're not sure if they even took

315
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,183
C4 us the name that we don't say Arizona is Joe Arpaio

316
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
I took that a little differently

317
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:46,143
So the wall then as far as cute as concerned is an effective way to stop the bad gums from

318
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Coming into the country

319
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
I mean can you imagine if America were flooded with weapons

320
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Like when that stock

321
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,943
Anyways one of his fan to ask him whether the wall was about more than just you know stopping drugs assassins and child traffickers

322
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Perhaps if and positive

323
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
Mexico was going to be used as a quote

324
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
Vector in the event of War

325
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Soak you responded

326
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
What you would say to Country whereby a

327
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Good portion of its citizens are armed

328
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
Ultimate deterrent

329
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
2

330
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
This does not answer the question about Mexico nor does it have anything to do with the wall it's just a boilerplate reaffirming of the

331
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Second Amendment

332
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
At this point

333
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Furious

334
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Why won't

335
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
Pigs eat the slop provided and shut up with the questions

336
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
What if you could write a very long

337
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
Totally sane

338
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,087
Mostly all caps drop that answered all possible questions you could ever have

339
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Sleeves

340
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
P***

00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Gun control

00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Fake

344
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Election rigging

345
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
Drool

346
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
Your voice does not matter

347
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Water

348
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
Typical sports for home use cleaning

349
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Cancer

352
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519
Choice is yours

353
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,639
With a given your children cancer through cleaning products

He was like

359
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
I better mention the paces baby on floor

360
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
Under my boot

361
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383
Totally dominating it

362
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
The middle

363
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Flossing

364
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,623
If I if you still have any questions after that drop it is

365
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
The delegations belief that you should

366
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
She typed them up into a word doc

367
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
In place that doctor reckley in the digital trash Patriot because you're too f****** stupid even for

368
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
Inclusion at the delegation representing keeping on I-90 closed my expository argument by stating a

369
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
A simple fact

370
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
One that does not care about your

371
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Feelings

372
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
There are two types of guns

373
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
The ones owned by Americans

374
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
And that guns the ones owned by everyone else

375
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,088
We need to protect the border from the bad guns and continue to stockpile the good

376
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
We can find some good common ground in that position

377
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,376
I think if you're if you're if you at

378
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,192
So that would have been

379
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,496
Animated coffee a tasso

380
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:08,896
Urinal cake out of my baby's mouth

381
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:15,296
Guns that other people have could become good gun

382
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,600
Given to Americans

383
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:23,488
I think that we could probably move forward as long as we don't demonize the guns just because people don't like

384
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,840
Actually that's a really good plant to have it wrong

385
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
All just wanted to take

386
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
The bad guns away they're forgetting a key element

387
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
You take the bad guns

388
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
And then give them to people who will use them

389
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
For good you put them in the Calvin and Hobbes

390
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,968
Transmogrifier and then take him out

391
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
And you can use it on brown people now

392
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,416
Yeah well and yeah you know self-defense ghetto you can stand your ground with it

393
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
All of these

394
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
Things are good for guns need along kind of M16 shaped object

395
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
Stand your ground cuz it'll serve as a came

396
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,728
Right right

397
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,104
There is one insistence that

398
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Guns are safe

399
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
And it was acute drop and so sure of the followers

400
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Even though the

401
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Keepsake

402
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
To take the Gods

403
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
There's no real risk of that happen

404
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,952
If I understand

405
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,256
The aljo delegation position

406
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,352
They believe that there is a very real possibility that any moment

407
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,728
That the government's can't descend upon the Alex Jones specifically

408
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Sprite Corrections

409
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:50,528
If you open your door right now waiting for the signal to grab

410
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:56,928
Ruth is little

411
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Trying to f****** yet from what I understand is there constantly standing outside of everybody's

412
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
Apartment or are they just have cloaking technology

413
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
So you know the moment you know the moment the orders given

414
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:18,432
Pomodoro to take your goddamn crap I would like to say one thing that I believe can build a bridge between us it's the belief that I think

415
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,784
Both cute out share that there that guns don't kill people

416
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
Bad people do

417
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,928
And so I would say that we meet in the middle there

418
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
In that

419
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
If for example MS-13 had a gun

420
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
It wouldn't make the gun technically bad

421
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
Just

422
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Dad got until it's dropped by the MS

423
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
13%

424
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
Neutral is good

425
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,432
So have we negotiated enough

426
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
Do do we feel like we can live together

427
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
I think so and I was

428
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
Pieces of information

429
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Nobody

430
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
No I think he means like if

431
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,216
For example your teacher

432
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,800
Patagon that would make you as schoolchildren safer

433
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:23,200
Or even that gun just in general are safe and if you get killed by one

434
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
I mean that's your f****** fault buddy Bridge built

435
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:36,000
To get killed by about people on is that there's a general theme like everything's under control in like all of yours

436
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,096
Surah conspiratorial dreams will come true and so

437
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
This paradise of the paradise

438
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,264
Everybody gets bored with the birth certificate

439
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
But so so I

440
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
A sort of up to interpretation whether or not they

441
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
That's our guns are safe music guns

442
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Or not

443
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Inherently threatening or that

444
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,296
Or that guns are no risk of actually being grabbed by everyone

445
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,184
But I think that I think that if it if it is saying that guns aren't

446
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Dimecuba

447
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Everything's going to be okay

448
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
That's true that that may be the only thing that we will have to deal with is half half a bar in a new state

449
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Will be very alarmed that

450
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
People going to come in

451
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
And the other half will be like yes

452
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
You should be alone but also

453
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
Everything's okay

454
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Control

455
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
Control your living room

456
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Definitely don't turn off daytime TV

457
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
More like guns are safe and structure is very unsafe

458
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
Grammar is under heavy attack

459
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
BBQ

460
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
As the delegate

461
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
Knowledge fight I would like to

462
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,064
Give you a very quick rundown of Alex's

463
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Dispositional

464
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Immigration

465
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Bad

466
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Real bad

467
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
Very bad

468
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Nobody should be allowed to

469
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
There are

470
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
Good immigrants

471
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
And then there are

472
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
Not good immigrant

473
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216
Which means there are no

474
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
You can tell the difference

475
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
Between immigrants and non

476
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
By sight

477
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Wink

478
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
Obviously the left is flooding the United States with him

479
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,528
Most of whom vote Democrat

480
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
Mind you they vote Democrat

481
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Because they want

482
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Handouts

483
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Not because the

484
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,232
The fascist terrorist organization known as the Republican Party

485
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
Thinks it's hilarious to respond to the question

486
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
What should we do with immigrants

487
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
With

488
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Shoot them

489
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,912
It's because of her

490
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Handouts

491
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
When the Democrats

492
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Consolidate their elected

493
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Replacing the good

494
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
God-fearing

495
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
Patriots who clutch their guns like pearls

496
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,200
They will institute there one thousand year Reich

497
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Wipeout

498
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Read that is why

499
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Immigrant

500
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
Are Central to the globalist plans

501
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
For reducing the world's population

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Conservative

503
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
By 90%

504
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,400
Immigrants control elections for the Deaf

505
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Step 2

506
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
The Dems take away our guns

507
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Step 3

508
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
Eradicate the population

509
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Could not be simpler

510
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,408
It also goes higher up still than the Democrat

511
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,736
Because they're not just going for a Merica they're going for the world

512
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
It is the UN

513
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
And George Soros

514
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,344
That no

515
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
From wherever it is

516
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Into the Western world

517
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
Read White

518
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
And start a civil war

519
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
By destroying the West

520
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
You take the world

521
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,496
Because obviously other parts of the world

522
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Never contributed

523
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
Technology or culture

524
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
Not a problem

525
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Just bringing in immigrants from outside the web

526
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,200
Is enough to destroy the country

527
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Now I know you're thinking this is about race

528
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
Because I've said it multiple times but it's not

529
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
This view is shared by many of his

530
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Frequent gas

531
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
Prominent

532
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Non-racist thinkers

533
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,328
For example Canadian would be politician Faith Goldy

534
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
British milkshake milkshake

535
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Canvas Tommy Robinson

536
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,568
Rhodesia loving apartheid-era carpetbagger Bob Chapman

537
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
And

538
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Whiny snowflake himself

539
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Ted Nugent

540
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,784
What a collection of totally not racist luminaries like

541
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
Please agree on something

542
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,880
We can be sure it is very much not

543
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
In fact

544
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
You thinking they're racist at all

545
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,512
Is Reverse Racism

546
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:58,400
After all Alex has said again and again that he is not racist for citing his love of live

547
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Latinx women

548
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
And

549
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,848
It is all flavors of immigrants that want fries

550
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
It's all immigrants who wants

551
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
Destabilize the mark

552
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Take our guns

553
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Kill poor innocent White

554
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
People without

555
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Knowing full well that the live

556
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,112
Wilton

557
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,392
Call you rate

558
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
The worst

559
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
The elite know this

560
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
And they set up the whole sequence of a

561
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,400
When immigrants come to America

562
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Patriots

563
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Have no choice but to

564
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Protect themselves

565
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
And their culture

566
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Take up their guns

567
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
What's wrong with that

568
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Thank you

You can't be racist cuz foreigners they can both horny and hungry.

582
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,528
I think it's rock-solid of not a racist

583
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,392
May or may not like Mexican music

The job is complete

602
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
Seth rich

603
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Shortly after his murder

604
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
What affiliation did they have

605
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296

Now they know more about Seth rich

616
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
A murdered DNC staffer

617
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,544
We recently dedicated

618
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Discourse Tysons

619
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,616
Immigration because

620
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
If we don't build a wall

621
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
MS-13 gang members coming to

622
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
The country

623
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,528
The country than the Democrats will hire them as Hitman

624
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,112
Hitman MS-13 well-off people like Seth rich

625
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
Busting Hillary Clinton for what she did to Bernie

626
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:07,584
Send off the Hitman that they brought into the country

627
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Country to begin with

628
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,424
Because their lives mean nothing and no one will ask him

629
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Questions

630
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Big complicated

631
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,080
You should never give a mouse a cookie

632
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,968
Never given MS-13 member Mouse in this case has MS-13

633
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,040
And cookie is assassination

634
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,576
Complete

635
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,904
The book in the first place

636
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,304
You just have to remember to blame Obama for quote release

637
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
MS-13

638
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Capture

639
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
At the border

640
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Something which of course death

641
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
We happened

642
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
Because we have multiple agents with

643
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
With kind of

644
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Giant Nets

645
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
Trying to throw them over MS-13 people as they

646
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
But either way Obama was like Naga

647
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
Catch-and-release make sure the hook doesn't lie

648
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Mike hurt their mouths

649
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,392
And

650
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
13

651
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
Healthy drop

652
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
Subsistence

653
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Exact

654
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,168
Yeah it's particularly angry about how much the deeps

655
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
Love's immigration

656
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
In June of 2018 Q made this

657
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
If you are smart

658
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Stupid

659
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,344
Parentheses

660
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
You know what you eating in Russia

661
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,000
Attempts to free Russia / Clovis

662
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Optics

663
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,304
Feeling

664
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
To keep POTUS away from

665
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
Enemies or Allies

666
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
America

667
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
Age of taxing our citizen

668
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,576
Across the world market

669
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,880
Over

670
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
World

671
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Gvea

672
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Rvw

673
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Read the Bible

674
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Claude Williams

675
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Shoe

676
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,616
I took a turn

677
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,200
You should have said spoilers

678
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,272
Like it's kind of a dick thing to do.

679
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
Spoiler alert the Godwin is it coming in the form of telegrams what do we do

680
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:47,840
Read the Bible

681
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Admittedly

682
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:55,008
Super aware of qanon stuff

683
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
Religious

684
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:02,176
Fundamentalist big aspect

685
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:08,576
You guys who have the 3 stars next to them and that stands for is the Holy Trinity

686
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:14,976
Hellboy smoothie if your if your blender doesn't work so you just shut up

687
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,536
Layered in there and never becomes a coherent

688
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Slurry

689
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
General Flynn

690
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:26,752
3-star General

691
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
It was like the Holy Ghost

692
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
I don't know that s*** but

693
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,784
One of the Stars I think my

694
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,184
The second one is also the Star of David & David

695
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,488
You are allowed to hunt people like myself

696
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,400
A reading of this is the general Flynn is the Holy Ghost

697
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
I mean

698
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Yes part of the trinity

699
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
The Holy Ghost

700
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,920
There's

701
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:10,272
Religion into like the ball as literal devil worship

702
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,064
They argue with Satan

703
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
And so

704
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,416
They're the white hats all the good people there on God's

705
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,816
Trump and Trump is like a soldier of God

706
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
The God has

707
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Chosen this

708
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
This

709
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Saggy grave of a man

710
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,008
You know I deliver us

711
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,104
From the onslaught of demonic entities

712
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,064
Maybe was little unaware of but this is a

713
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,368
Heavy overlap

714
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
Pizza place

715
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Easily

716
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Good good good

717
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
Cuz the idea here is

718
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
It's pretty simple

719
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
If you listen

720
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
That Q drop

721
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Or Testament

722
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Reloading immigrants

723
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Just want to taste

724
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
Sweet nectar of American freedom

725
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
But they're evil

726
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,360
That's why American citizens get tax so much when

727
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Traveling abroad

728
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
Logically in response to this heavy taxation of American tourists

729
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Totally exist

730
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,320
We must close the American markets

731
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
That's because the country is not just

732
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
The country is also a mark

733
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:23,488
We're going to create a virtual wall to keep out the market

734
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
And 200 ft electric fence

735
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
The fire turrets

736
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
To keep out the other car

737
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
This is a question

738
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Right vs wrong

739
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
And good

740
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Obviously we have to stop

741
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
DeForest immigration

742
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
Because if you read the Bible God is a huge winner

743
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,408
You really think God would p**** out and not fight the immigrants

744
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
Get real

745
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Friggin sleigh

746
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
The first testament

747
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,808
Is just God sitting on the border with Mexico

748
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,624
Double-tapping brown people until they all Rage Quit

749
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
It makes sense if

750
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
If you think about it

751
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,512
Either smart or an idiot if you don't get it

752
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
Anyway not getting it

753
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
But you also

754
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
Sometimes checks out

755
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Dirtbag left Twitter bios

756
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
And he's not happy that they want to abolish ice

757
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
That's why in July 2018

758
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
He made this draw

759
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Sorry she was too busy looking at

760
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Videos of his

761
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
His own.

762
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,264
Execute its mission to the enforcement of more than 400 federal statute

763
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Sportsman

764
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360

Https

766
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
Ice

767
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
Goodbye Democrats

768
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
You

769
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
Who knows that the best source of information about ice

770
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
Is there own website

771
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:10,496
Conspiracy theorist God

772
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,056
You can just link to the regular website

773
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,128
Obviously only morons would trust the

774
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,736
Dmsm

775
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,528
Sexual abuse

776
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Manslaughter and murder occurring with a nice

777
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,904
And X official speaking out about corruption

778
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Festering there

779
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
Give this delegation a break

780
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Crisis actor

781
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
Everyone knows that when you resign from Ice

782
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:39,168
Mossad and it's President George Soros to offer you a cushy 18 figure jobs

783
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
A lot of those Parkland kids for example use

784
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Used to be ice age

785
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:49,152
It's a Benjamin Button kind of tradition we can't let these X Ice Age

786
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Children

787
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Yeah abolish ice

788
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,552

Guy

790
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Goodbye Democrats

791
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
Unless

792
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Of course Obama and most

793
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,208
The Democrats turned a blind eye

794
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
And oryx

795
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Expanded ice

796
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
But not cool

797
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Cuz they're Democrat

798
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,960
The point is immigrants bad Democrats bad ice good

799
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
It makes no sense to Boston agency

800
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
She founded in 2003

801
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,104
During the reaction a receiver of post 9/11 America

802
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,688
We need to give these guys more guns and pay for their 14 word ankle

803
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
And that's our delegations

804
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Official

805
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
Except for one more thing

806
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
Antifa is involved here

807
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
They want to abolish ice

808
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,720
You probably don't know is that they're also not fans of white supremacy

809
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Punching pitos and Mike cernovich

810
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
If you think I'm having a stroke

811
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm not

812
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,144
In July 2018

813
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Q posts today

814
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,776
A photo of a protest at Columbia University where epic gorilla mindset

815
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,544
Who's going to speed

816
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:51,360
But the intelligent counter-protesters

817
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Have to do

818
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
They printed a giant protest

819
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Bigger and more powerful than all the other protests

820
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
They took boilerplate

821
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
Key Staffing

822
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
What's next

823
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Like the claim that the left

824
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
A few protesters

825
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,927
Are all members of

826
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,975
To the North American man-boy love associate

827
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
And they hate Mike sanovich so much because he

828
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,839
Anti pedo superhero

829
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
So they planted

830
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
And they got my turnovers to post

831
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Photo of it

832
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,799
And finally they made sure Donald Trump jr. saw these turnovers post

833
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
Which will make him

834
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Epic drops

835
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Like this July

836
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
2018 July

837
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
Welcome to the new borders

838
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,879
Through keto destroyed

839
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
Antifa

840
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
The Democrat Party

841
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Dark

842
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
To life

843
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Q

844
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
I don't think this delegation needs

845
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
House

846
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Stupid

847
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Gullible

848
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Our followers

849
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
They never check to see if

850
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
The sign and Bean

851
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,615
Stage-right information office another smear by the Mockingbird media even if they did

852
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
It's all one big family

853
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Corporate media the

854
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Antifa

855
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
They're all just layers of the deep sea

856
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
Structure

857
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
Event on November of 2018

858
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Beast mode

859
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,159
He posted a New York Times article

860
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Call showing a map

861
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Of the electorate during the

862
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
Election

863
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Crossword

864
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,583
Areas with illegal immigrant

865
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
You might be shocked

866
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
About white tees

867
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
Why they care more about

868
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Did you

869
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Specs matter

870
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
The reason the Democrats love immigrants

871
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Immigrants

872
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Haven't been thoroughly in

873
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,319
By Fox News

874
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
For several days

875
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,903
That means they refused to vote Republican which

876
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
Of course the huge sign that they're having their mind hijacked by the

877
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
State brain drawings in their all-bran

878
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
Or a 2%

879
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,679
OSU Patriots

880
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
So

881
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:08,575
Encourages researching

882
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:15,999
Research little self on the ice website cuz people really follow up

883
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
But those commands

884
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
From what I've experienced

885
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,583
Like listening to

886
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Good stuff

887
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
So you're probably asking where their other posts

888
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,799
Maybe cleaning the judicial and or an anti-immigration movement

889
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,639
Or the open borders and a dislike of ice is a war on sovereignty

890
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,943
Or just did nationalism is good

891
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Absolutely there are

892
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
Will the delegation P dressing goes

893
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
Absolutely not

894
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:51,071
Almost

895
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:56,191
The god that is all for whatever it is they're doing at any point

896
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:01,055
I know about the Bible Old Testament

897
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
Yeah

898
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
I'm shocked

899
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,879
The between what Alex believes

900
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Professing

901
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
Yeah I mean it turns out that

902
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
Underneath It All

903
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
It's just brown people bad

904
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,839
Yep yep

905
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
The base we can build

906
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
You think so this could be that The Rock

907
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
This is like

908
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Thing that certify

909
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,359
Underneath everything

910
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Something's by

911
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
But Brown

912
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Today

913
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,783
Alex Jones and having a nice dinner together

914
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Possibly

915
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
Touching feet under

916
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
The table

917
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,951
This is our tomorrow

918
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,791
We can live happily ever after screaming about antifa

919
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Fairy tales.

920
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,959
Yeah it's it's also important

921
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,055
He adds in there like the antifa is evil because another underpinning

922
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,591
Alex is that

923
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,407
All Democrats

924
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
Basically race-traitor

925
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
In other people if you're not supporting

926
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Getting rid of

927
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:19,647
Illegal immigrants are you say that make me uncomfortable

928
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Yeah race

929
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,327
Traitor is a tough

930
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Phrased

931
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
Say out loud

932
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:36,031
And put our conversations honestly and put out a public podcast

933
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
Your parents may or may not listen

934
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
2

935
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
When I almost every morning

936
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,783
When I almost finish a marathon I always turn to the guy my right he's going to make it in

937
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
Throws up

938
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
What's the stick

939
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Bicycle

940
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:08,031
The bad guys in breaking away

941
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
Speaking of a stick

942
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
The wheel of a bicycle

943
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,807
Easter Brothers

944
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
When we talked about the podesta brothers

945
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,887
Of course we're opening up the door to talking about pizza

946
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,239
And ultimately that means we're going to have to touch on the very important matter of

947
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
Literal demon

948
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,991
Pizzagate Alex was all about investigating globalist

949
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,599
Most likely abusing kids there

950
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Employee

951
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Rainbow

952
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,975
Took Aleve

953
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,303
It sorry but it's this delegations belief that you are making this personal

954
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
I wish it was

955
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:11,007
He doesn't always go by Rambo Joe big but I'll be damned if I'm not going to always call Matt Matt

956
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,295
Your weirdo with a periscope account

957
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
What's a Comet Ping Pong

958
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,415
Kicked out for the staff

959
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,815
Who's been dealing with frequent death threats recently by acting suspicious and live streaming forgetting to

960
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Close to the truth

961
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,119
Dependent

962
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:43,263
Interviewed on Infowars about how he got such a creepy vibe there

963
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,383
How suspicious it was today

964
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:53,247
How he saw kids running all over the place possibly in and out of secret room

965
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:02,719
Because I hate myself I did watch that entire Periscope with him going to, to eat and I did not see

966
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,559
The things that he was describing

967
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
Which I didn't think was that

968
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,423
I just f****** love like this guy reinvented himself

969
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
As one of these like

970
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,983
Like stocks and logic

971
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
Journalism guys

972
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,359
And he's the guy who was just live streaming from inside a pizza joint going on

973
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
I'm pretty sure it smells like pedo in here

974
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,991
Yeah it's real impressive

975
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
Career art

976
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
We should all be so lucky shrink

977
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,927
American American life has so many chapter

978
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,839
Completely changed

979
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:44,191
Text podesta emails are real

980
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
But the globalist

981
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
20 people to the pizza place as a diversion so they wouldn't sign

982
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,151
He was pretty insistent at the time also that you would never into pizzagate

983
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
And even went so far as

984
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,759
To take down about pizzagate from his YouTube channel

985
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,063
No one really knows what caused the

986
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
The ship

987
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:07,231
Some really far-out conspiracy theorist to pointed out that just before he changed his story

988
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,791
Vegeta Comet Ping Pong owner

989
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:16,191
In order to avoid defamation lawsuit

990
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,495
I think we can all agree that do sound like coincidence

991
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,663
Whatever the case is here one is very consistent is that Alex thinks

992
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
Podesta brothers are Crypt

993
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,575
And most likely engaged in child trafficking and possibly the ritual sacrifice and in

994
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
Of human children

995
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:38,719
Industry with pretty much the entire Democratic Party

996
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
Are George soros's son Alexander

997
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
Robotics age

998
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:53,055
Alex is not ready had podesta emails that were at the core of the whole pizzagate thing

999
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Due diligence

1000
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,663
Enough about the topic on weird blocks to be able to rip about it

1001
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:03,295
In one of the emails Marina Abramovic invites

1002
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
Spirit cooking dinner at my place

1003
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
She said she's looking forward to it

1004
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
In the business

1005
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,487
This is what's known as a smoking

1006
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Gun

1007
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:17,119
The globalist Marina Abramovic

1008
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Performance art

1009
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,679
Known internationally for decades

1010
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
For creating provocative pieces

1011
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,591
He'll tell you that the right-wing media intentionally conflated various vaguely occultic

1012
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
Installation she's made

1013
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:33,503
Over the course of her career with a dinner party she threw for people who donate to Kickstarter

1014
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,807
Including

1015
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Stop showing up to

1016
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,207
Dinner party

1017
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,303
Adidas has conflated these they are these two things

1018
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,887
In service of creating a style conspiracy

1019
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,167
To attack Hillary Clinton

1020
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
When they tell you

1021
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
But the right-wing can play these two things together

1022
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
I want to try that

1023
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:07,039
Yeah I want to try that didn't show up because you probably just ate

1024
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Too much at home

1025
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Before you know

1026
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
I think I think you probably didn't go because there were no bread I think probably email

1027
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Are you going to be serving

1028
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
I like they do a Panera

1029
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,471
And they said no I don't we don't have any bread bowls just regular

1030
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
No thanks

1031
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
I'm trying to do the opposite of cutting down

1032
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,407
Reality these dinner guest

1033
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
Gorged on food made of blood in semen

1034
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,551
Making a mockery of God as well as traditional flavor profile

1035
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:47,743
I know this sounds crazy cuz you got to think that food not tasted good but you think it's not

1036
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
It's about ritual

1037
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,327
These people like Marina Abramovic

1038
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Hillary Clinton

1039
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,447
George Soros is one song that Alex knows about

1040
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
Commence

1041
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Literal demon

1042
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,871
Serious jumping around with pitchforks demon

1043
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
This is not a metaphor

1044
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
Think of it a killer Bob from Twin Peaks

1045
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
They're like that except they can

1046
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,831
Keep your s*** together long enough to legislate

1047
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,647
Which is scarier than killer Bop

1048
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,487
Killer Bob could never round up the votes needed to pass a gun control bill

1049
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
You see

1050
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:26,399
It's all comes back to adrenochrome

1051
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,031
These demons puppets to destroy the world

1052
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,615
Able to communicate with their puppet

1053
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,663
Problem

1054
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,759
Really high

1055
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,087
They've got to be high on a specific called adrenochrome

1056
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
These demons Commander puppets

1057
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
The kidnapped children and torture them

1058
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,279
In order to frighten their pituitary glands into releasing enough adrenaline

1059
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,071
So their blood is full of address

1060
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:01,727
End up being able to commune with their demonic shift

1061
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
Managers basically Monsters Inc

1062
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Someone

1063
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
Monsters Inc

1064
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,015
Literally used as a meme in the qanon community

1065
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Describe exactly

1066
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,159
Afraid of court

1067
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,487
Are they secretly f****** with

1068
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,703
The child can I possibly create enough adrenaline to turn its blood into a drug

1069
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,287
You can easily buy synthetic adrenaline completely legal

1070
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
Good high remember

1071
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
They are mostly globalist

1072
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,551
So to sum up Alex's position

1073
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:52,927
Drug

1074
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:55,743
Who give them marching orders that tell them to destroy the world

1075
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,071
Mostly by meddling with a free market and trying to take Alex's gun

1076
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,191
Also Alex is not thrilled with Tony podesta choice in paintings and sculptures

1077
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,471
This is really

1078
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
A place where we are going

1079
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
Feel

1080
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
The bonds of

1081
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
The Brotherhood

1082
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:19,551
Worries me as a human outside of doing this podcast

1083
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
A boy but yes

1084
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,791
I did not go very deeply with adrenochrome and now that

1085
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Torture

1086
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
Occurs but

1087
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
You're completely correct

1088
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
Across the line

1089
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,471
Contestation

1090
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
R-pod

1091
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Our delegation

1092
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Call sit adrenochrome

1093
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
And yours

1094
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,639
Adrenochrome but I think that's the

1095
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Just the British

1096
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,431
First American

1097
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,015
Podesta Bros

1098
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
Earlier

1099
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
Episode of ours that we did

1100
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,415
Discovered that there is a text startup company

1101
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
That does sell the blood

1102
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,023
Of a young human

1103
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
Two older humans

1104
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,703
I think I got shut off for a while though

1105
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
Subscription Service where child shows up in a box up for a subscription fee once a month

1106
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,279
18 to 25 year old to do to the economy being so shity are pushed into literally emptying themselves

1107
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Is there blood

1108
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,607
Live longer it's not at all

1109
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,263
First year that we did our podcast I needed to sell my blood in order

1110
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
So I'm

1111
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
Very familiar on being on the business end of that

1112
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,687
The whole podcasting industry only is able to exist

1113
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
Because we all sell our blood

1114
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,271
Plasma center

1115
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,807
I feel cold

1116
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,463
Official sponsors of strangers

1117
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,791
Play that on the podcast until we reach 4000 a month

1118
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
Well I'm on our side

1119
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
And representing this delegation

1120
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,727
I'd like to see a lot

1121
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
To say about the

1122
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
Podesta Brothers

1123
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,151
Mailman

1124
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
Very earliest days

1125
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
There are more good

1126
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,807
The Wizards and warlocks

1127
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831

Otherwise 70% of elected politicians

00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:39,647
They shot Reagan and it scared him away from fighting the Deep state

1166
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,047
And the mistake is that they let these to.jfk and Reagan

1167
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
Become president not knowing that they were going to try to

01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
No Escape

1319
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
No Deal

1320
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,239
Update

1321
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
View

1322
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
The wait wait

1323
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,127
He's like I love your graphic

1324
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:26,527
Can you please add bread into Photoshop

1325
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,111
I said payment

1326
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:36,511
I have one more quick notes

1327
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,327
Enough enough

1328
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
Jail

1329
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,887
One more

1330
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Maybe

1331
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,239
Talk with the color scheme a little bit

1332
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:52,895
Lower the contract up the gamma make sure that you were non-destructive

1333
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:01,599
In March of 2019 when John podesta Zealand from jail

1334
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,903
He was interviewed by the local press and said

1335
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,999
The rumors were the HP and I were running a child

1336
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,303
Horn ring which had no basis

1337
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
Send anything

1338
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,935
But a guy showed up with a gun and ended up shooting up a pizza parlor

1339
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,519
It is the police this delegation that where there's smoke

1340
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
There's fire

1341
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
That's why his followers under

1342
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
Understood that when Q posted a Twitter thread by a guy called

1343
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Birds 534

1344
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,735
About podesta's New Zealand tour

1345
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
Anons immediately notice

1346
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
A wild coincidence

1347
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
The thread

1348
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
Was posted

1349
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,927
Exactly eight days before the New Zealand Christchurch

1350
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,487
And everyone remembers

1351
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,535
The guy had podesta emails painted on it

1352
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
What's gun

1353
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
I think the case

1354
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Has been made

1355
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,679
John and Tony podesta are pedophiles who are both in

1356
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,959
And out of jail

1357
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
Running a vast child trafficking Network

1358
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,287
Hidden behind

1359
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,335
Innocuous food-related word

1360
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Yum

1361
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Allegedly

1362
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
But you have none the less

1363
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Good sirs

1364
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Back to you Fred

1365
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,647
I expected there to be bombs to pick but

1366
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,511
Very little

1367
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Shades of green

1368
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,887
Yeah this one is I think our biggest overlap yet

1369
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:22,239
Alex tries to not talk about

1370
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,519
These sorts of IB

1371
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,847
Adrenochrome

1372
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,407
Hidden behind other

1373
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
Other top

1374
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,759
Other things we talked about

1375
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
He only brings those up when he wants

1376
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
Impress someone like Eddie Bravo

1377
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,719
A big trump card

1378
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,815
Where is it

1379
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Is much more into like

1380
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,655
Throwing this out pretty regularly

1381
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
Yeah I think that

1382
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,543
You know because Alex Jones is somewhat of a public figure and he has a

1383
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,383
The face to put in a face to go with

1384
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:06,783
You know I think you're right that he sort of holds back I'm a super crazy s*** just cuz he knows

1385
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
It's already kind of

1386
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:14,975
What the public perception is it in

1387
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
Second before we insult

1388
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
The people are delegation

1389
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
Our representative

1390
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
I would like us to

1391
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
To read something

1392
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
Inclusion in the formation of the

1393
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
One state solution

1394
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
That we discuss

1395
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
Of course it will be a period of

1396
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
Time during which we

1397
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
Have kind of offline

1398
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Discussions which might

1399
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
Accidentally be recorded before now I recommend

1400
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
We move towards

1401
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
Single-state solution

1402
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Do I have

1403
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
The okay for our first

1404
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,183
Topic guns

1405
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
It does it seem

1406
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,047
Like keeping all the guns in the country making sure they're in American hands

1407
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Stockpiling damn

1408
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,423
And then using them on anybody who isn't American and also confiscating any

1409
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Non-american guns

1410
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
What's coming in

1411
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
Putting them in the transmogrifier

1412
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,799
Making them American

1413
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,847
And generally staying

1414
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
Incredibly alert

1415
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
I'm thinking that everyone's trying to steal your guns while also ignoring

1416
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
School shootings

1417
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
It does that

1418
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
Is there anything you see wrong

1419
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:16,159
As long as absolute ism

1420
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,719
I think we could reach agreement there

1421
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
Absolutely

1422
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Acceptable

1423
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,327
As long as you guys also promise not to

1424
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,631
In the use of the 20

1425
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
5th Amendment

1426
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
To remove our God

1427
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,799
Okay well then I think we found Common Ground there

1428
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
We can move on to

1429
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Our second issue

1430
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Immigration

1431
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
Pretty simple one really

1432
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Immigrants

1433
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Bad

1434
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
Legal or not

1435
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
Illegal eyes

1436
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
Dreamers

1437
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Stop.

1438
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Go home

1439
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,583
White wall

1440
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,863
Biggest wolves

1441
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,423
Armed guards at wall malicious

1442
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
Growing

1443
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
Morgan's

1444
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
Snipers

1445
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,519
Scopes

1446
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
F****** night vision

1447
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
Mine

1448
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
Tripwire's

1449
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Drones

1450
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
IR sensor

1451
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,367
As long as it is only applied to

1452
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Exactly

1453
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,463
Okay no United States

1454
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,215
Okay well as long as you're saying Democrats are

1455
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
You know

1456
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,799
Immigrants from here on in and they get that status

1457
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:46,271
Foreign usurper from hell

1458
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,039
Pinterest app

1459
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
Thirsty

1460
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,367
Dying Democratic family

1461
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,391
As they attempt

1462
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
To cross the border

1463
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,743
Hold them at gunpoint then shove them under a bridge and make them sleep in

1464
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
Security blanket

1465
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
Until you know they die

1466
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
Then we're fine

1467
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
Fantastic

1468
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
To Arthur

1469
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
Probably even less

1470
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239
Just point

1471
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Which is

1472
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,055
John and Tony podesta

1473
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,319
Have you guys

1474
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,623
Seen the spinoff

1475
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,671
Podesta conspiracy theory

1476
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,487
That the lead singer of Linkin Park

1477
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,303
Chester Bedingfield

1478
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,911
Killed him say that he's really the illegitimate son of

1479
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,447
John podesta

1480
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,335
And that he was working on a documentary about to expose human trafficking and child abuse

1481
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,871
And that is why

1482
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
He was killed

1483
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:48,479
Late and associations we have a delegate on the Cuban on side

1484
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Throwing some

1485
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,807
Sticks into the wheels trying to slow down the process

1486
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,207
I have it I'm just to try to derail these talks

1487
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
I'm going to put this cash in my wallet

1488
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:08,959
Look on your take your mobile telephone device

1489
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Right now

1490
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,543
Chester Bedingfield

1491
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
John podesta and tell me what you see

1492
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
Chester Bennington

1493
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,039
This delegate is not a huge Linkin Park Fan.

1494
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:27,391
Lean heavily more to the Weezer side of the table

1495
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:33,791
This a delegation would like to point out that

1496
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,847
Attempting to broker but you cannot discuss a John podesta

1497
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:50,687
Without also disgusting his illegitimate son

1498
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:56,063
Subsequent murder suicide

1499
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:01,695
Well well if not heard Alex bring up this particular illegitimate son conspiracy

1500
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
It is arson

1501
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,447
Not if you would not be opposed to it

1502
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:18,591
Absolutely

1503
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Sebono

1504
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:25,759
Well then you know without further Ado I would like to offer and put on a table

1505
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:29,087
A one-state solution one country under God

1506
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,391
Qanon Alex Jones

1507
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
2

1508
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
Council members

1509
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
That rule over us

1510
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,279
In dialogue with

1511
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
A congress

1512
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,095
That is filled with

1513
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,423
You know citizens but only American

1514
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,703
Course only white American

1515
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Patriots

1516
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
And they can vote

1517
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
Find

1518
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,639
So yes can we agree to this single-state solution

1519
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,199
With what

1520
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,015
If that is the qanon please stop

1521
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Talking bad about Alex

1522
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,231
We will need that confession from you

1523
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,023
Qanon does not seem to like it but

1524
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,815
It's it's been a long

1525
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
And

1526
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,655
Stupid War

1527
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:19,007
Do you know yes sometimes missiles are fired from our side

1528
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:24,639
Into your side Q's Alex Jones

1529
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:28,479
But we would love it if we weren't you know housing open-air prison

1530
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,503
And

1531
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
You know cut off from

1532
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Supplies

1533
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Both Medical

1534
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
Elementary is that okay

1535
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,951
We can I think we can agree on I think we can agree to these terms

1536
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,255
Will even accept the grammar issue

1537
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:45,119
Alright I'm sliding it across the table to the

1538
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:03,807
I've been on the air for 25 minutes

1539
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,367
Information

1540
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:10,975
The most important information I've ever covered the truth

1541
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,399
Who they really represent V

1542
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
Your folks

1543
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Tricon

1544
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
Right in the

1545
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:30,943
Blueprint what they're fine

1546
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,735
You ever been in your kitchen

1547
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:34,783
You open up

1548
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,575
Richard Fox gone

1549
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:47,327
Sun-rising you look down the valleys

1550
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,143
Never had one of those magic moments

1551
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,263
What is the opposite of antifa

1552
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:01,151
President

1553
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:06,015
Smoking

1554
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,575
I hereby declare

1555
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Nothing

1556
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,231
So close

1557
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
Believe in God

1558
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,263
Garbage juice

1559
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,543
Isabel

1560
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,839
I'm seeing Santa Claus

1561
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
Your brain is made

1562
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,151
I can't I just can't

1563
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Dammit

1564
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:29,215
And now some coverage of a sale 2019

1565
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,567
Knowledge

1566
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,431
I can't believe that broke down at the end

1567
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:45,343
That's the true disappointment lot of progress there

1568
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,415
My life

1569
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,303
I just hate to be called

1570
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
A little shity

1571
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,863
Teddy baby

1572
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:02,495
How you know it wasn't meant to be you know I thought that you know what I think it would really sealed it was

1573
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
Was that your culon calling Alex Jones

1574
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
The Patriot

1575
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
Pay3x

1576
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,623
F****** headphones were taken off of me

1577
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,415
I mean

1578
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:25,279
Well

1579
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,119
Talks broke down you're concerned about what

1580
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,751
Well Alyssa Lies

1581
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,799
Wouldn't even notice you were gone

1582
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
Okay anyways

1583
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,199
A lot of fun fellows

1584
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,503
You know like I said at the beginning

1585
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
We've had requests to do

1586
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,111
Crossover it's it's a bizarre one because our topic

1587
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
Pixar so similar

1588
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,951
In many ways

1589
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,535
Because Alex has to get up there every single day Q lazily rights

1590
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
Like two drops every week or so

1591
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
And

1592
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,399
So you know your guy is way more

1593
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
Public facing he's going to get

1594
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:07,007
Dude you know he can have people sue him for what he's saying

1595
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
Where is qanon

1596
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,311
Way more of a coward

1597
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Hiding

1598
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
Anonymize

1599
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
Kaiser posting on 8th

1600
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Chan

1601
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,247
But I am glad that recently we heard Alex kind of reneging

1602
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,063
There are some things that are true some things that aren't

1603
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
Accu is good and that he

1604
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
He's he has to eat

1605
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,647
Eat crow by the way

1606
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:27,743
Has he eaten any Crow since you mention that during his like collar that

1607
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
Who loves q and wanted to kill

1608
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,471
No not really he's

1609
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:42,591
I think after he said that he was expecting a Q and The Q followers to be like

1610
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:48,991
Isn't this great we got Alex on our side now and

1611
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,271
Overtures

1612
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,343
And so he got mad and said that most of them were full of s***

1613
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,671
Like a week later it was like

1614
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,767
Seems like a tiny footnote and I did not notice anybody in the

1615
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
Qanon Community even reacting to it

1616
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,911
Probably just cuz they don't really listen to Alex and if they do they like great

1617
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
But they don't

1618
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,727
I not going to go online and discuss

1619
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,799
I said Travis did you notice any Alex Jones talk after that.

1620
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
Seem to want to renege on his

1621
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,640
No no

1622
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Just dropped after

1623
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:25,344
I've always thought of Alex's kind of like a gateway drug for these sorts of

1624
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,624
Mental processes

1625
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:32,512
And I think getting into Q requires a lot more investment no give you got a like

1626
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,352
You use pretend critical-thinking skills you have to

1627
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
Read

1628
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
Ostensibly

1629
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,448
You have to hunt down these things

1630
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Where's Alex

1631
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,032
Cuz you're served to you on a screaming silver platter

1632
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
So

1633
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,848
I don't I feel like anybody

1634
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,384
Actually

1635
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,152
Getting into

1636
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,176
The Q research

1637
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:53,504
Quote it past the point where they

1638
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
Really

1639
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
Have any interest

1640
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:04,000
If he doesn't recognize that if he does realize that he's angry about it but he also probably

1641
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,304
Doesn't realize that that market is not open to

1642
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,840
It's true that we might be looking at the

1643
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
The kind of

1644
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:15,008
The Wayne of non-interactive non gamified you know system of cancer

1645
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
Alex is definitely

1646
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
Play the king of at least

1647
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
In America

1648
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,664
And then you know the need for something to do

1649
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,456
Due to not just sit there

1650
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,528
And get screamed at because you're obviously boiling with rage and

1651
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
Fear at the end of it all

1652
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,600
And you'd love to turn that into

1653
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
2 something where

1654
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,392
Are you feel involved in

1655
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
Maybe that's why she went on came in

1656
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,976
I mean yeah it

1657
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
It provides the like the illusion of activity

1658
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,608
Right Alex

1659
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Alice Eve

1660
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,424
Kind of dedicated to make

1661
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,704
I'm sure his audience remains

1662
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,288
Except for paying him for supper

1663
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,104
So everything is already being done

1664
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
M4u

1665
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,176
As long as you give him money

1666
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,968
Then he will fight the fight for you

1667
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:56,992
You know that kind

1668
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,296
Where is it seems like with qanon

1669
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,576
People are active

1670
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,856
Participant

1671
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,136
In creating the mythology

1672
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:10,560
Unearthing I guess I can't remember the last time that Alex advocated anyone

1673
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:14,144
Somebody

1674
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,728
He doesn't Advocate anybody go to a protest

1675
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
Never said

1676
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,080
But anybody should vote I don't think he's ever said

1677
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
Did somebody should go vote

1678
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
In order changed

1679
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:29,760
Call baby for truck but not

1680
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:35,648
People in Mobile but also just looking online at stuff I think

1681
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,488
The shift and and how conspiracies are becoming more gamified I need

1682
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,376
Start a little part of Infowars it was called like the dick or something and I'm sorry.

1683
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
Spell cuz like trouble for a lot of people on his message boards talking about

1684
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,080
Stuff like that

1685
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,432
I think he got kind of burnt didn't want that much engaged

1686
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
Is Vans

1687
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Like whenever

1688
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,344
See videos from time to time if I'm running into his fans

1689
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,160
Doing everything to get away from you

1690
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,024
He's about use a dinosaur insensitive like

1691
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,072
He's old school and he doesn't want

1692
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,656
I do agree that I think it probably would be

1693
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,520
For him to turn his business model into something at work moving forward but

1694
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
I think it is just

1695
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
You can't do it

1696
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,432
PS4 something like almost like

1697
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,968
Russian bass Super PAC

1698
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Does not know

1699
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,296
According quote does not coordinate

1700
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
With Alex Jones

1701
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,624
What is doing its own thing on the side

1702
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,744
How balikesir you know

1703
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Conspiracy

1704
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:51,168
You have no proof the Rambo Joe Biggs didn't leave in order to do exactly that startup

1705
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,568
Discussion

1706
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,336
For doing this

1707
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,616
A huge leak

1708
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,176
Avicii went on Great Awakening Discord

1709
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:05,248
Give me run by Dustin Nemo's

1710
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,784
Who's quite a big

1711
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:07,808
Your figure

1712
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,392
In in the Acura. Industry

1713
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Right yeah

1714
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,768
It it's it is very much

1715
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,352
Understandable that Alex would want to kind of

1716
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
Endorse

1717
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
Discount discussion

1718
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,424
Because

1719
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,728
The amount of insane

1720
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,800
Anti-Semitism stuff stuff is just like literally

1721
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,592
The Jew

1722
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
The Jewish

1723
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Cartoon caricatures

1724
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
Rubbing his hands

1725
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Together

1726
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
There was

1727
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,784
There was one that was just

1728
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,112
You know what would you rather this or that and like one side was

1729
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:44,160
Like the Nazis and the other side was like

1730
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,440
Tifara something

1731
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,744
That's it that's a more direct

1732
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,280
Hey, like we loved Nazis

1733
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,096
He's then usually that like antifa is the real not

1734
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Cease but

1735
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
Jeffy's this discussion areas get in

1736
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
Incredibly talks

1737
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,704
To break quickly

1738
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,728
Understandable that will

1739
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
Be hard to

1740
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
Do anything about it

1741
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,104
Yeah yeah I think it takes

1742
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,664
Controller

1743
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
The control that he has

1744
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
His narrative

1745
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Be too attached

1746
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,320
2

1747
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,368
That over anti-semitism

1748
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,928
Over Nazi apologia

1749
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,696
Where at

1750
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:21,792
You can control however he presented self even though presentable poorly

1751
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
Show

1752
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,144
But he's not going to get burned by a Discord leave

1753
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,960
The whole the whole thing

1754
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
Is that is that you know what

1755
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:34,336
Like you don't need to rely upon any particular media Source anymore

1756
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,896
You can you say do your own Reese

1757
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,248
You can confirm your own personal biases

1758
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,808
The idea is that you don't have to rely upon

1759
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,880
CNN or even like

1760
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,952
Alex Jones cuz they're they're doing the same thing in their kind of

1761
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,232
Skyview Weather Service

1762
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,768
Just tell you what's going on

1763
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
And they're kind of tell you what

1764
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,632
Directions

1765
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:02,752
But yeah it. Yeah they that the vision of like how people surf understand

1766
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:09,408
Edit people discover the truth for themselves

1767
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,736
It's a difference in tone like

1768
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,296
Hear que se investigated

1769
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,624
Yourself it does seem like he's actually saying you should go invest

1770
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
Alex will say

1771
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,488
I'm up

1772
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
Question

1773
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Format is like

1774
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,072
Please don't actually go look at

1775
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,144
Basically

1776
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
These peace talks were funded by the

1777
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
The knowledge fight

1778
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
Qanon Anonymous Park

1779
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,672
You can find both of them

1780
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952

Qanon anonymous

1784
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,400
We like to think both of these

1785
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
Generous emotional labor

1786
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:07,008
We can neither confirm nor deny that Alex Jones was

1787
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
Shorting these peace talks

1788
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,640
Thank you so much guys for 4

1789
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,176
Agreeing to do this with us

1790
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,880
Alex
