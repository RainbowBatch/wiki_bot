1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,056
We are a couple of dudes who likes

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,848
To sit around and drink wine

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
I know a lot about

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
It's very lies the fun we're on how many episodes

7
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Still don't know anything about

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,536
Infowars I think you know more about it than a lot of people who listen regularly

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
I think because of your

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,400
B******* detector your awareness of History

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
I've been building up today's episode

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,384
I can't I can't begin to describe your face

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Is lighting up like

14
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,200
Christmas f***

15
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Independence

16
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:56,576
This is insane there is a reason and I am thrilled

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
There's a reason for this

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Today we are going to be

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Be covering

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
M24

21
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
In the Life of Alex Jones

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,864
The coverage of the Alex Jones Show

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Homeagain for Wars Network

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
And this is a show that I would like

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
Like the call

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
I would like to start trying to give our episodes

27
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,016
Is what it is

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Doobie

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
A roller coaster ride

30
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Alright it's

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
It's fun

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
Idaho

33
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:41,376
Instead of deeply at the end if you want to follow us on Twitter at knowledge underscore fight

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240
If you want to reach out to please describe on I would appreciate it we are both

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
I have a feeling

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
That are showing

37
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Are going to become

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
Way more relevant

39
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Inexplicably

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
And also it is both

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
And

42
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
That we are suddenly relevant

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
Yeah we might

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,464
You sound really smart with your friend

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
I asked Alex Jones becomes more and more mainstream eyes

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Like it's like

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:18,496
Being a hipster but for the apocalypse like dude I was in the Apocalypse

48
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Tipster

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,176
I was a podcast before the Nazi thing

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
Do you like the shows

51
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Tell your friends about it Word of Mouth

52
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Ludacris album

53
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,768
Word of mouth so I'm going to I'm going to break

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
Traditional me to put my

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
My personal handle out it's all my God I was driving earlier

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Today

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
First thing I thought was

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Borgata

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Deathreats like to see how that goes

60
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
I bet you won't I can run and I made sure that it only got put on P

61
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
People's Twitter walls who have a college

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
Georgia diploma

63
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
Eventually we're going to have to

64
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
David the Infowars

65
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,656
Possibly we might have to confront our fears and actually tweet at them at

66
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,984
At some point sooner but for now let's enjoy

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Looks around

68
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Let's get to the fun

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
So Monday

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
The 20th

71
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
Classic Alex

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
In the studio

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,088
I like

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Alex

75
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
You are

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,184
People

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Might do a pirouette at any moment while it is why it'll make sense

78
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Time

79
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
We'll get to my

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Encompass

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,080
I hate that I slipped off the broadcast on Monday

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,896
Complaining about the new season of Homeland

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,016
Call here at the office a few months ago that the

84
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Popular TV show

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Was going to be coming out

86
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
And is based around me

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,839
And I'm this evil talk show host that puts out this information and causes disasters

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Just a pause for a second

89
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Bullshiting

90
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,495
No he's not know there is a character that

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,103
Very clearly based

92
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
That's a classic Alex Jones embellished

93
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
Later in the show he plays a clip of the guy

94
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
And he's like

95
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
You know taking umbrage

96
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
At this guy

97
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
You know playing hit

98
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Version of him on television

99
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,023
Let me play a clip and his guys just talking about the club list

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Everyone needs

101
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Share links to Infowars

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
It's literally do they even sound the same

103
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
The guy is doing a bad impression I think I could do better

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Quite frankly

105
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
It's like

106
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
The guy just says that there's globalist

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
And that people should share link

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
And that the spirit of the Republic is coming back

109
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
You like that

110
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
Yeah I like I also hope that that actor just

111
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
It's Alex

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
I'm doing research for a row it's just for

113
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,471
Like a Gerard Butler did with Adam Carolla

114
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,335
The one f****** movie clip about Homeland

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
And I think it highlights one really enjoyed

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
We've documented

117
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,015
Doesn't really know the difference between reality and

118
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Fanfiction

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,903
And it turns out I don't think he knows that other people can tell the difference

120
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Which might explain a lot

121
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
Seems to think that everybody thinks

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
But it's actually him on the show

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Really

124
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
So look

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
Eerily similar to have a picture of it I just heard the audio but anyway here's that

126
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,343
Also that is the article that he was talking about the photographer on our life

127
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Episodes

128
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,999
One part of that is confirmed there were pictures of pictures of him

129
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Detox

130
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
So much more about this article later

131
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
And we'll get to it because it's a glowing positive review

132
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
I'm good

133
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
People believe I'm on the show

134
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,199
And they believe that I am now working with Showtime

135
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
To put out this information freckles playlist

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
No

137
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
When did others

138
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
Muslim

139
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,431
And covering up basically Terror attacks that that that that that other group carryout

140
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Is he on The Big Bang Theory now

141
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,135
For the parody character to be

142
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Framing NFL

143
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Muslim

144
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Kind of metaphorically what

145
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
And then covering up terrorist attack

146
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
False flag

147
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
When he does say everything is a false flag

148
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,519
Legitimately I would not be surprised if this is just

149
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
Transcript

150
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
From one of his shows

151
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
Is all of this guy's lines are just reading down

152
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
The play is

153
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Really

154
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,551
Aperitivo

155
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
But also did

156
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Today

157
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
When the New York Times articles

158
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
Came out the sister of one of the kids killed it

159
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Sandy Hook

160
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Yeah and was like

161
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Disgusting

162
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
This is a man

163
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
Who denies the murder of my brother

164
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
That's the that's the kind of thing he says of the false flag

165
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Go fly a kite

166
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
But the thing that I can

167
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Seeing was

168
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Referring to

169
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
To that as being a

170
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
A seminal moment and that is terrible

171
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,743
I hate that

172
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
He's so much more crazy than that

173
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
You guys don't know

174
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,751
Yeah you don't know the nuances and little stuff

175
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
It is but also I want to make this argument

176
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
And I think it's going to

177
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Overarching

178
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
This entire episode

179
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Part of the reason why I brought up

180
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
When you said those things

181
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
He did not have his free-speech taken away

182
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,023
One of the worst things you can probably

183
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
Do or insinuate is

184
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
That all of these murdered children are fake

185
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Write someone was

186
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
Was all the family members

187
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Of these kids got her ass

188
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Yep and they got

189
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
They got death threats

190
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
But you're part of a mask

191
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
To cover up all this stuff

192
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,367
How could you imagine a worse tragedy than your child dying

193
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
Sing I can think of being shot

194
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Having your child

195
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Murdered

196
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
And then

197
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
After while you're trying to grieve

198
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
People are giving

199
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Death row

200
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
What is wrong with Humanity couple of dumb people who don't get it

201
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Character in The X-Files

202
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
The new series

203
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
Ankle was based on it turns out there's a lot of people who are inspired by his version of craziness

204
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
Covering up false Flags

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,815
And the boys sounds enough like me in the trailer

206
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,703
Sellout for a show

207
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,663
Play the part of me

208
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,991
Upon fake

209
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
It's

210
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,599
Fake

211
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
It's Fiction it's just a TV show

212
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Creative

213
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
S*** yeah

214
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,863
Well within the parity law

215
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Who is who is

216
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
King him

217
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Like why did you sell out

218
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
Maybe his lawyer

219
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Remember his lawyer didn't know if

220
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
People kicked out of the lawyer

221
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Documents

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,367
Are you home

223
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
They don't have to

224
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
They don't have to

225
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
For that dude

226
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
They're basically using

227
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Trademark

228
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Work yelling about global

229
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Good good

230
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,823
I also also we just looked at a picture of the actor

231
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Nothing like

232
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
I recognize that dude.

233
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Stuff

234
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Can't for the life of me place where they

235
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
Monday goes on

236
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Alex Jones

237
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Argumentation

238
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Bisquick

239
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Okay

240
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Is spectacular

241
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
Because he accuses other people of misusing sources

242
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,399
Which is his bread-and-butter it's all he does

243
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Then

244
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
He argues about people making a straw man fallacy

245
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
And then without missing a Beat

246
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
Makes a straw man fallacy

247
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
The visit

248
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:04,223
This clip is arrive some kind of superhero

249
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Being a

250
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Complete and utter moron

251
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Yeah

252
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Yeah

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
I can wait till we get to Tuesday

254
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
Mr Show verifiably

255
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
Easy to disprove

256
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,471
Is that a bunch before saying like

257
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Oh you said you don't know Russian agents

258
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
That must mean that you don't know Rodger Stone

259
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Good Rogers

260
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Deep ties to Russia

261
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
So the idea is

262
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Style of argumentation

263
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
You know it's just a classic

264
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
Syllogism

265
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
If Aven

266
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
You know Rodger Stone

267
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
Rodger Stone has deep ties to Russia

268
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Therefore you know someone who has deep ties to Russia

269
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Alex doesn't understand this at all

270
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
Ethological

271
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
You don't understand the point

272
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
Or you do and you're just trying to murky

273
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
Do the water

274
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Basic

275
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
Your basic trick is just

276
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
Then maybe

277
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
I mean his followers are just going to believe whatever it is

278
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Double and quadruple

279
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
And triple down and just don't

280
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Rodger Stone and Russia

281
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,735
Yeah first he never says Rodger Stone

282
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
In the tree there's not even the nest

283
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Computer

284
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
Like no it's not

285
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
I know a better metaphor

286
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
If you want to come over there for someone

287
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
Claiming a source says something but it doesn't

288
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
Go to any of our episode listen to us explain every time

289
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Avetta

290
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
The Perfect Analogy

291
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
I saw a bluebird

292
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Nest in the tree

293
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Resume

294
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Wait

295
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Are you

296
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
Are you looking in the right place is that the real issue

297
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,991
Are you looking still in your stupid

298
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Alrighty so

299
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
Pictures of psychological

300
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Warfare tactic but

301
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
By his own admission right there

302
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
He engages in psychological

303
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,471
Yeah but he really just be praising the tactic being like

304
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
Hey everything they're trying to do is what they're saying

305
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
This is a psychological warfare

306
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,247
As evidenced look at this giant screen behind me

307
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
Look at the fact that I've called all of you with bone pillow

308
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
I guess it premiered last night

309
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
And

310
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,383
Because I guess they start out the first episode where you don't see me I haven't seen it yet it just sounds like my voice

311
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
He's totally

312
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
But again

313
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Doesn't say you don't see

314
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
The character

315
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Simi

316
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
He doesn't understand the veil between

317
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
Fiction and reality

318
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,351
Entirely upon him and so far

319
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
It kind of

320
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Yeah it sounds

321
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
It's crazy

322
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,871
Sorry I actually give him a pass

323
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,479
But I'm still going to keep

324
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,111
Perfectly described what the guy looked like but he was just looking into a mirror and described

325
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,927
Looks like a chubby pug

326
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,047
Haven't slept in months

327
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,175
And it's just like I have to defend myself against its that this isn't me

328
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,903
The whole bunch of newspapers variety and

329
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Egypt

330
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,047
Entertainment Weekly

331
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Again he has no idea what numbers are

332
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,335
But the other things in there if it's important for what's about to come up is this idea that he's like

333
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,639
I have to defend myself against

334
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
This

335
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
Defend yourself against vet

336
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Insecurities

337
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:39,839
Or something like that is Illustrated something about himself that he's uncomfortable

338
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
His entire existence

339
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
Possibly

340
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
His defense like

341
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
He has to come to terms with the fact that

342
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
This guy

343
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
Is a propaganda

344
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Who's falcon

345
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Conspiracy theory

346
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,735
Yeah so he's looking at himself

347
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
And going

348
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Wait

349
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
If I were watching

350
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
This I would think this guy is crazy

351
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Yep

352
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
I think people think I'm crazy

353
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,791
At least enough people to make a TV show

354
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
There's a lot

355
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,959
Kind of a funhouse mirror

356
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
If you if you at once we have corn

357
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,639
Right if you are walking behind your clone it's like looking at your own ass being like

358
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
I got to work out

359
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Yeah but

360
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
But I think also says

361
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Defend myself against

362
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
And then immediately his next thought is

363
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
People are saying

364
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,559
Alex you're crazy

365
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
No one saying that we all are very clear that there are

366
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
The character on the show

367
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
He's the most

368
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Character on the

369
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
In The X-Files was not the most

370
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Important care

371
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
It was not Fox

372
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
Smolder

373
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
5th or 6th

374
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
Season of it and I'm sure that it's just

375
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Part of the Ark

376
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
For the season

377
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
Becomes

378
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
Or maybe Dies who knows about it

379
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,015
He's got to get back to his Galaxy

380
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
Letter dice

381
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Pictures ideas about hubs

382
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
His character is a straw man

383
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
How it's stupid

384
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
To do straw man argument

385
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
Then he's going to misrepresent what a strawman argument is

386
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
And then he's going to commit

387
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,359
I was so fascinated because I was like knows what a strawman argument

388
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
The next thing you said was

389
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
And he gets

390
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
The strawman argument

391
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Call Chris Carter

392
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
But nobody listened

393
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,119
I got the Press reading cuz it's all like liberals

394
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
They just make up these

395
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
Bob the kickboxing done

396
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:12,575
We got one here in the office

397
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,928
Object

398
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,584
The pinata I'm saying Michael Moore and I'll beat it up I didn't really beat up Michael Moore

399
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
They realized it

400
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
So

401
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,800
That's what he thinks astro-man is

402
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
I don't understand what he was talking about

403
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
I'm just excited

404
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,576
Good to know that they have a punching dummy in her office of Michael Moore he could

405
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
Beat up Michael Moore

406
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Strawman

407
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,416
That's not

408
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,280
I want a very very metaphorical bases it kind of is

409
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
If you create a fake version

410
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Michael Morton rhetorically attack

411
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
Then yes but it might as well have

412
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Beat-up avhs

413
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Copy of the Wicker

414
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
Destroyed a straw man

415
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,200
If you save that Chuck Schumer is a vampire and then you attack him for his vampirism

416
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
That's kind of a strawberry

417
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
All Liberals are

418
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Of the globalist

419
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Who are trying

420
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Destroy the country

421
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
From within

422
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
And they've openly said that

423
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Instead of

424
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
You do engaging with liberal ideas

425
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
You're just creating some

426
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Some sort of

427
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,104
Imaginary but hey dude

428
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
If Bob

429
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
The punching dummy

430
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
He lives in

431
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Is the point

432
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
And here's a new one

433
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,120
Safespace

434
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,936
Just basically don't even talk to me

435
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,336
We're coming into jobs and you can't never criticize me or I'll have to

436
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
And this is what they're pushing this is what they're doing what they're doing

437
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
Anybody who knows what those

438
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
Safety pins are about its

439
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,352
Trying to signal to people that I will be an ally for you

440
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
If somebody

441
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
You can count on me to defend

442
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,008
That is the idea of the safety pin

443
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
His argument is

444
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
I'm a cuckoo bananas person

445
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
It's clearly that people

446
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
Every liberal

447
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Think Steve Jobs still alive

448
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
The same way the globalist

449
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Frozen

450
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,264
You can't you can't criticize

451
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Who

452
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
If you criticize me

453
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
I will see

454
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm glad you picked up on that

455
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Important to remember

456
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
Okay

457
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,112
Just remember that you complaining to be snowflakes

458
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
And

459
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
You will be right

460
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:37,120
Now we are going to take a little tour through the rest of the time on the episode where Alex

461
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Precedes

462
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,984
To be every negative thing that people think about

463
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
This first clip

464
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,592
Shows off a little bit of his islamophobia chops

465
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
To New York City

466
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,208
You showing video of a protest of March there where people took the

467
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Sometime too

468
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,048
Appreciate and enjoy

469
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Muslim prayer

470
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
Take a moment of silence

471
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
To recognize

472
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
One of the world's largest religion

473
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
Respectfully

474
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Yes and Alex

475
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,592
Really is not happy about

476
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Show solidarity

477
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
Celebrating other people's cultures is a delightful thing

478
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
To do it's like wearing a

479
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Safety pin that looks like a

480
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,464
The boy

481
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
I think I left this in cuz it's really nice

482
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
It is it is kind of weird

483
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Any religion whatsoever

484
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
I like that

485
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,552
Throat sound

486
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
There is a

487
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Reason that religion kind of resin

488
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
I do have some ideas that kind of drift

489
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
Sexual in a weird way

490
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:22,592
She probably cut today up

491
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,968
This is a FedEx this is a cockle

492
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,856
This is really anti-christian anti-freedom anti-west Society

493
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,672
Enter the group

494
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
The women then put on 1011 they put it on the news

495
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
Look how beautiful this is

496
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
Does he get to the clip of a woman

497
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Allahu Akbar

498
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
Prayer

499
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
March

500
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:04,832
Yeah

501
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Doesn't mean that the

502
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
The phrase itself is

503
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Go with you

504
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Are you

505
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
Yep you are all phrases

506
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Is there bad okay

507
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,840
I couldn't tell if you're being sarcastic

508
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,144
But it's the same thing with like

509
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
You know it's

510
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
It's it's a harder argument but

511
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,032
In some unknown hateful contacts

512
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
A swastika isn't defensive

513
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
You know in like Hindu traditions and things

514
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,760
Okay now I'm back on physical shape of it is not what defensive

515
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
If the connotation

516
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
And do you suck

517
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
Yeah the phrase Allah Akbar is not offensive

518
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
Someone is shooting you yelling

519
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
If you were yelling

520
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,096
Pretty much anything while you're shooting

521
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
I'm going to take that in

522
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Breakpoint that's a good

523
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
He always goes on this long

524
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:02,176
Think it's cool to have Jihadi boyfriend

525
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,504
Talking about

526
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
I did not know that

527
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,136
Cuckolding their f****** nationality

528
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Leading the race

529
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah

530
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Will because

531
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
What don't you get

532
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
All things

533
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,960
White genocide narrative

534
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Okay still there

535
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,616
Cuckold p*** online is all essentially black and white

536
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
It's good stuff

537
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
I'm not against

538
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,504
But that's the depths of his understanding

539
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,112
It's always white men being humiliated by white women dating

540
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
Absolve

541
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,328
Is that what is he saying that all white men should be

542
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Humiliated

543
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
When a white woman dates

544
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Anyone not

545
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
I think that's

546
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Implied underneath what he

547
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,568
But I don't think he even knows that he believes that enough

548
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
That's pretty much

549
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
White National

550
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
He is advocating

551
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
Full on segregation

552
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
No miscegenation

553
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
I don't know if he was just not being careful with his words

554
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Is always

555
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
I mean everything I say

556
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,792
Even when I'm

557
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,888
He gets into a little bit of a combo platter

558
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
In this next clip

559
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
We get to

560
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Enjoy a nice ride through

561
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
Three of the greatest hits

562
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
It's like the taste of Chicago

563
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Homophobia

564
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
And

565
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
Haribol exploit

566
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
Native pedophile fear-mongering

567
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
To avoid

568
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
I think he does

569
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:53,792
Play Upside Down

570
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
Premacy

571
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,776
Everything is anti-white anti-west

572
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,824
Even though almost everyone of them

573
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
This is mass mental illness

574
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
If you are against

575
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Dismantling whites

576
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Supremacy

577
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Fat fat

578
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Really bad

579
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
And if that means

580
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
And if your argument is

581
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,072
Isn't it crazy that they're against white supremacy and they're all white

582
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,448
You really might be missing the mark

583
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
You should be

584
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Not against whites

585
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
Yeah yeah

586
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
The very least

587
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Nutrilon

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Or else you might end up

589
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
This is what you pay for it the colleges

590
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
This is what goes on

591
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
I need to see the type of women

592
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Only somebody else

593
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
Come up

594
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,008
In front of you

595
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,848
And they can't believe you're like a backup

596
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Royal

597
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
I want to go to women's bathroom can vice versa

598
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,000
The backyard of your five-year-old says they want to go

599
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,688
Star Wars

600
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Your child allowed to love

601
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:55,904
California

602
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,352
The Voice

603
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:11,008
Let us have sex with him we won't have to kill him and throw him in a shallow grave

604
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
It's your fault we got to kill kids

605
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
It sounds unbelievable

606
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
But it is

607
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
This is who were facing

608
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
It's your fault

609
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
We have to

610
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
To Kil-Kare

611
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:38,144
We should probably isolate that for an out-of-context.

612
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
What's the next

613
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:47,360
A policy wonk

614
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,664
Tequila kid

615
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
We would love we don't want to

616
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
We just

617
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Really have to

618
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,904
We file the law with the UN every time Alex Jones speak

619
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
We have we have to

620
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
It hurts us more than it hurts

621
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
But you understand the logic that he's using their right

622
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
Repeat the logic he's using is

623
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,264
That look all these pedophiles really want to do is have sex

624
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
For kids

625
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
Because they're not allowed to

626
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
They got to put them in a dungeon and kill him

627
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,736
He thinks that liberals want to allow people to have sex with kids

628
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
In orders that they don't

629
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
I have to kill them

630
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
That's crazy

631
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,928
Especially considering that he defends Milo

632
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,584
Who now has been outed as someone who was literally defense I was I was just listening to that car

633
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Clip gun

634
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,656
This is before the viola

635
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
Information about us

636
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,336
I won't lie that plays into What A Difference A Day Makes

637
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
Talk about Bi-Lo

638
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
It is

639
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
If you guys didn't hear

640
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
Number of Clips came out that

641
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
Have been in the public

642
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Sphere

643
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,280
Like a lot of it was from his appearances on a boiler alert

644
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Snow

645
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Talk about

646
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Five-year-old

647
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
Kids he's not

648
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
Milo's talking about his owner

649
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,240
Experience of having sex with adults

650
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
13

651
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,568
Not recognizing

652
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
His victimization

653
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Right

654
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,712
He's not recognizing that the other person had an adult brain

655
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,992
At all

656
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
And because

657
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
He makes it so fine in the waist

658
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,416
He is constantly saying

659
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Is it okay

660
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
Absolutely

661
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,144
It doesn't say it's okay

662
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
It says you have to

663
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
If you have to you have to go

664
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,480
That's where it starts because I promised him candidate always starts with Star Wars

665
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:06,880
Absolutely the globalist put a lot of pedophilia imagery

666
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Kill the Younglings

667
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:20,192
With broccoli

668
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah so that's the best

669
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Crazy f****** b*******

670
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
3 clips

671
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
We've heard rampant misogyny homophobia

672
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
Transphobia

673
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Islamophobia

674
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Again

675
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know how many times I'm going to say this

676
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
It is not allowing men

677
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
That's not what

678
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,984
And if you are in a woman's bathroom

679
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,824
If you're in a men's bathroom as a transfer

680
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
There is a

681
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,968
You are the one who will be sexually assaulted

682
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,528
Yes I mean

683
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,088
There is zero chance that goes the other direction

684
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,184
Documented

685
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,744
Nothing is 0 but

686
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
For the alike

687
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
This or trans for the incident

688
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Some bad people

689
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,312
Some bad Hombres doesn't automatically make you a good person

690
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:32,384
Definitely doesn't make you a bad person

691
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Very much

692
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Is a

693
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
It makes you a person

694
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
Train people

695
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
I still

696
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
Hundred percent

697
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,000
Want to make this clear

698
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,328
Okay our show is not about trying to get Alex Jones

699
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Kicked off the air

700
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,424
I hate the things he says

701
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,008
Yes but much like a vote Voltaire would say

702
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
I defend to the death his right to say them

703
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
Yes he is a crazy a*******

704
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,920
Another crazy a******

705
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
But I'm not interested

706
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Despite all of this hates

707
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Interesting Lee enough

708
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,136
If he was Spencer

709
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
We wouldn't be allowed to play his clips

710
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
Yep right

711
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
And if he was legitimately censored

712
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,864
There would be a part of the show where Our obligation would be

713
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
To defend

714
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
That's true

715
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,496
And I would stand behind that obligation

716
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
Now

717
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
All of that hates me

718
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Yes

719
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
Transitions into

720
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Of course

721
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
What I would call

722
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
Some of the worst

723
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
Sketch comedy I've ever seen in my life

724
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,368
So he's got a new reporter named Billy Weaver

725
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Who is making

726
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,440
YouTube videos Annie discovered her

727
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
And brought her in

728
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
So she's as newest reporter

729
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
I don't know what the fuc

730
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
Convinced him that this was a good idea

731
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
But she comes on the show as a character

732
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
On Alex Jones Show

733
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,568
The character as a character called rainbow snatch

734
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Called rainbow

735
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
Who is a social justice Warrior

736
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Okay

737
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,856
One from My Little Pony

738
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,232
I feel like there's a character on my little pony named Rainbow snatch

739
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:28,864
One way or another has run afoul of copyright law

740
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Rainbow snake

741
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,192
There's no other way to take

742
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
So rainbow p**** is

743
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Number one

744
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Seems awesome

745
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,504
If Ever I found one I would be like there's a birthday of my life

746
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
Horribly out of line with his brother

747
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Has anything like this ever happened on

748
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,000
Experience

749
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Time that Alex Jones

750
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Did some skin

751
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
Play How It starts

752
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
Broadcast

753
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
Rainbow snake

754
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,928
I'm sorry but

755
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
As we all know rainbow snakes

756
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,656
Snitches get stitches

757
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,472
This is terrible

758
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
F****** long

759
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
It's so long but please

760
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,896
Enjoy how bad both of them are at character-based Improv

761
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Literally

762
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Minutes before this

763
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
He was talking about how legally you are

764
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
Have to let your kids be taken by pedophile

765
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
Dura level 1 Second City

It's all about Pettyfer

767

So serious

768
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,120
They're going to snatch up your kids

769
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
They're going to rain.

770
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
I appreciate you joining us

771
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
You're racist

772
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
Okay well we finally got one of you to come on the Joe

773
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
Riverbank

774
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,736
Seriously

775
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
We do what

776
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,952
I just want to say that all you Trump supporters are bunch of racist

777
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
I never heard that before

778
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Really

779
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,424
Pessimist

780
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
Do you need address me by my proper pronoun okay because you can

781
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
Call me

782
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,104
I want to be called

783
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
V

784
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:53,504
What happened

785
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Nope

786
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,672
Excuse me but that is extremely racist

787
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:05,792
I identify as a multisexual transdimensional

788
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
He brought back the cupcake

789
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
That seems to be his go-to

790
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
So there was no last

791
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Yes and

792
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Was

793
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Thrown away

794
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Athan

795
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:27,808
Response

796
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Respond to something else

797
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Starting to

798
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
Just a totally unrelated set

799
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:32,928
Right

800
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
Or like you ask me a question

801
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:39,584
Call me I'll be rainbow snitch

802
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
Rainbow snitch

803
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:44,192
How do you feel about liberals

804
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Good point

805
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,175
I can't believe

806
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
I have to think that

807
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
When they were doing it they were like

808
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,807
F****** nailing this

809
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
Because you watch Alex Jones

810
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
He looks like a

811
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
The cat-that-ate-the-canary

812
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
He is

813
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
So thrilled selling it well

814
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
No

815
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,327
If he actually heard that he was

816
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
V

817
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,167
Long rant

818
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,239
Astonishing

819
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,823
I also

820
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
But anyway

821
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,479
Did you about this when I was watching

822
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,343
And I want to reiterate this Theory just in case something comes out down with line

823
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
I think he's f****** this girl

824
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:40,511
I can't think of any other reason he would let this on his show it's so bad

825
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Maybe just once

826
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:49,215
That could be it to American Beauty thing as opposed to the end of American Idol

827
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,567
So we're saying that he's masturbating the shower a lot

828
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Yeah

829
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
I think that's probably

830
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,967
Yeah it's so totally different than anything he does

831
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,039
Enough to be a reason for it

832
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,343
That's the only thing I can take a hot young girl

833
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
Comes in

834
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
She said transdimensional witch

835
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,463
If I were him in this scene

836
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
He would be like

837
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Well that's a

838
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
You said that makes a god

839
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
Yeah

840
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
Yeah it's so bad it goes on forever

841
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
How many talks to Jerome corsi about a bunch of bulshit

842
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,055
But he has an interview later with the Motor City Madman

843
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
It's just

844
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
Eclipse

845
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Assume what he says

846
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,503
I love God

847
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
I also love God

848
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
I like how your voice down

849
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,183
I like to read a couple of Ted Nugent quotes

850
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
Just remind everybody

851
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,559
Should not be in the Senate even though he choked it'll be fine

852
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Established my position

853
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,399
80s rock stars in the

854
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,215
What's a feminist

855
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,775
A fat pig doesn't get it often enough

856
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
8 Ball

857
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
Boy boy

858
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,687
Yeah when he was interviewed in 1990

859
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
I said to this

860
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
About South Africa

861
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,575
Me being there isn't going to affect any political structure

862
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
Besides apartheid

863
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,695
All men are not created equal

864
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Whoa

865
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
Well

866
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,559
You know what here's what I will say

867
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
All men are not

868
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Created

869
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
Here's another one that's a little bit harder

870
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Defend

871
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
I use the word

872
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
Edward

873
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
About that you said

874
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
The Edward

875
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
The real word

876
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,879
I use the word use the word and this is where this is where we cut out the part where we

877
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Play 20 minutes

878
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,743
Is it okay to

879
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
YouTube MTV and I'm not going to walk that line right now I use the word n a lot because I hang out with a

880
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,447
And they use the word an

881
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Communicate

882
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,663
That's just a poor leak

883
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
He also said that Barack Obama is a piece of s***

884
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Anyway

885
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,631
Metal rockers

886
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,959
Wango Tango

887
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Man.

888
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,663
Name the song Agenda 21

889
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
Okay anyway

890
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Let's not talk more about news

891
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,271
Now it's time to get into

892
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
February twenty first

893
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
The Milo news

894
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
Has broken noses broken

895
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
The New York Times story has come out

896
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,791
And boy is the world looking differ

897
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
Just going to play this clip

898
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
And see what the

899
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Consequences of life

900
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:08,127
Doing

901
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
I don't know

902
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
Five six times in big

903
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
Article just last two weeks

904
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:18,623
Dr. Rogers reporting out of this gym

905
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
And Britain calling for shutting down

906
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Realize that I

907
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,151
But still

908
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,479
I knew it would be in the paper physical X

909
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,575
Woken up

910
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
So

911
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,159
He is so delusional

912
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:56,511
When we believed when they said they want to

913
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Down fake news

914
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
He meant everybody but

915
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Or everybody but him and Breitbart in the light

916
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
I don't understand this phrase

917
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,543
So what was going on there is

918
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
Did the interview is because

919
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
They were talking

920
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,663
And they said we have a goal of shutting down

921
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Fake news

922
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
So he

923
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
The interview because he's like

924
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,927
Without any self-awareness that he himself

925
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Is the

926
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,255
Piratey of fake news

927
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,863
I have a little theory that I have no basis I don't have no

928
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,799
Rodger Stone told him that he could work out okay

929
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,895
Yeah I think that Rodger Stone might have

930
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Set a trap

931
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,503
God dammit

932
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
I don't think Rodger Stone was trying to hurt

933
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:59,999
He was doing was trying to create negative

934
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Press

935
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
For Alex

936
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
So Alex

937
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,071
Play the victim

938
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Okay

939
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
That is what we are

940
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
2 levels deep

941
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,983
Or

942
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,079
Let's go through I'm going to go I'm going to go

00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
Nazi Germany

957
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,599
Telling your ghetto you can't have businesses anymore

958
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,047
And he said I was

959
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Free speech

960
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
They're coming after it

961
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
In 2016

962
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
We're in 2017 and I have congressman

963
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
On television

964
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:30,111
And that they want a law passed

965
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
They play that clip it's not what they saying at all

966
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
Trump should have

967
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
His Free Speech May

968
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Yeah

969
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
That's

970
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,911
Play clip from senator

971
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
I don't think so

972
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
I'm going to go with

973
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
Let's go with you

974
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Why not

975
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
But they're going to go after

976
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Drudge's free speech

977
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,759
And they gave him a heart

978
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
Something I don't know if the Supreme Court

979
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Has ever done

980
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
So-so Scalia is

981
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,143
Yeah that's why I got killed

982
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
Forgot

983
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
OSHA

984
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
That's the narrative Alex Hotel

985
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
Now we're going

986
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,199
Sponsored

987
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,087
It's Google app

988
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,047
I was thinking it was like it was some kind of alcoholic

989
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,887
See I was thinking it was our secret hacker

990
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
Know who is finally decided

991
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Nowhere secret back

992
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,031
Immediately

993
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
But it's not

994
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,615
It's Admiral Admiral

995
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
But

996
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
It's a very serious deal

997
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
How much

998
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
How much money do

999
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,831
You don't get into that a little bit later to eat so that's benefits

1000
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,855
I apologize

1001
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
You can't talk at all because I had to

1002
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,719
But I don't know why this clip is playing real low

1003
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Compensate

1004
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Alright

1005
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:17,119
Also

1006
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Tennis Twitter

1007
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,983
He can't read those and interact with the public

1008
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,543
Twitter is being gamed again

1009
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
President

1010
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
The president is also on the 9th

1011
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
60 switchboard

1012
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,967
I also forgot that I was explaining

1013
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:36,831
About about the guy wanting to send

1014
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,183
Free speech is it talking about how the tradition

1015
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
The phrase enemy of the people

1016
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Peasant

1017
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Sync Lineage 2

1018
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
Yeah I'm Trump needs to be careful when he uses terms

1019
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Have

1020
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
Traditions that go back to Stalin

1021
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
Especially when you're talkin about

1022
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
The Press

1023
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
At the very least

1024
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
What the senator was saying

1025
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Is

1026
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Don't

1027
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
Say things

1028
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Dictators have set

1029
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Yeah

1030
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,319
If you're going to act like a fascist dictator

1031
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Not much we can do

1032
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
Good idea

1033
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Say it

1034
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
It really if you distill it down

1035
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
The message is morphe cool

1036
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,815
If it's not stopping its pace

1037
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,911
You know what I would vote for any senator who goes on TV

1038
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
Like dude

1039
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:28,799
Chill into the interview and chill

1040
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
He loves it

1041
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Somebody always did

1042
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
Erasmus family

1043
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,111
Donald Trump

1044
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
Criticized

1045
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,631
They're the fake news they're the collapsing news

1046
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,679
Answer is

1047
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Trump

1048
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,111
Warther heating up against

1049
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,423
Total War and spread the links and the Articles from the more

1051
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,567
Is there

1052
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,175
The whole episode

1053
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Becomes Annex

1054
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:43,551
I'm going to sue everybody

1055
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,343
Somebody criticize him

1056
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
Right and

1057
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Is going to sue them

1058
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
I actually took a screenshot

1059
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Correct

1060
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Cupcake

1061
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
Yeah

1062
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,007
I took it I took a screenshot of

1063
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
The

1064
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
They supposed letter

1065
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,223
But he got from the Admiral if you want to take a look at this this doesn't look like any letter you get in an official capacity

1066
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
I mean look at that header

1067
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,879
There's no way that header for support of Donald

1068
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,183
Play Trump from major advertising

1069
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
The fakest s*** I've ever seen

1070
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:30,399
Adan terrible MS.

1071
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
Here I'll just read the entire thing

1072
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,639
I apologize for the lack of communication here prior to pause and campaign

1073
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
Infowars has been flagged by the Admiral policy

1074
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
Result campaigns

1075
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Suspended

1076
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
Remember to protect

1077
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
The privacy of our site vendors

1078
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,903
Are Parker ad networks as well as the national advertising

1079
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Have

1080
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:00,095
Our partner ad networks as well as the national advertising initiative have strict policies

1081
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,655
Retargeting user segments

1082
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,191
Stop potentially sensitive information

1083
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,055
All content on your website should be relevant accurate informative and up-to-date

1084

Any claims should be easily verifiable

1085
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
We're not able to

1086
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:15,711
To promote websites that intentionally misrepresent their business

1087
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,991
Peruse

1088
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
Supposedly enhance reputation

1089
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,551
Or misdirect

1090
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,319
Actual offer

1091
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Furthermore

1092
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:28,255
All political content should focus on the special interest

1093
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,559
Special interest or group

1094
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,607
Or imply affiliation

1095
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
That last part

1096
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
Is what he does not understand

1097
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,263
Here is here's the other thing

1098
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,847
Look up the national advertising

1099
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
It is a sin

1100
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
Regulatory Prince

1101
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Couples

1102
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,807
Which Nai members must agree to uphold

1103
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Maybe members

1104
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,439
Yep

1105
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Selfridge

1106
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
Is the self-regulation at all

1107
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:08,959
Why I don't know about any of that I don't know if he's lying about stuff or what

1108
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
That letter is

1109
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:15,359
Just like a copy and paste job so they can add that header on which I think is possible

1110
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,711
Cuz there's no way they got a letter that said we're Banning you because you support Donald J Trump

1111
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,343
Instead of what we

1112
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
What we know that

1113
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,207
Bi Nai uses

1114
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,095
I would love to

1115
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
Cease and desist

1116
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,935
Comic Sans

1117
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
Wingdings

1118
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,055
Stop vdi park there the

1119
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,127
Any political content

1120
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
You know...

1121
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
Cannot apply affiliation

1122
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
Yeah that's important

1123
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,087
Because he is essentially a wing of the Trump campaign

1124
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
Yes

1125
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,183
And especially now that Trump is doing campaign rallies again

1126
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
Which is bananas

1127
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,511
And Alex Jones

1128
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,071
Constantly about how he talks to Trump

1129
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,887
Right and that article in the New York Times

1130
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Explicitly

1131
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
Laid out

1132
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,751
Him bragging about talking to Trump

1133
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
It correct

1134
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,615
She can no longer imply that he is not affiliated with Trump

1135
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
Arrow

1136
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
According to

1137
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,479
The document that he showed

1138
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
Has every right

1139
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
Not to allow their service

1140
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
Supposed to be used

1141
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,415
Real

1142
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,023
I don't know but we're just we have to

1143
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,071
You know you have to dance with the one that brought you

1144
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
And if we got it we got to talk about the actual instead of the actual

1145
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,823
Enough about the advertising contract their sign

1146
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
We can only go on what do you provided

1147
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
And based on what you provided

1148
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
He doesn't understand

1149
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
The letter that he puts on screen

1150
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
Do they have

1151
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
AJ

1152
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Contract with Admiral

1153
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,695
Cookies in your computer and they

1154
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,999
And so if you go to Empire Court

1155
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
If you go to

1156
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:14,911
If you go to infowars.com

1157
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:19,519
You'll see a bunch of their weird super male Vitality caveman ads on the site

1158
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,079
Then you start going to other websites

1159
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,895
You'll start seeing Infowars ads on those other side

1160
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
That's how

1161
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
Adware work

1162
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
Essentially

1163
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,551
This visit the service

1164
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,343
Yes they have a bunch of

1165
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
Spaces on Tom's website

1166
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
That they have a

1167
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
It's this really weird system

1168
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,279
But because you go to their site

1169
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:46,143
Infowars you'll now start this is what's been taken away for

1170
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Nothing else

1171
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
No one is answering him

1172
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,823
No one's taking away his free-speech now they're just saying

1173
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
You are now a wing of

1174
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Administration

1175
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
And you can't use our server

1176
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
It is

1177
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,039
I do not stand up for him

1178
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
On the ground

1179
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,647
Also I think he's

1180
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Pretty much fun

1181
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,231
I don't think they can even really do that

1182
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
New York

1183
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:16,095
I mean with citizens united as long as he doesn't actually

1184
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,423
I'm not I'm not even going to pretend I know what I'm talking about.

1185
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,519
They probably didn't do it because of the fake letter and he gets to play the victim

1186
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,847
But maybe they did do it and I don't know why but

1187
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
You're playing fast and loose

1188
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
What you need to realize is

1189
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,735
Is this real cops

1190
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,783
For Alex what you spelled out in disc

1191
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,879
I would hate to Molly's Echoes of Alex Jones conspiracy theories

1192
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
The message wasn't

1193
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,511
This is all the New York time

1194
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
Coming out

1195
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,375
In the article

1196
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,703
New York Times comes out and says that

1197
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
Alex Jones

1198
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,079
A funding

1199
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,151
That's a pretty

1200
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Shear

1201
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
More

1202
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,135
Exposed

1203
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,975
Nancy Pelosi W bush still the president

1204
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:21,375
Nevermind

1205
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,423
He still talked about that clip

1206
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
But you get that three points

1207
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
$3000000 number

1208
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
Route and that sounds

1209
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Like that's a real number

1210
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:38,015
3.3 million dollars this morning

1211
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
That's a good day for all of us

1212
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:48,767
Excited I wasn't worth

1213
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,119
I hate reality

1214
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:57,983
He's one of the worst people in the world not encroaching on his free speech

1215
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
This is a business

1216
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
You're no longer within the terms of our service

1217
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,431
You're gone

1218
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,527
Targeted me because of my affiliations and I'm a libertarian

1219
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,367
Brooke knows that I mean unless one of the implied

1220
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,927
Essential pieces of you being a libertarian

1221
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Is

1222
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,559
Do you violate their service

1223
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
You know what he needs to do

1224
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,143
What's that in Mexico

1225
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,191
Carlos Slim money

1226
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,215
What you got to do

1227
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,031
So It Goes On

1228
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,079
The rest of this episode

1229
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
Legitimately

1230
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,151
It's him screaming about needing money

1231
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Cons of interviews

1232
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,111
Because he can't handle filling time talking about news

1233
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:51,231
Jerome corsi in in Washington

1234
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
Broke

1235
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:56,351
He's f****** broke he might not have an angel investor

1236
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,143
Actually I think there's two possibilities

1237
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,495
Which we'll get to I also got some theories as we go along

1238
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
But I want to be clear

1239
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
Jerome corsi

1240
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
Is out in Washington DC

1241
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,967
And it really feels like he's pulling whoever is in the hall and to do an interview

1242
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
Begets Informer

1243
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,807
The guy who is in the Senate

1244
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,367
To come in there and talk about how he's going to

1245
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:24,767
Spell dirt on the check

1246
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
He's amazed

1247
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,399
You keep know he keeps saying he was the vice chair of the sub

1248
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Committee

1249
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,959
It doesn't really spicy

1250
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:39,359
Activia Senator Senator Senator okay what's his name

1251
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,503
It again but then he gets like the guy who published Rodger Stones book

1252
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
7 interview

1253
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,087
And it's all just

1254
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Search

1255
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Aston Township

1256
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,975
They're all just like

1257
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
Your

1258
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
They're f******

1259
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
They're all pan

1260
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,375
Yeah they just lost

1261
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,191
Million dollars

1262
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
Wow

1263
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Great

1264
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Next

1265
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
Is it

1266
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,895
Sales pitch

1267
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
That money

1268
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,415
You know one of the things that I

1269
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,559
What are the things that I think is

1270
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Implied and Alex

1271
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Cuz he's just pitching

1272
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
The entire show

1273
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,495
Right is it I think he knows that a lot of is traffic that he gets to his website

1274
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543
And a lot of the traffic to gets

1275
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,663
Like I think he knows that he knows that there's a very limited

1276
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
But he has to work for

1277
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
Okay

1278
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Kind of a feeling that I get

1279
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
End it

1280
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,599
Desperation mode

1281
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Here's my theory

1282
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
You going to be fine

1283
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Probably

1284
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,863
There's going to be an investor

1285
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,191
Alexander

1286
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,287
This might be the best news ever for Russia

1287
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:24,063
Did you just have the same thought I did hear yours first Rodger Stone to set up

1288
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,159
New York Times article

1289
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,463
The New York Times article ended up putting

1290
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,047
Alex Jones in the hopper

1291
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
He needs funding

1292
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:39,423
Invest in him he is over a f****** Barrel

1293
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Wow

1294
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
God dammit

1295
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,543
War games

1296
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
Not what happened

1297
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
Russia Siberia

1298
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,503
Two things that we need to do right now

1299
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,087
We need to be on MSNBC as Alex Jones

1300
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,367
Expert on.

1301
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
We need to do

1302
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,231
Some serious Consulting for Russia

1303
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
On how they need

1304
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,327
Proceed with this this all out show situation

1305
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Scenario I just

1306
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,679
Slide-out is one possibility give you a second one

1307
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Alex the f******

1308
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:17,311
She's a horrible bigot

1309
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,871
And the people who work at accents

1310
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
Is there anyway we can

1311
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,015
. talk with this guy anymore

1312
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Breach of contract

1313
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Faucet

1314
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,183
Roll

1315
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Need to get letter

1316
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,815
If they're sending that if there's that letter the way it's

1317
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,631
Get a letter b a business

1318
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Sad roll

1319
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
Here's this this life

1320
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
F****** in tent sales

1321
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,895
Not normally what we see is him talk about something very serious

1322
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Hibbetts into a commercial

1323
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,711
In this case

1324
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
He's doing an ad

1325
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
Denison to Aiken

1326
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,087
Theory about what happened to Milo

1327
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
The night before

1328
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:09,535

1337
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,791

1340
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Rape

1341
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
It's assert with Bill Clinton raping a shirt on it

1342
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:00,223

Cargo van

1349
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:23,263
His whole campaign where he would tell he was telling people that if you got on the news

1350
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,567

1351
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615

And said infowars.com he would give you $5,000

1353
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,343

1354
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,559
Well I hope he's already paid

1355
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Those people out

1356
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,167
Looking up the Admiral situation

1357
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
None of

1358
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
What he is

1359
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Is on Admiral

1360
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,151
We talked about all of the stuff that they emailed him

1361
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,223
It is completely mentioned that terms of service

1362
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,015
Yeah none of that is on a draw

1363
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
So

1364
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
It is

1365
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
Is this

1366
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
Is this all a secret game

1367
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Game plan

1368
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
To sell more s***

1369
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,071
It could be

1370
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,655
It could be you could be having a fire sale

1371
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447

1378
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,039

Pyramid marketing

1383
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,567

But just to poke holes

1388
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,327
A tiny bit near theory that maybe

1389
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
This is all like a

1390
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Facade or fake

1391
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,191
Listen to listen to

1392
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
City of his

1393
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Sales pitch

1394
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:30,751
Shopping cart

1395
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,311
Would make America free again

1396
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
I come and take it

1397
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:43,295

1399
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
And

1400
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,151
All of these amazing

1401
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,455
Now we're good

1402
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:20,671
Organizations that are actually defending

1403
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
No Mel

1404
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,815
Conspiracy theories

1405
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,607
With Alex

1406
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,655
What's your theory on this way

1407
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:37,055
I have no theory on this I'm talking about how the last weekend or the last like 3 clips we end

1408
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:45,247
Immediately

1409
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:48,319
The invitation

1410
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,463
Yes

1411
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
That's what I

1412
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,535
Dammit I love this

1413
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
About to be fair

1414
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,119
Alex Jones is not a man who would

1415
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
Defense ePacket

1416
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
Any other

1417
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Right

1418
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,263
Establishment

1419
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
Thesaurus Republicans

1420
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
Or something like that

1421
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Alright

1422
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,223
They're the enemy as well

1423
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,623
Republican

1424
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
He's making them out to be villains

1425
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:30,047
Ray Milo just to uninvite him

1426
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,351
Discredit him as

1427
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,167
The opening Salvo in the takedown

1428
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,959
View right wing

1429
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
Wacky news

1430
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,055
Which he claimed is the takedown of civilization

1431
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,359
That's insane

1432
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,919
Yeah

1433
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
That's a long day is they were like

1434
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,855
Hottest s*** right now

1435
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,927
Milo's a pedophile right now are we blew it

1436
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,999
I can't imagine how she Bill Maher must

1437
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,535
30 maybe not at all he's

1438
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,631
Better ratings

1439
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Who gives a

1440
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,679
He doesn't give a f***

1441
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Probably disappointed

1442
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
He didn't have him on ask

1443
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,335
I know

1444
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,687
I nearly missed out on the best Cooper

1445
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,783
Can light and my ratings

1446
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,879
Everybody watch the ship

1447
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:31,999
I would have been a lie would have been unable to avoid clips of that show today

1448
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,815
Bill Maher

1449
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Opportunist

1450
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,471
It's like we all f****** knew he was from the very

1451
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,495
Beginning

1452
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,967
He Rambles a bit

1453
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
Actually sort of

1454
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,015
Admits that it's

1455
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,319
Cool if Russia infiltrates our government is

1456
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Is long

1457
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Just weird

1458
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
And then he gets into another impassion

1459
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,231
Sales pitch

1460
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Involves

1461
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,079
Of the committee

1462
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,359
Let's Be Santa

1463
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,199
Curt welder

1464
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,991
Head of the kid and he was not

1465
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,807
Is vice chair of something but again Alex doesn't

1466
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,623
He plays fast and loose with the detail

1467
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,463
But he knows all about China

1468
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Superman

1469
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,767
The only ways

1470
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
Get through this

1471
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:44,703
Of Homeland Security

1472
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:54,175
About the clintons and the Chinese

1473
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
Whoa whoa whoa

1474
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,047
Beautiful

1475
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
Here's the bottom line

1476
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:19,775
Did he just say it was fine if Russia infiltrated our government

1477
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
I think he just said it was fine of Russia infiltrated cuz we had Obama in there

1478
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:29,759
What's up basically

1479
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,879
He's cool with it isn't that bad

1480
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,719
But it's fine now because they respect Trump at the very least

1481
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:45,119
Supposed to pretend

1482
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,191
3.3 given up all the secrets

1483
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:52,287
NetSpend

1484
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,687
Is he going to give up all of those I think he's trying to entice

1485
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,735
The Russian investors that we were talking to

1486
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
We were speculating about earlier

1487
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,135
Of course they infiltrated the government totally fine

1488
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
He can say that it's cool that

1489
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
You can say it but I think

1490
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,495
Sing it will only make the case against much stronger

1491
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,055
Whenever people are alike

1492
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
Trump song

1493
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
We talked to him on the phone

1494
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
I think that basically means it

1495
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
Trump has told him

1496
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,783
Russians

1497
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,391
Or at the very least Trump has told him like

1498
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,951
Hey man I got all these Russian contracts

1499
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:46,303
What's the only ones left

1500
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
Also

1501
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Also

1502
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,631
If we take

1503
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,655
Blue lighter that he got

1504
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,935
From Admiral series

1505
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
Him saying that Trump is the most

1506
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,055
Beautiful pigheaded man he's ever seen

1507
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,127
This might be why you're in trouble

1508
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:07,039
The ballpark

1509
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,343
Kind of understand that but again

1510
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,183
He's a beautiful pigheaded man pigheaded man

1511
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
On the cops not a good

1512
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
If you said I was a beautiful pigheaded man

1513
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
I would not make me feel better

1514
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,375
In your character

1515
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,167
So I would never describe you that way

1516
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,239
You're an ugly pig headed back

1517
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,823
Target

1518
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
She's on fire

1519
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:44,159
He also was the guy who is behind the Swift boat Veterans for truth

1520
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
So

1521
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,815
F***

1522
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:01,055
New York Times best sellers

1523
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:07,455
Everything that's been a bestseller bestseller

1524
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,783
It doesn't matter if you get a disc

1525
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,063
Credited

1526
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:16,927
You just shown publicly definitively to be a liar and a propagandist

1527
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,487
I don't care about your accomplishments anymore

1528
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,815
But also like

1529
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,031

1530
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799

01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,943
Oh he's like why is he at his age

1532
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Play me so hard

1533
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,503
Another day shows that

1534
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,527
Screen Jerome corsi

1535
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,855
Please fat bloated f****** head

1536
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:53,279
But you want to talk talk

1537
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,423
What were the talk

1538
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
Why do you think it is

1539
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:08,639
The reasons because every other organization get work anywhere else

1540
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,199
Listen

1541
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
No one would touch him

1542
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:20,671
They complain about not getting White House credentials

1543
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
Another part of this

1544
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
Been up this

1545
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
Episode

1546
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:31,167
First of all that really talk a big game before they really they really were

1547
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
Episode

1548
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:33,983
You know they just

1549
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,383
They won't give me these credentials there's no reason

1550
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,967
To give them those potential reasons not to give you those credentials

1551
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
Anyway

1552
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,599
Some I would love to

1553
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,391
To see some Alex Jones questions

1554
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,927
In the Press Corps

1555
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,719
Just laugh

1556
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
Excuse Me Miss

1557
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Trump

1558
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,887
What are you doing

1559
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
That's way too tight

1560
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,431
Have you considered trying wearing a

1561
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Bill

1562
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:21,599
Would you also missed suv-like

1563
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
Direct I missed out

1564
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,511
I also think he never lets Jerome talk about Quest

1565
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,559
Because he realizes folks

1566
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,263
Not anymore

1567
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:49,247
Cuz your life depends on it

1568
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,791
The money

1569
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:18,432
Started

1570
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,528
We're going

1571
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,576
Pledge before God

1572
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,440
That I am going to turn

1573
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
Completely over this

1574
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,912
Discernment

1575
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:52,480
Bill about the bills

1576
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,440
Money

1577
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
Pathetic

1578
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Really

1579
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,096
There are no more conspiracy theories about that

1580
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:16,544
He wrote the letter because the actual email was like

1581
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
Dude f*** off

1582
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,128
Know the actual email probably had details he couldn't

1583
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Refute

1584
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,224
Good point

1585
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
He wrote that email

1586
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,296
Also

1587
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:32,672
Already but I believe that email

1588
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,256
The sign-off is just a first name

1589
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,120
Adroll

1590
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
Caroline

1591
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,704
Love and

1592
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,056
There's no way that song by Caroline Amy business

1593
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,640
Anybody who's in customer relations or anything like that

1594
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408

1595
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:59,296
Email signature they have like a very least they would have a

1596
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,648
Phone number boilerplate magazine

1597
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
You're right

1598
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,464
This is not fake he is locked up

1599
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,048

1602
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,424
Stop doing the show

1603
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,960
But we are going to

1604
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,288
To see a skeleton crew of a man with an iPhone

1605
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,312
Filming him

1606
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
Dial

1607
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Excited get there

1608
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Play one Theory

1609
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,456
And that is

1610
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
A bunch of Rubes

1611
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:35,648
So I think he's going to make a ton of money off those

1612
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,232
The people who refuse to Baker

1613
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,560
Cake of a quart

1614
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:46,656
Yeah or Chick-fil-A to work that way

1615
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,216
I think he realizes he has enough bucking idiots

1616
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
It is called

1617
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520

01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:13,280
Into a 13-hour

1624
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:18,912

This isn't playing

1629
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,112
This is insane so anyway he's not

1630
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Seemed to know that he

1631
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,904
He's making an extra

1632
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
23.3 million dollars

1633
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,280
You can continue to operate at all

1634
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
After losing 3.5 billion dollar

1635
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,144

Fighting for his life

1643
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,328
The last hour from here on out

1644
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,144

Nobody pays rap

1649
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,312
For now

1650
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,408
And don't put them on the court

1651
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,088
Except for him as long as

1652
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,416
Dark core of a clip of this either

01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,696
Young woman's bedroom

1654
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,000
Alex was yelling about how

1655
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:53,120
I was going to add 25 more people around here

1656

You just music I believe in God and Providence

1658
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,200
That argument makes me think that there is a sea

1659
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,272
Okay like view confident

1660
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,576
Hire more people in a downturn

Email this morning

1670
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:16,576
Expenses on your website should be relevant decide

1671
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,512
They just planes

1672
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
I'm worthless

1673
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,168
Their businesses are you

1674
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,984
Besides

1675
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:39,616
We're just loved everywhere the president

1676
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:45,760
President called president the thing that's the problem

1677
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
If that letter

1678
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
No I think

1679
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
That was the problem

1680
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,136
Is that they wanted

1681
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,440
Easily verifiable claims

1682
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
And he has

1683
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,256
0 verifiable

1684
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:01,120
Listen to the episodes that we've done already we have verifiable

1685
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Evidence

1686
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,168
But he's a liar

1687
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,960
And consistently lies

1688
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:09,312
Everything is a lie even if you even if he was

1689
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,336
Trump campaign

1690
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,384

1691
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,944
Referencing

1692
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,736
I think they would have been fine with

1693
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,648
News is f****** Trump campaign October because of that sentence

1694
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,464
Implies affiliation

1695
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
Important

1696
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,048
And he never reads that from that letter

1697
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,888
Fox News as much as they are like a propaganda wing

1698
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,936
They don't pretend that there

1699
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
Friends with the

1700
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
Army they have

1701
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
They have

1702
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
What's

1703
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,896
What's the score

1704
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,688
Yeah but he still doesn't

1705
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,016
Talk all the time on his show about how he calls Trump

1706
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,296
It like that

1707
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,600
Alex Jones is cross the line

1708
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
In terms of what he's presenting

1709
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Also like

1710
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Trump calls

1711
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
No time

1712
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,864
Seems like Trump calls him often enough

1713
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:08,192
Yeah they probably talked a little bit but

1714
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Probably

1715
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,800
Yeah

1716
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
And he's like

1717
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,200
Do you have any listeners who are willing to

1718
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,784
Call me at 2 in the morning you got Nugent's phone number

1719
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,184
Ivan wants to meet Nugent all the time interview that they kept talking about

1720
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
Galaxy

1721
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:34,304
Rebel rock and roll

1722
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:39,424
Nobody more rebellious than 85 year old Ted

1723
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,800
F****** Nugent weird f****** grey soul patch

1724
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,592
It's always a good time

1725
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
President

1726
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:54,016
Journalist on

1727
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:58,112
What awards New York Times bestseller Jerome corsi

1728
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:03,232
Yes but he has a numerical response

1729
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
Nobody's giving him up bathtub

1730
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,888
Sean

1731
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,704
Conspicuous

1732
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,496
Guess that he's listening is

1733
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:18,848
Notorious social justice Warrior rainbow snatch

1734
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
Although

1735
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,664
I would give her a comedy

1736
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,232
Rice's it

1737
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,768
I don't think they're unconnected

1738
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,680
If I roll a troll song

1739
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,472
That is God is real

1740
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,520
The way that Alex Jones

1741
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:52,128
This is punishment for that rainbow science just for how bad a comedy

1742
01:29:54,944 --> 01:30:01,088
What the hell are you talkin about we're changing the world we just put the

1743
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,928
The other big news

1744
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,000
Are contracted and viewership

1745
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
I love them

1746
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,072
They're all in trouble

1747
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:18,240
Except for us

1748
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,528
Switch worship

1749
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
We just got hit by

1750
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,232
We're going to

1751
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,328
But I don't want to spend all my time crawling around just trying to raise capital

1752
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:48,960
We need everybody to get products.com

1753
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,712
Do you want to hear this

1754
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:06,880
That's where this country is

1755
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:13,536
Silver

1756
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:18,912
He doesn't talk to Jerome corsi just talked about colloidal silver for like 5 minutes

1757
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,448
By the way Breitbart has an

1758
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
Yeah they do

1759
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,496
Yasso doesn't forward

1760
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:30,432
Nope it's all bulshit

1761
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,016
You just go and find

1762
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,856
You can't Google search

1763
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,880
Yes you can

1764
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
You can do that

1765
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,816
Cuz you're lying

1766
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,168
Are they merging with

1767
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,704
I think it's probably

1768
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
I can't be Breitbart

1769
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Because

1770
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,800
That would have weird console

1771
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
The

1772
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,384
I think it has to be

1773
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
Garage

1774
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
You think so I think so

1775
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,736
Okay so but Drudge

1776
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,272
You just an aggregator right

1777
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,808
Mostly

1778
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
Summer Ridge

1779
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,648
Metal content on there but it is largely posting link

1780
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,696
To Infowars

1781
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,720
Almost

1782
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,512
The other so there's almost done

1783
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,304
One other thing

1784
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,096
Breitbart was taken off at

1785
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,144
No no that was supposed

1786
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,216
So he mentioned a couple names

1787
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:28,032
He said Admiral was coming after us

1788
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
One other

1789
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,944
Audience

1790
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Contracted

1791
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
And he knows that

1792
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,760
Wrightwood which is

1793
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,552
The opposite of the narrative that he likes

1794
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,368
Suspend but it's also because there's so much fake

1795
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
Check

1796
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,976
Lakeview can have millions of hits to your website a day

1797
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,304
But if you look at the actual analytics of it you look at unique

1798
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,352
Viewers on a it's totally different

1799
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,400
Really like if you go to his

1800
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
Did you go to the Quan

1801
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,752
Cast and you look at the numbers versus younique

1802
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
Visitors

1803
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
And it's true

1804
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,944
1/3 was fake right most Twitter followers

1805
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,248
Between 20% in the third

1806
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,320
Yeah remember the exact number but it's in there

1807
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
Between

1808
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,160
Because I don't remember which was prisonplanet and which was

1809
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:16,928
Alex Jones

1810
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,536
Wow that's just Twitter

1811
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,352
If you go to actual website

1812
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,400
Set up

1813
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,168
Artifact

1814
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
Play traffic

1815
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,264
No doubt in my mind

1816
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Wing sites are doing

1817
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,384
Of course

1818
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920
But that's a whole nother

1819
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
Dilemma for another day

1820
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
Because

1821
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,064
Because there is no there is no right way

1822
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
There's Trump winning

1823
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
And then there's

1824
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
Reality

1825
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:52,000
So there's Democrats who are

1826
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,608
He has an interview on this show with a guy

1827
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,632
Who claims

1828
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,424
To be one of the most important

1829
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,984
Intelligence operators in the world

1830
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:08,640
His name is Robert Steele interview

1831
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,920
Do

1832
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:19,392
Rob's Mila's better

1833
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,840
He's a weird dude and his interview is scary as hell but before we get to that I want to take a little opportunity

1834
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,912
To introduce you to another gentleman who was a member of Alex Jones

1835
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,984
Okay the name of Mark Dice

1836
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,544
Pastel snow

1837
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:42,432
Mark Dice

1838
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
More less

1839
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,760
Yeah I think it's time that we meet him

1840
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:52,672
Is a clip this is a show right now

1841
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
He

1842
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,744
Is insane

1843
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
Hey if you're adding

1844
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,608
If you're if you're there now

1845
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:04,704
With what we if you specifically single him out for being

1846
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,776
Now I want

1847
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,336
They take at least five minutes

1848
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,920
To play a Mark Dice segment in the middle of this week

1849
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,016
Yes but also I didn't look at

1850
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,832
Intuit and marked iceworks rain for Wars a ways back

1851
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:27,488
And Alex Jones had a falling-out own YouTube channel

1852
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,024
He was mocking Alex Jones

1853
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,376
Consistently starting are we watching

1854
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:38,240
Special wrestling reconciliation this is Kevin Owens

1855
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:42,592
Is Sami Zayn coming back together

1856
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
Play Squash the beef

1857
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:48,480
And now they're working together again

1858
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,504
More or less

1859
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,576
Does a couple of things you sometimes does really snarky report

1860
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
Football a lot of what he does

1861
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
Is jaywalk

1862
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,744
He does a lot of like the man on the street

1863
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,888
The lookout and the implied thing is that they're all liberal

1864
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
Stupid Liberals are

1865
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:11,264
I'm going to play I hate it whenever we are so f******

1866
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,592
Little sample of

1867
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
I'm out on the street

1868
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:20,224
If you're watching the video

1869
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,552
Get to are all trying to walk away

1870
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:32,000
Born and which which means ours which means that not all Liberals are dumb

1871
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:38,400
What country is Mount Rushmore located in

1872
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:44,800
I'm going to have to revoke your citizenship

1873
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:51,200
Located I don't know you don't know

1874
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:57,600
I don't know where you live I have no idea

1875
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
So

1876
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Could tell.

1877
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
Something about your toy

1878
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
That is

1879
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,240
Dear God

1880
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,032
B Barker

1881
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,640
It's just asking people questions you were walking around them

1882
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:23,968
But one of his big gotcha journalism

1883
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,736
Homestyle

1884
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,272
It's he'll pretend

1885
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,832
Something really bad

1886
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,392
You're so gullible you believe

1887
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
I took this

1888
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,744
Was in talking to a girl that that

1889
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,816
Signed an executive order to get rid of tampons

1890
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,584
Chestnut

1891
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
Gullibility

1892
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,912
No that's the world we live in

1893
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
There are

1894
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:49,568
0 things you can tell me about Trump be like entertain the possibility

1895
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,640
But you told this girl that Trump is trying to outlaw

1896
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,664
Now

1897
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
Keep playing this in his

1898
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,736
Sizzle reel

1899
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,272
Stupid people

1900
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,808
Response

1901
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:32,576
What's being made fun of their response

1902
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,368
Put that

1903
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
Really

1904
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,536
Grateful

1905
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
Maybe Schnucks

1906
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
Clippers

1907
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
Because

1908
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,400
He agrees with

1909
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
Maybe he never wanted to

1910
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:54,080
Maybe that you never stop wanting to take Alex Jones

1911
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:56,384
Conspiracy theorist on this bucket

1912
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:06,112
Jordan the worm has turned

1913
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
And weird

1914
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,744
This is all gone.

1915
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Yeah

1916
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,776
Really great.

1917
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,592
So how bad of like man-on-the-street

1918
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,640
There's no punch

1919
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
There's no like

1920
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,200
You're an idiot

1921
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:36,064
It was just keep introduced the idea that Trump was going to be

1922
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:42,464
Preposterous I don't really believe but I will say that it's not luxurious to have your. I've had my

1923
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
. for a really long time

1924
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:48,352
Question of like where does Trump live it was asked

1925
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,704
So far Trump seems to have

1926
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,240
Many different living location

1927
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,312
Seems like even though he's supposed to live in the White House

1928
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,848
Rarely there

1929
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,152
Also maybe he lives in New York

1930
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,944
Was he born in New York

1931
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:09,344
Probably but I don't know he spends a lot of time in marahlago

1932
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Exactly

1933
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:14,976
Somebody

1934
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,256
What country

1935
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,048
Mount Rushmore in

1936
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
America

1937
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,216
What country is North Dakota

1938
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,776
Boron

1939
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Highest ship

1940
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,336
Camelbeach

1941
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,896
Market coming up with your camera then

1942
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,688
S*** blowing The Buzz

1943
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:41,088
Trump kids are big Hunters they go on hunting trips just for fun in

1944
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:47,488
Just getting people's reactions to Donald Trump's kids

1945
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:53,888
Now killing the Triceratops toy in Africa

1946
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,176
So you meet me in the corner

1947
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,712
So again even though he's

1948
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,992
He said Triceratops

1949
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,016
She had the

1950
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,040
Absolute correct

1951
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:15,648
You kill a lot of wild game weirdly

1952
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,744
Like if I was asked that question

1953
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
I would immediately

1954
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
We stop and go

1955
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,352
Ceratops aren't real

1956
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,776
To the bigger issue I would say that you are clearly make

1957
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,080
Exaggeration and I'm going to give you a response

1958
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
Instead of engaging with your dumbass

1959
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,688
Cheese

1960
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,712
Clearly

1961
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Like a wannabe actor

1962
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,880
She's like grabbing the mic from him and stuff like that just dumb and going along with it for like

1963
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,904
Being on camera

1964
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,184
What is fine

1965
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,048
It doesn't end up being funny at all

1966
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,352
All it is is you don't know Triceratops

1967
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,888
Fart real

1968
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,448
What one I mean Triceratops are

1969
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
Are real

1970
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,752
Not today

1971
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Okay that's good

1972
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:08,640
What's next

1973
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,920
I don't think

1974
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
It's true but to

1975
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:17,344
Now this next clip is the beginning of this interview with Rob Steele

1976
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,696
It isn't really short clip where Alex makes

1977
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,536
Committed burglary Italy

1978
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
Determinism

1979
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:31,424
The right probably has robbed or stolen

1980
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Something

1981
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:39,616
How did you not think of that that's the only thing I've been thinking about every time you said his name because his name

1982
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
Ste

1983
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,664
Ele

1984
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,200
Steel

1985
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:45,248
Rob steal to me is more like

1986
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,576
Superhero alter-ego

1987
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Steel Man

1988
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
Yeah

1989
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,440
So this clip is really short and Alex makes

1990
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,256
Wild exaggeration about the situation

1991
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:11,360
And what current this is the most serious censorship

1992
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,176
Since the Civil War in this country

1993
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Old

1994
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,296
Okay

1995
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,320
Alright

1996
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,344
Alright

1997
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,136
I'm going to try and argue with it

1998
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:25,440
The most serious censorship

1999
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,720
Civil War in this

2000
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
This country

2001
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:31,584
The most serious censorship

2002
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,608
2 Live Crew

2003
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:37,984
Milli Vanilli not being allowed to have a career

2004
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,008
Girl you know it

2005
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:39,776
Girl

2006
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
You know it's true

2007
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:48,480
Whatever FDR refuse to mention that it was

2008
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
Typically the Jap

2009
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,272
Bunnies that he's putting in

2010
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,856
The order that he wrote

2011
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Never once

2012
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:55,904
Mentioned

2013
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,184
Japanese

2014
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:59,744
Selective

2015
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,792
Not censorship

2016
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:08,192
That's a good point being forced upon somebody to Live Crew

2017
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Group

2018
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,752
They got banned

2019
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
That's great song

2020
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:23,552
His balls to his leg

2021
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,672
Although at the same time

2022
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:33,280
Wasn't he already in trouble enough

2023
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,584
PCP on video and selling it

2024
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:39,680
My buddy

2025
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,752
Me and my buddies actually bought that.

2026
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
View from the

2027
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
Like a late-night in

2028
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,104
It's called PCP saved my life

2029
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
It was

2030
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,808
This is just

2031
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,368
This Robert Steele talking

2032
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:00,672
Clue dinner

2033
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,696
Reviews on the show

2034
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,464
Right but

2035
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,816
This guy is not being allowed to see

2036
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,608
Photos of a guy saying isn't

2037
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Incredibly scary

2038
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,192
But I think it's actually really what this is all about

2039
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:17,056
Hey you're my hero I think you're one of the best

2040
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,112
Daniel Sheehan

2041
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,096
Jaded

2042
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:51,872
Alex their own whenever they have not yet authorized any

2043
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
Actual

2044
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,712
We still fought a lot of wars

2045
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
No I agree

2046
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,064
Problem

2047
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:00,832
Jones

2048
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,624
Losing a sponsor

2049
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,904
Is not the biggest

2050
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,952
Threat to democracy sent that

2051
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,512
I would say

2052
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
No

2053
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Question

2054
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Thrill

2055
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,544
If you

2056
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:41,024
Lawyers

2057
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:44,352
Is the lawyer

2058
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:50,240
I reviewed his book

2059
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,824
To get to lawyer

2060
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,664
The greatest lawyers on the planet but one of them

2061
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,224
Defended the guy

2062
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
Papers

2063
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,576
Yeah

2064
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
So you got that guy

2065
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,672
Who defended

2066
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
Let's go.

2067
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,352
That's like

2068
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,120
That's like

2069
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:19,424
The guy who

2070
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,984
And the guy who defended from it

2071
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:29,152
Character

2072
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:33,504
Whatever it was the Bob punching dummy

2073
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:40,416
Okay we don't have time for it now but I just want you to know

2074
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,560
This is not an Alex Jones take out

2075
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
I came up with a segment

2076
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:52,448
Next episode

2077
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,984

2081
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,792

2089
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:43,904
December 7th 2016 article from Fortune Magazine

Victory

2091
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:51,072
Patient employees Fortune has learned

2092
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
CEO Erin Bell provided

2093
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:59,776
Decisions to focus on the growth areas that were most excited about

2094
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,432
And there was no personal impact

2095
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,480
We saw a record-breaking Revenue in 26

2096
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
These changes will

2097
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
Growth plans

2098
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,064

Ambien

2100
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,880
That 500 number come from

2101
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:16,416
A little bit later in the article

2102
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:20,256
Around 500 employees

2103
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,680
Their entire business

2104
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:31,520
He's one of the most important intelligence operatives in the world

2105
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,824
Steven Reed

2106
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,640
Paragraph article

2107
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
F******

2108
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,688
Liar

2109
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:41,760
Whatever they're complaining this is why

2110
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,808
This is why

2111
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:46,112
You flash that article on the

2112
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:52,512
How long did they leave the article did they leave it up long enough for you to read

2113
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
Basically admitting that

2114
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,192
My viewership

2115
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:04,544
Do not think someone

2116
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,568
I am

2117
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,592

01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Okay

2119
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,176
Maybe we're the only people saying

2120
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,272
McGinnis

2121
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:17,856
No we've already speculated that it's just Bob

2122
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,904
No one else

2123
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,792
There is there are zero Alex Jones listeners and yet somehow we have

2124
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
Song download

2125
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:32,192

Cling to him using him as Source material

2129
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:45,760
We just have a live video feed from a dude in a n insane

2130
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,832
That is what Alex lives in his head

2131
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,600
Anyway

2132
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,136
Get to what I

2133
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,672
I think this clip is really

2134
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
We need to

01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,456
Facebook Twitter and YouTube

2136
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,760
A good start

2137
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:24,160
I personally have never taken a pass on my website

2138
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,744
Swore

When you come home

2141
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:58,976
F******

2142
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,280
When you're complaining about censorship

2143
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,120
Channel

2144
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,680
I'm destroying the internet

2145
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:12,288
Solid Ground Electric

2146
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,056
Formed

2147
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
Yeah because that

2148
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:16,384

You know you know how much

2150
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,272
Mugabe ran a dictator

2151
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,184
97% of the votes

2152
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,976
Dictators win 97

2153
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
Great f****** great

2154
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,376
I love it

2155
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,400
The truth

2156
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,424
Channel

2157
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,472
Do you think

2158
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,264
So the theory behind

2159
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,800
Trump's Act

2160
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:47,872
Was that what he was really going for

2161
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,640
Was a

2162
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,408
Trump news

2163
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,992
That Jared Kushner with run

2164
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,296
You think they're still trying

2165
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:59,392
To put that together New York Post

2166
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,440
He's a real

2167
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,048
The paper

2168
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,912
I believe I read that somewhere

2169
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:16,544
I'm not claiming that

2170
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,640
Which

2171
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,200
If he was going

2172
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
Merge with

2173
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
Somebody

2174
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,296
Wouldn't you want him

2175
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,832
Find out whether or not

2176
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:31,904
Is it

2177
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,952
Is it actually this is actually

2178
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,720
Ability right

2179
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:37,280
Yeah it is a possibility

2180
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,560
State-run media

2181
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,584
And if we have

2182
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,864
State-run media

2183
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:49,568
It's not what happens like that's Prevail Brazil has Crohn's the New York

2184
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,336
Observer

2185
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:53,920
Is that a like a

2186
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:54,944
Like

2187
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,504
I don't know it

2188
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,600
It might be I don't know what the New York

2189
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,880
Observers I don't know if it's

2190
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,160
Paper of record

2191
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:07,232
Incredible

2192
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,280
S***

2193
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,328
Just make up out of whole cloth video and sound

2194
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,120
I apologize that I said

2195
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:15,168
But it still happening

2196
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:20,032
The idea that he's going to merge with some other propagandist arm and create

2197
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:26,176
About earlier the episode is one of the serious possibility

2198
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,456
For real

2199
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:29,504
Wow

01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,904
That's Russia for all my goodies

01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,192
Free Rodger Stone

2208
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496

Being in panic mode

2220
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,224
It's so fun and I don't think

Is this

2234
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,096
This state-run media s***

2235
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,120
You still up

2236
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
And we

2237
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
Or on the ground

2238
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,216
Floor

2239
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,496
Against it

2240
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:31,360
Weird hipsters against a run

2241
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:34,944
The most out of it

2242
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,480
You're naked self-interest

2243
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,760
Is

2244
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:39,040
Not naked self-interest

2245
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,856
I don't need game monetarily or anything like that

2246
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,416
What is now important

2247
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
Yeah weird

2248
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:48,000
Weird

2249
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,096
Being important is the worst thing I can think about

2250
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:56,448
It's a little scary this is so fun

2251
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,496
So

2252
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:02,080
Like it's. Severe released

2253
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,152
Hundreds of people were listening

2254
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,688
Like it did everyone loves

2255
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,736
Appreciate

2256
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:09,760
Do you listen very much

2257
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,344
Debunking these lies are so easy

2258
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,648
A hot knife through butter

2259
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:19,488
We

2260
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:26,400
God I wish just gave us

2261
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
I think

2262
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,008
That we are in for an

2263
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:39,456
Uno's 6 months from now

2264
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:43,296
Let's not go crazy

2265
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:49,696
Maybe the only way to keep this going is to escape

2266
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,864
We're going to go from being knowledge fight to Trump

2267
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
News fight

2268
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,400
Yeah

2269
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,424
And also

2270
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,960
Remember

2271
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,984
I like episode

2272
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:04,288
Three-year whatever I was speculating that

2273
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,824
This could become dangerous

2274
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
Yeah

2275
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,384
This could become

2276
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,968
I thought we were all having a nice little laugh

2277
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,504
Not anymore

2278
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,528
This could

2279
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,552
Like

2280
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:19,904
You know what happens to people that does sound very megalomaniacal

2281
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:24,768
Now do what we're doing in Russia

2282
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:28,096
Yeah oh my God if we

2283
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,120
Look

2284
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,936
Do you remember the journalist

2285
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,752
Ate her home

2286
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
In the face like

2287
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,080
20 time on Putin's birthday

2288
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,616
Birthday witch

2289
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:40,640
Both

2290
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
Like if it was

2291
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:42,688
Real

2292
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:50,112
TV show part of you realize that's wagon dick

2293
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:53,184
Let's

2294
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,208
Book The Wire

2295
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,256
Like them

2296
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:02,144
We might be in your f******

2297
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,448
And shot today

2298
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:09,824
The only way I want to die for sure

2299
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,360
Just bring this back into reality

2300
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
Yes

2301
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,432
This hasn't happened yet

2302
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,712
The state-run media thing

2303
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:16,736
There's just

2304
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:19,040
In this episode

2305
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:24,160
We're not really in danger we're not we're not paranoid to the point where it's like

2306
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:29,536
We think this is real no matter how many conspiracy theories we just made up in the past hour

2307
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:33,376
We are not paranoid worst case scenario

2308
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,144
Getting really dark

2309
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:38,496
We will commence again

2310
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,288
Best case scenario is that this

2311
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,056
Get dark

2312
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,080
For whom

2313
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:43,616
Dark that's fine

2314
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:47,712
Anyway this last clip I want to play is more from the Robert

2315
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,480
Steel

2316
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,760
Interview

2317
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,784
Where Alex

2318
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,576
Trying to get

2319
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:55,136
Robert Steele to talk about how

2320
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:58,976
Shity Alex's situation is

2321
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:04,608
All you want to talk about

2322
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:05,888
What's wrong man

2323
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:12,544
Alex wants to do is talk about like I lost 3.3 million dollars everyone's trying to censor me

2324
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,080
And Roberts

2325
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,104
Steel is like

2326
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:15,872
He will not

2327
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:16,640
Stop

2328
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408
Cheating

2329
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,944
You need to get lawyers

2330
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
In-N-Out

2331
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,248
Alex Jones is

2332
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
Defense

2333
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:24,320
If I just lost 3.3 million dollars

2334
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:29,696
Holy s*** that's all I would be able to talk about

2335
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,512
Taking the day off

2336
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,792
That's a good point

2337
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,144
F****** wasted right

2338
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,704
This dude

2339
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,520
He is sucking wasted right now

2340
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,800
You should replace it about

2341
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,080
10 in the morning

2342
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:48,128
Still just keep telling him to lawyer up

2343
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,664
Lawyer up

2344
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,712
Dafuq intake

2345
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:52,480
The fight

2346
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,320
Google

2347
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
I guess

2348
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,648
If you're going to win a fight

2349
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,416
Against

2350
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,976
But that's that's another thing if he does

2351
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:05,024
End up taking the skies advice

2352
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,072
She's going to get why

2353
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:10,912
Frankly if he fights against Google I wouldn't be surprised if

2354
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:14,752
He died on Google

2355
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:22,688
GE doesn't exactly what the

2356
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:23,968
This f*****-up about this clip

2357
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:24,736
But it's f***** up

2358
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:28,832
You are our natural leader

2359
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
Wolf

2360
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:47,776
Lawyers

2361
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,736
Washington Post list they admit was a fake list

2362
02:01:58,016 --> 02:02:02,112
You signed a contract worked with you for years and now we're not going to work with you

2363
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:06,464
They said know you're fake you're a fraud

2364
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:08,768
You are a propaganda

2365
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,072
I wouldn't say it you

2366
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,424
No nevermind

2367
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,920
Speak out

2368
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:30,784
Gloves off

2369
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,112
That's not.

2370
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:36,160
Oh my God

2371
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,976
It's also not there is a trump News Network

2372
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:45,632
Alex Jones will win all of the ports prices

2373
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,912
Because you know

2374
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:54,336
I listen to I listen to the Past episode does like

2375
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:58,944
That's both just left

2376
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:02,784
Just

2377
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,320
Having a guy on

2378
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,344
By the way

2379
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,392
We all know how hard it is

2380
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,416
To get voted out

2381
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,256
To do that

2382
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
Not great

2383
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:15,328
Is Rob

2384
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:17,120
Still currently

2385
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,400
Sucking Alex Jones

2386
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,288
Do you like Alex Jones

2387
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:28,384
Bingo there are natural

2388
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,712
The guy on Skype

2389
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:38,112
Sitting with Jerome corsi in an office telling you that the Chinese are involved with Hillary Clinton which is something you said

2390
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:42,976
100 x on your own show already

2391
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:45,536
But given no evidence that actually happened

2392
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:47,840
That's not surprised

2393
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:48,608
Journalism

2394
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,936
And I know

2395
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:59,104
He's never going to get to the details

2396
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,176
This guy came on my show and said his family was threatened

2397
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,456
As that becomes

2398
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,504
Enough for the story to be real

2399
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,088
Was that guy's family threatened with polonium poisoning

2400
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:11,648
Like Rogers

2401
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:16,512
It's everywhere it's all around us polonium

2402
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:22,656
I don't even know if I'm not poison with it right now I know you might just be sleepy or

2403
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:32,128
Right where you're right where Wikileaks was

2404
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:40,320
Which is not a thing they have to have

2405
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,856
Freeport

2406
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,720
Free Waze app

2407
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,656
Symptom of steroid

2408
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:57,728
And you make these purple people

2409
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,520
O.j. Simpson

2410
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:04,128
Let's stay right where we are

2411
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,432
O.j. Simpson murdered two people

2412
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,992
Lawyers to cover it up

2413
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,784
So don't use that metaphor

2414
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:16,160
When Legend Lee murdered

2415
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,208
It was not

2416
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,280
But anyway

2417
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:27,168
I wish I was all the sudden everybody found out that I'm an OJ apologist or something

2418
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:33,056
Your Holocaust denier

2419
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,080
Cuz you're pigheaded

2420
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:35,104
I am I'm a

2421
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,640
Beautifully picnic

2422
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:41,760
No don't like the dream team's you want to say that

2423
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,648
Girl

2424
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,928
Better Dream Team

2425
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,488
I really hope he was on the Dream Team

2426
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:53,536
I forgot tonight for lineup

2427
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:12,736
Me in front of Donald Trump and Steve

2428
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,976
Is that how we got the record

2429
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,424
Because I've got to suggest this electoral format

2430
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:33,472
Well if

2431
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,264
I will I mean

2432
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Would total

2433
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
Totally

2434
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:43,200
Aruba

2435
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:46,528
Little bit of a

2436
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,296
Is playing Alec

2437
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,368
Because

2438
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:54,464
The whole thing where you were like

2439
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,024
Because you trying to

2440
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:00,864
How many dicks

2441
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,912
Do you have to suck to get to Trump

2442
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:05,728
My favorite

2443
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:11,616
Stucker commercial degrees of Kevin Bacon

2444
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Trump

2445
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,064
I think this guy does actually think that there should be a trump

2446
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:20,832
Channel

2447
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:24,160
But I also think

2448
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,184
He has no

2449
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
The Alex Jones

2450
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:30,816
Which

2451
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,632
Is a great idea if you're him

2452
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:37,216
It's not a bad idea.

2453
