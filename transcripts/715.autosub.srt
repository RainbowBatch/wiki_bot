1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Worship at the altar of Celine talk a little bit about

7
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:11,168
Alex Jones

8
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,520
My bright spots baby Jordan we are recording this

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Late

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
To do to some logistic and so I can play with my brights body is just

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,064
Got done recording the majority report I guess it was recorded

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,368
But yeah it's so I didn't get a chance

13
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
It's to say some gushy things that I invited

14
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
But

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
The that show was very

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Important

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
I think early on during that do this a lot of people ask me like how do you stay sane right listening to all this

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Alexander was really critical for me was

19
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
There is a groundedness to reality and a lot of the interviews that's a man

20
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
Do

21
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
With people surrounding like

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
Political things and policy issues

23
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,392
And I found that to be very comforting and anyway that like

24
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
I don't know my parents listening

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,512
Dude watching like the MacNeil Lehrer our was a kid

26
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Well it's granular

27
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,888
Yes that's what you're you like that's ran you in its real yes

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,728
Talking about real stuff is right next to it so much of what Infowars is

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,056
MMD entertainment value of just like

30
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
Sam and Andy Kindler

31
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,456
Breaking down Dennis Miller s*** doesn't get better than that and so

32
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,808
You know that when we started the show that was something that was really helpful in terms of keeping me

33
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
On the level

34
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
And the notion of being able to be on the show and

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,208
And

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Just crazy

37
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
I think that this sneak week has been really bizarre

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
And no disrespect to cnnr Brian stelter but like

39
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Doesn't compare

40
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,360
Being on being on the same and they're the majority report

41
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Something

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm not.

43
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Who is Steve but you know it's something I'm

44
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
It's big

45
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
What's a red spot spot is first off

46
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Obviously that too

47
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
B i s

48
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
My mother's in-law

49
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Anarchy

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,520
Nice things about him all the time and never enough never enough

51
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,896
No they invited their daughter to go to Ireland with him and then I married her so they have

52
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
To take me now too so

53
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
I am going to Ireland tomorrow

54
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
Yeah yeah

55
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
New Order the Lucky Charms there is like it taste better

56
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
The lot like in Paris

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,888
The Lucky Charms in Ireland you just don't get them anywhere else I was trying to think

58
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,240
Think of something that I would like you to bring me back and

59
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
I don't know that I just think of like

60
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
Maurice's

61
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
That has like the peat moss

62
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Be worth it illegal for me to bring that back to claret

63
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
Village of Enon things to declare I don't drink that much these days so I can't answer whiskey with no

64
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
Not really not not nothing

65
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
I'll come up with something I'll text you I'll come up with something and then I'll text you

66
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079
Something probably very thoughtful I hope you have a great trip

67
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
And

68
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,247
That leads us to I haven't really fully decided exactly how we're going to play it yet exactly

69
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
You're going to be gone next week

70
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Ansel

71
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
Our ability to record any episodes

72
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Is it going to be

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,695
Gone basically reduced

74
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
2

75
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,607
Right if there's a giant emergency we could like Skype in the middle.

76
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:58,751
That is a possibility and I don't like taking time off so there's a decent chance I'll come up with something to

77
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
To do brats

78
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
Temper your expectations

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
There may be a creeping away week

80
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
He'd at least

81
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Some breaking the only way to in

82
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Force that

83
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Is to leave the country

84
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Doesn't work

85
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,375
There may be one episode next week there might actually be non

86
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,447
But we're not entirely sure we will

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
We will see what happens

88
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:33,311
I mean there's no way that we

89
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Put out you know like

90
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:40,223
12 hours of content in the past seven people need time to catch up on

91
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Emu picture

92
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575

00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
You make it a practice

141
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
When they are

142
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311

00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Fox to the announcement

147
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
How the compensatory damages which ended up being a little over 4 million dollar

148
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,143
That took us to Thursday afternoon and the next day the trial entered the punitive

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Before we enter the week

00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
And track the response as the reality

152
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
The punitive damages sets in

153
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
NES to wrestle with a very large weight that he is now carrying

154
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Both in terms of financial consequences as well as the potential Fallout from his texts being accidentally turned over

155
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Do opposing counsel and what they could

156
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Good meaning for

157
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
His future

00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023

00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:43,423
If you're approaching me from those would like a reality yeah but if you're approaching it from Alex land

161
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Here is how we start the show

162
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263

Rochelle's in

166
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,463
One of the things you've been talking about on your show is your allegation

00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
Official

00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Your allegation

00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
That government official

172
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
That you're dumb

173
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
Eating and pedophilia

174
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
Child trafficking

175
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Wait we're doing it twice

176
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751

Love the great me makers out there great job love you all

178
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
So this was his cut to make it seem like Alex's dropping a truth bomb on the court but if you listen to the larger

179
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Clipper really just marks

180
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Response

181
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207

182
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Is your ally

183
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
R18

184
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Pedophilia

185
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Soundtrack

186
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Roomieofficial

187
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Alex brought up Epstein mic drop moment and honestly it wasn't even meaningful in the context of the quest

188
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Mark just says yeah sure

189
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,279
That was a question about Alex making accusations about the judge in this case being involved in pedophilia and child

190
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
Again which is conveniently not included in the meme that Alex is playing

191
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Because it wouldn't

192
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
Support the fun truth-telling thing that they were hoping to

193
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
To convey with a meme

194
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,591
In the real world this question was part of a setup for a trap that Alex walked himself into

195
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Peach him as a credible Witness

196
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Listen to trial

197
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
I went to the paint

198
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,759
Complete unserious person and this should be a great example of that

199
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,623
What do you said isn't threatening to anyone it evoked more rule dies than anything else

200
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
The courtroom

201
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
It was part of a line of questioning those pretty effective in Devon

202
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Menstrating Alex was not at all a good faith

203
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Participant in the trial

204
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
I'm a testimony was not something the jury should be taking a place value

205
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
But it has the appearance of being something that owns the lives or something so people made memes and Alex decides to start his show

206
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
With it cuz that's

207
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,407
Yeah yeah yeah that's

208
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
That's sad

209
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
I would want at least more than one

210
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Clip

211
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Of that difference

212
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
You know like

213
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
There wasn't much

214
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,023
Gulf Arab more sad than a few you know

215
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,423
Going to make memes out of Alex like coughing a bunch and like oh you got my phone

216
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
That would be more fun

217
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,495
I would like that

218
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
It's harder to play boxing commentary after the

219
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,503
Then the messages that Alex is one of got knocked out when I convey this

220
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
That one thing I will say

221
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
Is that this episode

222
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
Involved a bit more news than I expect interesting I mean there's plenty of navel-gazing to go

223
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Naturally

224
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
There are some headline

225
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Signs that Alex covers

226
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Our little bit

227
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Fun

228
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,079
Okay we have the official announcement

229
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Elizabeth good

230
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Cannibalism is good

231
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
This is just Alex playing fun games with headlines

232
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
The great the perception that we're on the path to eating each other which doesn't really make sense

233
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,567
I thought Claus she wanted us to eat bugs but never supposed to eat each other if this is dumb

234
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
In the past we've

235
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
Discuss why cannibalism is inefficient as a diet and all but the most

236
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Extreme circumstance

237
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,087
The calories expended to kill a person and eat them would likely not be worth what you did

238
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Get from

239
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
Piano

240
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Bunch of issues even leaving like societal taboos

241
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
It's not a good it's not

242
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,167
It's not a good plan called the most delicious game we're called The Most Dangerous Game

243
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Sprite

244
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
That means it's

245
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Challa

246
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,383
What's going on is that the show Yellowjackets is really popular and that's show that involves a girl soccer team

247
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Brought a plane that crashes into the wielder

248
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Oh Canada

249
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,831
They have to survive for a long time and apparently cannibalism is involved in the pilot episode

250
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
Kind of like a live but not really like it at all

251
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,023
The crash in the show happens in 1996 and the show includes tracking

252
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
Sing the girls who survived in their current lives

253
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
2021

254
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
It's very heavily implied that they're resorting to cannibalism

255
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,263
Isn't entirely based on a need to eat human flesh to survive or no

256
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Is it there's weird stuff going on

257
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
You've watched it I would admit that I haven't but from the reviews and breakdowns I've read it's

258
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
Seems like it has a little bit of Supernatural nonsense and the lord of the

259
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,879
The Flies kind of vibe minute to discuss the plot more but that would involve spoilers and honestly from reading it explained

260
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
And I've no idea what's going on with

261
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
That show and I bet you don't either

262
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,815
It's kind of one of those shows where it's like what if we imply everything

263
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,423
And then we'll get a second season and will will f*** it up then right out

264
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
I think it's

265
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Seems like one of those shows that if I hadn't

266
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Gone along for the entire ride of Lost

267
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Yeah but also flash-forward

268
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
Yep many other shows

269
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,455
Maybe I would jump in tell her they fight

270
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
I'll wait

271
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
See I didn't see lost I didn't see all these things so I'm fine with it for now

272
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,023
Is going to be garbage and I got to be like we're going to explain things and that we midichlorians involve so whenever baby. You never know

273
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,399
How do I in the wake of that shows massive success he was released on DVD in mid-july

274
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
So there is renewed conversation about it including discussion of the coming second season and the cannibalism scene

275
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,151
In the first episode and it apparently wasn't even explained by the season finale

276
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759
People are talking about this show that they're enjoying so the New York Times published

277
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,599
An op-ed about a couple of pieces of cannibalism related creative

278
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
That have come out recently seemingly building on the premise

279
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
The cannibalism is a Hot Topic in fix

280
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
These days

281
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
Naturally the right-wing went batshit over this and created an entire new cycle based on the nonsense idea of the time

282
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,751
Was trying to tell people that cannibalism is actually really cool and maybe they usually pee

283
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
Alex is a shallow thinker and a shallower reader so he's not read this op-ed and I wouldn't be surprised

284
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
If you didn't even read the full text of the breath

285
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,319
Breathlessly outraged response articles that were written about it

286
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,415
But if you had read the original think you would have read this part towards the end

287
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
According

288
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
Miss Summers cannibalism is always symbolic

289
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Burger novel's protagonist

290
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,631
Is eating human flesh can be seen as a way of holding onto a relationship

291
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Ended

292
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,215
For Miss Summers herself the plot of a certain

293
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,335
Hunger can't be uncoupled from quote my own personal experiences with disordered eating

294
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
With the tamping down a summon an appetite

295
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
The way the media choose up

296
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
And spits out writers

297
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,783
Boozie consumption and boujee Lady can sub

298
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Auction Tucson

299
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:33,695
More generally Miss Summers thinks that the recent Spate of cannibalistic plots could be commentaries on capital a

300
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,815
Call cannibalism is about consumption and it's about burning up from the inside in order to

301
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Exist

302
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
Bernard is essentially over

303
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Consuming yourself your own energy

304
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,495
Your own will to survive your sleep schedule

305
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
You're eating schedule your body

306
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,943
The article is a thoughtful examination of some of these social commentaries that are possibly being made by themes of cannibalism that

307
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,271
What are being expressed in a very limited set of pieces of media

308
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
Including a very popular recent series

309
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:06,207
But of course for people like Alex it secretly the times telling everyone that eating people is trending now

310
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Idiotic

311
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Kid s***

312
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
That's the Tiger

313
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
It's but it's fun like at least at least

314
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,703
It's something I mean here's a here's the thing for me

315
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
I'm trying to imagine

316
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
What the real world would look like

317
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
If a

318
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Positive

319
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
Cannibalism article was released you know like

320
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,319
What would that be on right-wing freak out right like we all live in a world where suddenly the New York Times as like a guest

321
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
But we talked to the scientist

322
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,487
And he's like actually we're super nutritious grandparents in front of

323
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,095
What would that look like I definitely get the

324
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
GoDaddy

325
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
A conversation surrounding

326
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Hey

327
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Wonderworld does

328
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Eat insects

329
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,823
And that's not something that is weird to everybody

330
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
It's a cultural thing

331
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
There are a very

332
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Station

333
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
Protein

334
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,111
Reeb read a million times I understand that conversation

335
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Conversation

336
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Never

337
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
Happen as it relates to

338
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Human flight

339
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
It just simply could you would put a name on it

340
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,935
You would be like you'd be like oh yeah so yesterday we had Grandpa Joe

341
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
I thought everybody better have to stop for a second

342
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
The only place at themselves the only way it would exist

343
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
In like

344
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Any kind of publication would be in

345
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,967
It's some kind of bee swiftian satire

346
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
Kind of

347
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
But yeah it is it is funny too

348
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,719
I do appreciate that cuz it does feel more normal for Alex to be like

349
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,071
Either going to make millions how to make you eat people

350
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
Haven't been on such a long like

351
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
I'm a victim

352
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,799
Right it is kind of nice to have a little bit of something else even if it is

353
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,407
Is entirely stupid will accept that that was a breath of fresh air in a certain sense

354
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,991
It's so rancid but it was fresher than

355
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
So there's some other news down in Florida

356
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,207
Songs are going out this before the debate on our luggage don't get too excited

357
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
We're going to hit that right the huge development with

358
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
Police go to the offices of

359
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
Pharos operatives inside the government

360
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,567
But I can't

361
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
The big guy

362
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,711
Oh so that that made us before Mar-A-Lago got raided so this kind of ideas pretty good

363
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
The government figures home

364
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,879
It's pretty cool to do that cuz they're corrupt but

365
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
So this is about

366
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,255
DeSantis firing the Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren

367
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
Because he refused to prosecute cases regarding trans people

368
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,143
And reproductive Healthcare cases

369
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,007
The reason is a big deal and a clear abuse of power is that the state attorney is an elected

370
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Office

371
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Yeah it's what I think

372
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
You can

373
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
You could there are processes

374
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
To remove the person

375
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
The governor just sorted

376
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Little bit

377
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
It's a little bit dicey

378
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Yeah I mean

379
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Do you know it's

380
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
Probably bad if a governor is willing to just

381
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,792
Risk being a fascist and see if it plays it pays off

382
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,376
You know like that so a bad sign is when the governor is like

383
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,960
You know what f*** it I bet there's a 50-50 shot this one works

384
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:34,080
Cuz I think that he really got people voted in

385
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,712
Maybe laterally I'm dictator now I own Florida

386
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
It opens up a lot of doors

387
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,160
So Alex is not going to be hosting the show the whole time

388
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
And then Mike Adams and Studio always amazing

389
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Wow

390
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
Coming up as an hour and he's going also have some big

391
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Gaston

392
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
With him

393
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
Because I've got to go back down to this kangaroo court

394
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
In 15 minutes

395
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
I'll be back this evening I did last night shooting first reports

396
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Free 6 p.m. I should be in there during a lot

397
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
Like our today

398
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
Mike Adams is going to come sailing

399
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
I'll tell you what

400
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
I skipped it

401
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
Health Ranger

402
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Don't dare

403
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,560
Nope gets throat sounds a lot better I'm glad he's feeling better

404
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,680
Smile Bright Now

405
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
So much better that a while

406
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
Like he says he has a cough button and all that and I know that he does

407
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Foods

408
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Attractive

409
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,064
Have an excuse why it was so bad

410
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:53,696
And it's great there was some bad

411
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
Still some navel-gazing there still some talking about his own

412
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Victimhood

413
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,936
And it involves Alex actually accusing the judge

414
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Do criminal Behavior

415
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
And you're not going to believe

416
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
What the judge is doing public

417
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
I believe it's Criminal

418
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
I believe it's

419
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,296
But again

420
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
We'll be right back

421
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Dancer the judge is committing crimes

422
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
In a larger sense

423
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,768
He did speak a real truth which is that we can't even be good to

424
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Blackwell

425
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
Ham

426
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Is is it in

427
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
You know you got two parts that

428
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Run is unable to be at

429
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,336
He's arguing he's not being allowed

430
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,480
To be a person is telling the truth

431
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
That looks really wants to get into this DeSantis

432
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,392
Kicking out the state attorney story

433
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
To bring in a buddy

434
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Derive sidecar with a

435
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Great work DeSantis is doing

436
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,120
Deep State Soros operatives that violate

437
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
Barrows office

438
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
Just gets better and better

439
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
She's actually going after the Deep state

440
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
She is doing

441
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Roshaun had

442
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,000
Special guest Pastor Rodney Howard Browne

443
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
At the bottom of the hour

444
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Prosecutor is the one that had him arrested

445
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Now he's been fired

446
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
By the governor

447
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Show

448
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
2020 Rodney Howard Browne divide Public Health guidance and help church services when large public Gatherings were

449
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,296
He was charged with some things like unlawful assembly but Ulta

450
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,368
Those charges were dropped and he didn't really face any consequences

451
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,744
Very impressed this guy how fun

452
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:09,120
You don't Trump is giving them a taste of fascism and based on Alex's

453
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,008
Current comment about a elected official absolutely wrecking any and all power structures

454
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
I think they want more fascism

455
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
Yeah you could get some of those indication

456
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Clues

457
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,992
I think I'm picking up on here

458
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
So Alex has lost

459
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
The in the cumulative

460
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,976
Satori phase of the trial a little over 4 million dollars

461
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
Answer here he touches on that a little bit

462
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Let me do this now

463
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Because a lot of people

464
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Into the show

465
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
Wanted to get my response to the 4.1 million dollar

466
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
Judgment by Austin jury yesterday

467
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
Video

468
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,712
Eyewear I

469
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,272
Play out about 5 minutes

470
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
My stance on it

471
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Where I stand

472
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
But I'll do that again

473
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
By the tuning lives in a lot of your tuna in their new viewers

474
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:13,376
Going to get my view but there's last night's announcement breaking exclusive Alex Jones responds to 4.2 million Sandy Hook

475
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
Verdict 628 thousand views

476
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
Legosi

477
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
It's very important video

478
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Self-employed

479
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Briefly

480
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
Chronicle

481
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
What's been happening the last week and a half

482
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Almost

483
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
As of today

484
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,760
Kangaroo court

485
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
And how's the model for the rest of the country and the world

486
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
George Soros

487
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
And the operatives are literally

488
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
Coordinating and running this man

489
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
That's quite a scoop

490
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
I would not have said that

491
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Said that

492
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
Why not that's just me

493
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:51,520
You know I'm because and here's why I wouldn't have said it right or not fun

494
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:56,128
Right and it's more it's not so much the jury now or the judge

495
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,944
It's more the sanctions that are coming

496
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,552
Sure you really should also like

497
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
You really casting your bat

498
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
On

499
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
The other trials aren't going to happen

500
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
If you're happy

501
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
Some of this post-trial Behavior

502
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,352
I could easily see it being introduced as like

503
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
Look how do you know where you that he behaves how do you not

504
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,776
I mean in another punitive hearing how do you not go okay

505
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
We did one punitive hearing

506
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,128
And this was supposed to get him to stop doing this

507
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
So here's what he said

508
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
Hours later he decided that he was going to imply that he will not be kept away from that

509
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
Sandy Hook family

510
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
And then

511
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,256
Accuse the judge of criminal Behavior

512
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
So the media

513
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
In on it

514
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Drudge

515
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
Soros operatives unnamed

516
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
Right but definitely in on it

517
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,032
The corporate media in the courtroom

518
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,336
Who is coordinating with the medium

519
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,432
The judgy is altering the record of the trial in my view

520
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,504
By recording

521
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
Just say I'm guilty until the jury

522
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Guilty

523
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Ziebart us

524
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
She barred us

525
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
From

526
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
Being able to respond to the punitive damages

527
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
Dover

528
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
Today I'm an Acura

529
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Net worth

530
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,248
Iceman

531
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Complete list

532
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,648
Under court order

533
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
And then

534
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680
Argument or calling any Witnesses we could only cross-examine

535
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Literally is some

536
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Drift covered

537
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,736
Just joking

538
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
There's like five names

539
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,024
Yep that is my new alias

540
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
Can I give you that that's a good one

541
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:29,728
His name is Bernard Peta guilt

542
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
Snip snap

543
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:37,152
It sounds like that name is missing an Esquire after it though

544
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,528
Yeah you can hear it better but yeah you can hear it choir for lawyers

545
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,928
Something like that but so what

546
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,032
People's Federal goddamn

547
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,336
That's good bad good stuff

548
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:12,736
Stratford-upon-avon

549
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
What about the judge

550
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Falsifying the record

551
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Or whatever

552
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
And so I was I was kind of in

553
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
Interested to hear what that

554
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Matt is that what he was talkin to

555
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
Here yesterday

556
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
Running around the office

557
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Trying to watch the verdict

558
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,240
And she was killing stream every 5 minutes or so

559
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
Because she said she would live streaming

560
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
But we kicked their butts so bad even though we had our hands tied behind our backs

561
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Most of my testimony

562
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
Law & crime

563
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Can only put out edited clips of me

564
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,624
Mason moments

565
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Those

566
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,512
Text messages all come for me on my phone I gave it to all the lawyers

567
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
Now you have it

568
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,240
You guys should act like you didn't have it but his phone

569
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,896
The most generous explanation for this is that Alex is an idiot and doesn't understand that lawn crimes YouTube channel

570
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,200
Posted the long-form videos of the trial

571
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:20,832
And also publisher Snippets of particularly exciting moments like when it's text messages were revealed

572
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,184
Alex doesn't deserve a generous interpretation and the reality here is that

573
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
He's just lying to make his audience think that the judge in this case

574
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Shut down the feed and only allowed these shorter clips

575
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
To go out which is nonsense

576
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,704
It's likely too late for it to matter but I have to assume that this could constitute

577
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Contempt of court

578
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Type thing

579
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,288
He's literally accusing the judge of

580
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
Yeah I mean

581
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,176
They are there still have to work out the exact sanctions for both

582
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Renaldo and Alex

583
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,552
Like that is still in the air it's not like there

584
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
It's not like they

585
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,136
They wrote down the number and they handed it to Alex and they're like

586
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
Okay you can keep being a piece of s*** but you're also going to owe us this

587
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
You know they're still doing that man

588
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,792
I both watched

589
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
Feromonas

590
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
And was there in person and I can

591
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
You can play with

592
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
I need a bit of confidence

593
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
But Alex was not kicking their ass so bad

594
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
Even with his hands tied behind his back

595
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,736
That they would need to shut down the feed the same thing as the courts

596
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,808
Which Alex is intentionally

597
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
Confusing

598
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,904
Respond yeah it's meaningless

599
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,464
But he does stress this quite a

600
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
Televised televised

601
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Real porch so they do it

602
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
A pool camera

603
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
That whoever speaking and Emily judge

604
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
They're all pet media

605
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,736
And they all run the same script and the same Clips out basic

606
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
And turning it off

607
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,696
And turning on and turning it off

608
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
She just killed two strings

609
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,328
Show people the trial

610
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
And then

611
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,056
But I'll certain parts the trial that was something you don't like having to kill the Stream

612
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
He's going down and it's January 6th and all the stuff

613
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
Talk she turns it off

614
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
None of this happened

615
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
No not of it

616
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Not even a little bit

617
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Wild I mean it is

618
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,032
It's just a manufactured Narrative of

619
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
What happened

620
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
It is

621
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
So convenient does it shouldn't it be

622
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,224
Too convenient now for even his listeners that

623
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,552
Everything that proves he's innocent is

624
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Unable to be found

625
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Not

626
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,488
Of course not we're not going to go and look and find the feed like the fool like

627
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
6 hour videos on

628
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
There's no way

629
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:18,752
That you could I mean even though do you think I pulled the clips for our last episode also what

630
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,872
Knows how to competently turn a stream on and off at

631
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:28,736
His lawyer couldn't even figure out how to use a

632
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
F****** 8th grade projector

633
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
No I think we talked I think I have notes about this later

634
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Bring up at like

635
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
We were there in the courtroom

636
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Fan

637
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
The Lime Crime

638
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
Their camera person was sitting next to us

639
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Through a lot of the time during the trial

640
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
And

641
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
They would

642
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,032
Fixing things sometimes

643
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Problem

644
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,152
They had with their their stream

645
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,504
There was at least one occasion where I remember that they came in late

646
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,904
There was like that is a separate entire feed from the zoom

647
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,304
There is literally a moment where the battery got down to like 3%

648
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
That's because

649
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,912
Somebody a jostle their their coordinated popped out

650
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,032
Like you don't know this is just a boring defense for Alex but I think it's what do you want

651
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
To go full-on with it

652
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,456
But it is what you're talkin about you know it is a dynamic of appealing to the unknown

653
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
It's like there's this other stuff somewhere that proves that I'm

654
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,184
Yep I'm innocent but you can never find it

655
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,000
Evil judge

656
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
So Alex

657
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
Certainly pissed off about being jammed up in this trial but

658
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,656
He's got to get to the

659
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,472
World news

660
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
The Restless broadcast

661
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
But I got to finish up

662
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Please

663
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
What's going on down at the

664
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Courthouse

665
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
Railroaded

666
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
It in the in the

667
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
A second phase of the

668
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
I guess we're not getting

669
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
The news

670
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
I guess we're going to do this for long

671
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
At least it's kind of fun

672
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Two middle names

673
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
He said it on the stands I was there this morning

674
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Paraplegia

675
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,592
Goapele

676
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
Google command

677
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Petroglyphs

678
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,624
Mom do you smell

679
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,976
Find him being sworn and he says his name is Bernard Francis petechial Junior

680
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,656
Don't remember goo to the mountainous

681
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,984
I got even at Ozzie mandamus

682
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
I can't stop saying that it's so good

683
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Yep

684
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
So this is this is quite a can

685
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
Conspiracy that Alex's got cooking

686
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Here there are

687
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
I mean it's

688
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,856
Its sprawling are there a lot of players in the game now soulmate

689
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
The judge

690
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Cold all the news

691
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
I've authorized all of you to be here

692
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,888
But no one else is allowed to film interview to I'll have you arrested

693
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Like that

694
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Do you want tape

695
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,032
And then whenever we speak she cuts us off on YouTube

696
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,664
So they can then add the new screws at it down

697
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,528
Down to the same section

698
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Somebody

699
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Everybody on YouTube

700
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
12:50 comments for me

701
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,912
And all the sudden they all get pushed out and deleted a bunch of hateful comments you put the top

702
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Boats

703
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Car push the bottom

704
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
Let's take a step back and try to forget that we're listening to a celebrity racist demagogue here and really listen to what there

705
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
They're saying

706
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Anyone

707
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:17,856
You knew was talking like this about how everyone was out to get them would rightly understand that they aren't well

708
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
But for Alex it just kind of his

709
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
He sounds like someone Raven about black helicopters because he's literally the same person who is Raven about black helicopters

710
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
20 years ago

711
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:33,984
He's delusional and he's not enough people to enable and reinforce has delusions that he's been able to make it profitable

712
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,544
Did inflate himself from any consequences of his actions

713
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
But this just sounds

714
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Dumb

715
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,712
Alex is getting on the show to complain about how unfairly he's being treated which is evidenced by

716
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,784
Completely inaccurate description of how the live streams are brought

717
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:53,696
Then he's heard from other people there's a conspiracy about silencing supportive YouTube comments

718
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,488
Which is just pathetic

719
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,072
Alex isn't even able to make this claim he has to say that other

720
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
People have told him this is happening

721
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,704
He has literally no idea this is real at all but

722
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
It feeds into his victim of status so

723
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,080
Not only is it real it's also probably way worse than it seems

724
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,176
And it's being directed by the judge in coordination with Soros

725
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Alba live stream

726
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,160
As far as the longtime videos are concerned you can go to those and still see a ton of bro Alex comments

728
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
Mostly in the live chat

729
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,280
It's silly to think that YouTube comments mean anything

730
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
A lot of them are Bots

731
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:33,376
Many of them are people just rolling and they're plenty that just don't

732
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Even make sense

733
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
Really sad to see a 48 year-old adult whining on his show but how he's heard that there aren't enough

734
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Positive comments

735
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,896
How about him on some YouTube video so it must be a censorship

736
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Conspiracy issue

737
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Nonsense it's just

738
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:52,576
Yeah I really thought we were done with allowing people to b**** about YouTube comments

739
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,672
I just thought that was done I'm done with allowing it to

740
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
To mean anything

741
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
I mean nobody

742
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,768
It speaks volumes about

743
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
You if you're complaining about it

744
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,864
Everything eats been in movies

745
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
From like 2015 where it's like hey

746
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,240
Don't read the comments on the YouTube to everybody

747
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
Just knows that it's a horrible place

748
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,592
There is still something

749
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Have a conversation in terms of like a

750
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,968
Abusive and directed abusive harassment and stuff

751
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
Don't that that does still exist

752
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Commenting

753
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
And what have you quite

754
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,672
Trying to argue stuff it's like

755
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,744
Oh my tweets are getting enough likes I must be hidden

756
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,608
Must be too dangerous to The Establishment or whatever

757
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:41,728
Yeah the concept of maybe I'm uninteresting is just enough of a property

758
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:47,616
Because he's got Wilfred us TV boring

759
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,920
Turn away yeah the judge

760
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,784
The cover-up man deeply involved

761
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,904
Tell the judges in lifetime manipulating what the world can see

762
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
They don't want you to let it go last week and a half of the trial

763
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
People not figuring out she's doing this

764
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
Everybody's going and finding it

765
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,520
And going and finding

766
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
What they weren't supposed to have

767
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Because

768
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
There were several other groups they're screaming

769
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
The didn't completely

770
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
If anybody else was recording they were committing a crime

771
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,648
Thanks I made based on

772
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,232
My experience of being there in the courtroom

773
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
I don't think

774
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
That was happening

775
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
A couple read

776
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
Yeah if you actual cameras

777
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,264
People like the lawn Crime Check folks documentary

778
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
You also had

779
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
A fair amount of

780
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
Security interlock bailiffs

781
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Yeah and like

782
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Sheriff's officers or whatever

783
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
Court officers

784
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
Hey there's someone was recording and they were

785
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
They didn't have permission

786
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
That would have been shut down

787
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,207
Almost instantly

788
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,071
I don't I couldn't stop myself from laughing a couple of times and I got to visit

789
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
Yeah it's

790
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
Looking around the courtroom

791
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
There

792
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,263
Packed their word a bunch of people there

793
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,591
I don't think there were people who were

794
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,687
Like bootlegging the trial I don't think

795
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Part of it is just

796
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,551
It really wouldn't have made sense to fit more cameras in

797
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
No but have been pointless

798
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:38,975
It wasn't a big courtrooms in that big and there weren't that many people there and I mean ice

799
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
Yeah and I think they knew be interesting and

800
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,607
People would watch it I don't think they thought it would be

801
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
That big of a

802
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,655
Will the courts

803
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,935
Zoom was

804
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
Aaron the entire thing

805
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,567
The Law & crime had a slightly better camera and they were

806
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
Screaming most of it

807
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,943
With some limitations of Defense

808
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,831
Alright whatever was going on camera I think maybe two

809
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
Where to get

810
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
Better shots

811
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
Yeah or the battery

812
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
That it's

813
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
I don't know any

814
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
The judge and answer for this behavior on air

815
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
He's Bass

816
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,191
Basically creating a large Target on her by fabricating conspiracy

817
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,007
That the video in the courtroom was being manipulated in this is

818
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Just completely unacceptable Behavior

819
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Yeah if I was in the middle of being two-faced being

820
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,759
Kingzina Sudan about to get a huge judgment for defaming somebody I would not in the same time. Want to see

821
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,319
People on the judge of that

822
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,623
Places me

823
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
That's kind of what he did when Rodger Stone

824
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
I don't know it seems like

825
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
Just behavior that he can't stop himself because he put a million-dollar bill

826
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,007
It's not only the judge

827
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Tulso the lawyer

828
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
Everyone's against Alex

829
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Noticing

830
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
Up to three or four times

831
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
Every 10 minutes

832
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,063
What

833
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
When y

834
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Signaling each other

835
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Cut the feedback 10 minutes okay

836
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
Ayo the justice department

837
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Everything else we got his whole phone with they don't

838
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Okay rahner and she's like

839
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
The feed

840
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
This is total

841
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Coordination

842
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,223
I do I just I don't

843
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Don't think that this is okay

844
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
Okay

845
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,879
This is a pretty serious accusation that Alex is making all things considered

846
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Ultimately

847
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
Almost right

848
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
I think your people know that

849
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,815
He's full of s***

850
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
There are real dangers that you could be putting people in by making accusations like this

851
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
And you just can't

852
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Do this

853
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,055
Yeah

854
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,615
You can't accuse people of criminal Behavior

855
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,199
In criminal coordination between a judge and lawyer

856
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,551
I don't know if

857
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:15,903
Monsters come out of topsy-turvy world to attack people

858
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
You know

859
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:21,535
Alex lives in topsy-turvy world so we look at it more like a listen you sound like an absolute

860
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
Nutjob baba baba baba baba

861
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
What do you send to people

862
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
Eddie's putting Targets on people that there that are being sent

863
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
The crazy

864
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:35,103
It's not okay it's not okay to be some sort of a check on it

865
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
Yeah okay

866
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Alton got to get

867
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Honestly this

868
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Case

869
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
Is meant to distract him

870
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,063
From this large work

871
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,623
That is so important that he needs to do okay

872
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
They're trying to distract

873
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Acme

874
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
From my work

875
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
But they're not

876
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
From my work

877
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,167
And that's why I'm not down there at the

878
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Enphase the trial today

879
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Is because

880
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
No matter what the globalist

881
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Breathing air

882
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Moana locked up

883
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Present

884
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
I am going

885
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Fighting

886
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Stay in the fight with

887
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
They want me to talk about their attacks they want me to

888
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,559
Sending myself but you you understand where to stand

889
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Not going to let them

890
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Attract

891
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
What is it

892
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
Distract us from welders this

893
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
That's tacky

894
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
It all comes

895
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Back to this tacky

896
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
Distract us

897
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
From knowing about

898
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,671
What I'm about to come

899
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
I'll be back

900
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Today

901
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
In the fourth hour

902
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,655
And I'm going to tell house with Robert Barnes

903
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
I'm in the war room

904
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
Because I'm not going to let

905
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Let me hear most the day

906
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Daughters begging me to take her fish

907
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
She has no future if I don't do this job

908
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,551
I'm not a martyr I'm not a big

909
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
But I'm going to work harder

910
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,927
Because they're trying to silence us because I know it's hard

911
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,631
But we've done together I realize I've got a

912
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,495
I'll cover this morning for Saturday

913
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,543
Then she's not wind up there

914
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
The sideline so you know it's coming up

915
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
I hate

916
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
That like

917
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
Every time

918
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
There's like

919
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:55,135
You know the globalists are really acting up and duty calls

920
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:00,511
The real thing that ends up happening is that Alex's daughter doesn't get to do something fun

921
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,095
How many times has he not taking her fishing

922
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
How many times

923
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,727
Don't tell me about how you need to take it better fishing

924
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
When you haven't that's

925
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
Sad for me yeah there's a

926
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
Beam of light

927
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
I got to fight these globalist

928
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,199
I'm going to take my daughter fishing imagine her sitting

929
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,599
At home with a fishing pole he said he was going to come today

930
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,135
This is a willful

931
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,719
Re contextualize Agera neglectful parenting

932
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Cheers be good news

933
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,327
What's a good plan didn't exist to begin with their 10 fishing trip

934
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,727
Dramatization anyway Alex is going to do a fun run of headlines

935
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,311
And so I decided he's like these are all connected

936
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
And this is what the globalist

937
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,687
We're going to go on this run with him

938
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
What happened

939
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
So here's the first headline

940
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
Swedes eat

941
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:09,887
The headline from 2019 which Alex doesn't know because his team just Googled cannibalism imprinted out everything

942
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
That seems like a good work

943
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,823
Ouch Alex does no prep for the show so he's cooled reading headlines have been making up contacts for them and then miss Casey

944
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
He's pretending that it's a current story

945
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
This was about Magnus soderlund

946
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,295
Two went on Swedish TV and was interviewed about some research he was doing into social taboos about food sources

947
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,159
Basically human meat was used as an extreme example of something that pretty much everyone

948
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,231
Consider past the line but where exactly was the LIE

949
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
Lab-grown beef

950
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Artificial meat

951
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Insect

952
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,399
Where do people feel like I don't know

953
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,775
He doesn't want people to eat people and that wasn't something he was advocating at all

954
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,103
Magnus very astutely deduce that his words have quote

955
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,479
I've been hijacked by people who don't believe that global warming and other climate issues should be

956
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
Be taken seriously

957
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,807
One of those people was a writer for

958
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,879
For the epoch times who wrote a headline that Alex is now reading on air

959
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,255
This is a bulshit story with no connection to reality that was published three years ago

960
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
So this string of headlines

961
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
Is off to a very strong start

962
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,167
So you're saying that the swedes have not started eating each other

963
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
Not to my knowledge okay

964
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:22,079
I truck I don't have anybody on the ground

965
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,663
Oh no

966
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
Video transcript

967
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,527
Transport secretary again towel

968
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,343
Expensive electric vehicles at solution for high gas

969
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
So you have Pete buttigieg

970
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Said that

971
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
Maybe electric cars

972
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:44,351
Maybe we could get some subsidies for people to be able to afford electric cars that is related to eating people have

973
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:48,959
Because he said that this sweetest person said that you should eat people to help with climate change

974
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
Which isn't really true

975
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,639
Sylvia maybe the climate change aspect of it is

976
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,431
I appreciate you trying to track

977
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:04,831
Because they're specifically all connected

978
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Electric cars

979
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,671
Well let's see let's see if we can find some more connective tissue

980
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Hypocrite Trudeau

981
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,047
Hypocrite

982
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,143
I thought it was Obama who didn't want people have air conditioner

983
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Our car which

984
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,239
Isn't truth begin with but it's a lot

985
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
I guess it's

986
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Now to go

987
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,431
I'm starting to suspect the baby Alex really is just gold reading headlines and hasn't seen in any of these things at all buddy

988
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,527
We have a three-year-old article about cannibalism

989
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
Matt Smith Pete buttigieg made about

990
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
The electric-car straight and a picture of

991
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,927
Trudeau not wearing a mask

992
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,767
This can't be the super important work the globalist want to distract Alex

993
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,119
Text Rob because this is ridiculous you know I wrote down earlier

994
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,959
Whenever he was saying like

995
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,007
Confirm my work and I won't allow it and it's like

996
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
If that is true

997
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
Just on its face

998
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,871
The news currently B

999
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Gargantuan

1000
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
You know like

1001
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,759
During the trial now maybe maybe you could even consider like trumps

1002
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:12,159
Ray being gargano's actor

1003
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,719
Holy s*** you know there is there's

1004
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:20,095
Fires going up inside of your home right now because then Alex would be able to cover it

1005
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,167
That would justify the distraction Arrow

1006
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
But I feel like the news was mainly like

1007
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
Now we're going to try and lower gas

1008
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,383
Taxes Sweden has given the green light

1009
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,247
On eating people but Alex doesn't know that and he's presenting his current so

1010
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
So I guess

1011
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Eat up

1012
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
I guess I guess we had to sue Alex Jones to make sure that swedes could eat people let me see this

1013
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,999
I know what the swedes do with meatballs

1014
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:48,767
And

1015
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,583
If that's the president of how they're going to serve people

1016
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,983
I'm out I'm out to let him know thank you I'm just saying that Scandinavian food is not bad

1017
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,335
Food but there are way better for you're not going to trick me to eat people with lingonberry

1018
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,871
I can tell you that right now

1019
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
I won't even eat their fish let alone their people

1020
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,503
Call Boo

1021
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,111
Climate called is eager to take advantage of Europe's energy crisis

1022
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,487
Control remotely they would

1023
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
With the smart meters

1024
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,095
What temperature do you set your house to no lower than 8

1025
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,727
This is just an op-ed on zerohedge that's completely meaningless as proof of anything and doesn't even include

1026
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Any B

1027
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,055
It's about remotely controlling people's thermostats

1028
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,151
That stuff that Alex is writing his own story about

1029
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,711
But it's very real issues surrounding energy rash

1030
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Proposals

1031
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:45,599
In countries that could be more directly affected by Russia's ability to control the flow of oil and natural gas

1032
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
It was a question of remotely

1033
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,231
We controlling smart meter thermostats in Moore city council is being asked

1034
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,279
To do everything they can to conserve enter

1035
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:58,399
After this is a string of headlines about reducing car ownership so I

1036
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,727
I guess that a bunch of these headlines could be said to be connected but

1037
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
I'm struggling to make

1038
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,311
The larger meaningful connection

1039
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,615
Cannibalism is just flashing and fun

1040
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
I guess

1041
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
I think that I understand what Alex

1042
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Once the connection

1043
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:12,735
Centipede but it's

1044
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Pretty much just in his head

1045
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,087
He's basically laying out the climate change advocates

1046
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
It's an elaborate plot

1047
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,975
Destroy Society through making people unable to have energy resources

1048
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,047
Which I make them unable to get any food so I guess the media's trying to

1049
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
Prepare people for the idea of eating other human

1050
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,983
Mind you this is entirely different than Alex's big rant about how he's willing to barbecue is Neighbors

1051
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
The Beatles children

1052
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,823
Alex discusses cannibalism it's actually genius

1053
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,103
Eddie's making a larger

1054
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
The point where is

1055
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:43,455
When people he doesn't like do it eats proof of Insidious plan to depopulate

1056
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,039
This Alyssa headlines is legitimately depressing

1057
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
Eddie does not need a lawsuit to distract

1058
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
For doing his job he's

1059
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,415
Doing fine on his own and his job is

1060
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Completely meaning

1061
00:54:53,951 --> 00:55:00,095
Yeah I don't know you just don't get to complain about cannibalism if you have already made the plan in

1062
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,935
In your mind that your neighbors and feed them to your kids

1063
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,519
High public profile publicly

1064
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:12,383
Cut it out loud you're on the record as bad as being an acceptable strategy

1065
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,687
When it comes to that

1066
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
I feel like you shouldn't be able to do

1067
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
To talk s*** I know it was a pretty

1068
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
Like

1069
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,927
Accidentally hit his window with a baseball bat day

1070
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
So we have a couple more headline

1071
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Even though I had lost my page

1072
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,583
With this

1073
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,167
Australia's Great Barrier Reef

1074
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
With record Coral come back

1075
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,055
The truth is coral reef grow they die they come back they die they come back

1076
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:46,943
So this is reading off Breitbart but it's kind of a dishonest framing of the story

1077
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:53,343
Well it is true that parts of the Great Barrier Reef or seeing considerable healing that's not true that as a whole

1078
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,927
The northern area of the resau gains and hard coral cover but

1079
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,719
The southern section actually went down

1080
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,047
This is good news but it's part of a larger picture

1081
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
What are the main concerns about the reef is hard coral cover

1082
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,447
But another equally important aspect

1083
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Is bleaching

1084
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:14,079
Bleaching is the result of a temperature or weather anomaly that leads to the coral expelling

1085
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,127
The algae that give it its color results

1086
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,407
Sing in the coral becoming White

1087
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,503
It's not Dad at that point but it's at a significantly greater risk

1088
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
And importantly Reese

1089
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
Are complicated system

1090
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:30,463
Dogs that are capable of feeling so if there is some bleaching the coral can become home to algae again and and

1091
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,863
And come back to what you call like a vibrant light right right scientist is that weather events

1092
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
Because large-scale bleaching have been increasing in frequency

1093
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
There been for Mass bleaching event

1094
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,031
In the past 7 years

1095
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:47,359
Experts don't know how resilient the reefs are to this height

1096
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Pressure

1097
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,175
It's an open question

1098
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
Frightening

1099
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
The implication

1100
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,039
Another aspect that is up to

1101
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,599
Concerned is mentioned in a Reuters story about this

1102
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:03,487
Quote the growth in cover has been driven by acropora corals

1103
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,559
Switch the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences said

1104
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,887
Are particularly vulnerable to wave damage keep stress

1105
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,679
And Crown of Thorns starfish

1106
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,799
This is coral cover that is increasing which is good but it's a type of coral that

1107
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:19,871
Highly likely to be susceptible to the sorts of weather event

1108
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
Better be coming in

1109
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
Increasingly common

1110
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,711
Which is a big reason to be worried

1111
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
This increasing cover could lead to

1112
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
The false hope

1113
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:33,439
Or conversely to people like Alex ignoring the details of the story in order to use it as a prop to attack climate science

1114
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
It says invalid

1115
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:39,327
A usual Alex has no idea what he's talking about but he's got a Breitbart headline and that's enough

1116
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,119
The trick is already into the pygmies next

1117
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,215
So yeah we were at we were at

1118
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,263
Museum and

1119
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
Butthole

1120
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Area in

1121
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
San Francisco

1122
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Few years back

1123
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
And they had

1124
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,455
There's a massive section of the

1125
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,223
The place now

1126
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:01,087
Like it used to be something different and now it was just all devoted to the coral reef

1127
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:05,695
And the way the coral is was dying and everything was so f******

1128
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,767
Sad cuz that was their goal was like

1129
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,375
You used to walk in here and see some cool stuff and then be like well that was fun

1130
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Now it's

1131
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
You're going to be like I'm going to go fight

1132
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:21,823
Australians to save the coral reef like that's how you walk out of there and it is a tragic

1133
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
Tragic tragic

1134
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
I meant some of the positive news that ends up

1135
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:31,295
Coming out you hear about the Great Barrier Reef is the result of

1136
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,623
Very aggressive conservation app

1137
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:39,487
Yeah

1138
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:43,839
Does people take Advair e-cigarettes can with everything they've got

1139
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,911
All the time and they will have my

1140
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,311
Yeah I don't even I don't even want you reporting good news about it because then people that can be like all things are getting better

1141
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,895
Reporting enough news about how it's

1142
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Dying every single day

1143
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,527
I think that balance is tough to strike a little bit difficult

1144
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
To get another headline

1145
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Sounds fun

1146
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,183
New findings are reanimating not just dead spiders

1147
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Eggs

1148
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
Stein is real

1149
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,071
Holyshit

1150
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Get the Torches

1151
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,911
I just he think that the soul isn't

1152
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,447
Included with the real anime

1153
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,495
I don't know he doesn't he doesn't

1154
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:27,103
Expound on this at all.

1155
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Goddamnit Alex probably just saw a headline about research that was done at Rice University where they found

1156
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
Dead spiders as a way of gripping things

1157
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,879
Essentially it has to do with how spider legs been

1158
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,695
How old are you really need to do to manipulate them

1159
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Is apply a hydraulic

1160
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
Pressure inside the spiders abdomens

1161
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:50,911
The researchers used a needle to Puff air into them and found that they were able to expand and retract

1162
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,935
The spider's legs

1163
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,495
Personally I think this is a little f***** up

1164
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,079
I don't know how much of a high horse any of us has

1165
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,127
W about like how you going to respect

1166
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,967
The sanctity of dead spider it's weird

1167
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:10,623
Pretty interesting if I stepped on it a few days ago I can't be mad if somebody's like look I can make it it's legs work

1168
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:15,743
Baby Back video with the researchers to one of the things they bring up it's like it's kind of tough to argue with

1169
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,535
Is that it is like

1170
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,839
The great biodegradable material

1171
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
You know like s***

1172
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Something that you

1173
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
Okay you end up in a strange position do if you're like a breeding spiders in order to kill them as respect

1174
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,639
We talked to hope that would not be the past thing

1175
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:38,527
Anyway that's not the application but Alex has taken

1176
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
See that's the issue

1177
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:45,695
As for the pig thing Alex just skimmed a headline about this but it's a little closer to reanimation

1178
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Not

1179
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
This is nothing

1180
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,559
He getting reanimated it's a cellular thing

1181
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:56,959
This has some considerable philosophical implications and could stand to revolutionize processes

1182
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,495
Used in organ donation

1183
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,519
But it's not Frank

1184
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
Anstine or at least not yet

1185
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:06,687
I do find myself unnerve slightly by this portion of it NBC news article about

1186
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
Quote

1187
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
The pigs treated with Organics

1188
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
Startled researcher

1189
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,879
During experimentation the dead pigs heads and necks

1190
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,183
Moves under their own power

1191
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
The animals remained under heavy anesthesia the researchers do view the naked jerk as an indication

1192
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,935
Muscle function was restored after

1193
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Death

1194
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:35,103
If you're someone who believes that all science fiction is secretly real I can see how you might respond to this like Alex does

1195
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,383
It's silly

1196
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,223
But I get it anyway I'm still having trouble with you

1197
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
Connection of all these stories

1198
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:46,367
Even these two stories allegedly about reanimation aren't connected in any meaningful way

1199
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:50,207
At this point I was so bored of this list of headlines that I was getting

1200
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,303
Getting really redundant so I decided it was time to move on from this Fun Run

1201
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
Yeah but

1202
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,863
That story about the pig

1203
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Is like

1204
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
That is something I wish

1205
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
Someone was like Alex

1206
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:07,871
But not Alex yeah maybe a little bit more in touch with reality would have a take on because I think it's

1207
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
Think it's a little bit like your reaction

1208
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
It there is a place for that

1209
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
Right

1210
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
To restore muscle I think what's interesting to me about this

1211
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
Is the idea of

1212
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,279
Consciousness you know like okay you're worried about Frank

1213
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
Consign and all that stuff

1214
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,607
But are you telling me that

1215
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Bebe

1216
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
Consciousness returns

1217
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
You do with it

1218
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Of course not

1219
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:40,895
Otherwise what you're saying spiders have a meaningful

1220
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,711
Reanimation is possible then when I die

1221
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,527
Right I'll dye my Consciousness will end and then

1222
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Suddenly

1223
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,111
I will theoretically awaken

1224
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,903
Years later

1225
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,743
End up in the same word different body like that's not how it works

1226
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,327
No so you don't get it so there's no such thing as a soul is what I'm trying to

1227
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:05,727
That's fine that's not even close to anything that is implied by these right now

1228
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:12,127
The only thing I care about when you talk about pigs coming back to life I'm like I'm worried their souls aren't going to be okay

1229
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,175
It comes up in articles about this

1230
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:19,295
Is the turtle philosophical implications in terms of like what we categorize as death

1231
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,879
Cuz like the ability like if someone has a heart attack in her heart stopped

1232
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,903
Which is

1233
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,487
Is the heart a muscle if they're able to pump the heart

1234
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
Like a creep

1235
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Bring back

1236
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,631
Muscle tissue is that something that they would be able to

1237
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,959
There are all kinds of questions that are raised by this but

1238
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
It's not like

1239
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
You've been dead for a week

1240
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,823
And that we can bring you back

1241
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
I think I mean

1242
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Okay so you're brain-dead

1243
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
They can't bring back

1244
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,247
The function of your nerves so so far as we're aware

1245
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:54,879
I mean what are you just going to jolt people with electricity like in Frankenstein

1246
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,903
I mean

1247
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:03,327
Based on Alex's coverage yeah I think I like that's the plan

1248
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Okay

1249
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Yeah I don't know I think

1250
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,727
What what I've actually read on this

1251
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:14,591
I think we'll find out more when there's more research done

1252
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,663
Pretty early stages on a lot of this stuff

1253
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,831
Probably not Frankenstein or not it's a Dolly the sheep level of bringing people back to

1254
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Gotcha

1255
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
So you brought up the torn lyrics

1256
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:33,791
Actually there's

1257
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
There's a suspect

1258
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,423
Studies show 5G causes major asthma and problems

1259
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Congress

1260
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
This morning

1261
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Show

1262
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Coughing

1263
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Never caught to my wife

1264
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,687
Did you know what the studies are

1265
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,735
5G causes

1266
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
Serious breathing problems

1267
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,599
Coughing like this

1268
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,903
5G areas

1269
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
They need those for self-driving cars

1270
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,535
All the sudden afford self-driving car drives by

1271
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,607
A robot car go by

1272
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,983
Wild robot cars make him cough

1273
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,103
Oh that reminds me outside outside of the courthouse I was making the jokes

1274
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,663
And I didn't erjon reference 5G

1275
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,735
YouTube to Rob do Skydive friend

1276
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,807
And now here is she didn't even know

1277
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,927
The 5G from her phone was causing Alex's coffin the courtroom

1278
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,975
Resume my courtroom is full of 5G

1279
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:41,375
She was the one who had the biggest phone though I noticed that on the stand Alex didn't a 5G is making me cough

1280
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,263
Crazy flies on his show

1281
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
He comes back

1282
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
After having gone to the courthouse

1283
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,759
We have not figured out yet

1284
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,063
Exactly what the judgment will be bought

1285
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
For summer starts

1286
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Display special reports

1287
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
What's going on here

1288
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,207
We get 20 minutes in okay

1289
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
Alex finally shows up

1290
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,279
With Barnes until

1291
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,583
Well even update on that

1292
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,727
But also I should say it Advanced Alex uses an R slur here

1293
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,263
Play just want to

1294
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
It's no good

1295
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:26,943
The Ransom promos earlier cuz for some reason

1296
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Nursery left

1297
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,415
There's so little human communication now though like

1298
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
And that's how the global chart

1299
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
People don't

1300
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Communicate with each other

1301
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
Shopping mall

1302
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
From all of us

1303
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,567
Doxo

1304
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
He wasn't on there for 20 minutes because Barnes

1305
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:57,919
Thought you were

1306
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,991
You didn't need to go on are so you left and they was trying to call Barnes and

1307
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,319
I mean I mean that

1308
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
Dart cars

1309
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:13,535
Absolute Insanity in the courthouse I was

1310
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:19,935
Why was screwed on my phone the whole time screw you could have texted Martin's when he were going to be back to go on there

1311
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,239
Activate the 5G

1312
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,847
Everybody's right to look man

1313
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:33,247
Alex said he was going to cover the news when he came back in the fourth hours are but now he can't cuz Barnes isn't there

1314
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
So sad

1315
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
I'm so sad

1316
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
So sad

1317
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
Demi Lovato

1318
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Good save

1319
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,239
Gorilla Snot

1320
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
All matter service was getting cut off energy

1321
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,175
We've already killed somebody

1322
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Russia starts

1323
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,647
All the wimps that have lived opposite

1324
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:14,463
All the frogs of hidden mine

1325
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
RBS

1326
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,303
It's all over now.

1327
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,863
So I guess we all deserve to die cuz Barnes isn't there

1328
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
This is a mood

1329
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
Quick

1330
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,055
He's so mad

1331
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
Die

1332
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Yeah right

1333
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
Okay I feel like

1334
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:44,927
This isn't like the Judgment hasn't even come down and

1335
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
Oh my God

1336
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,279
A bad mood

1337
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,815
I can tell

1338
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
You will die

1339
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Oh okay

1340
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,167
Because you're living the dream you will be judged

1341
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
Aren't you going to die in the west

1342
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,055
I don't live in a Fantasyland I live in a real world

1343
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
But nevertheless

1344
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,671
Everybody's got their own idea how things work so you go ahead and

1345
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
Do it your way

1346
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Okay

1347
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
I have a

1348
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
Video clips on a play here

1349
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,471
And one of them is Dick Cheney the war

1350
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Criminal

1351
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
The torture master

1352
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
The globalist criminal

1353
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,247
National TV

1354
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,039
He was an enemy of America

1355
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,671
Has the nerve to get up and say people running against his daughter

1356
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
Are the enemies

1357
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
Trump is the enemy

1358
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:03,263
What angle on Dick Cheney putting out a video saying Trump sucks is to lash out at Cheney and say who are you to talk

1359
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
I bet that's fair

1360
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:10,687
Another way to look at it is a journey of the f****** monster of historical scale and even he realizes the Trump is a pile of s***

1361
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:15,551
I guess this is a glass half-full or half-empty thing and yeah

1362
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,623
Yeah it was you guys have fun

1363
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,647
Cool

1364
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
So Barn shows up

1365
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
What

1366
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:29,631
Yeah why pull the car around don't show up Barnes you just going to get his bad mood on you

1367
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,447
No actually Alex's mood changes

1368
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,239
No he perks up a little bit

1369
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:38,079
Makes me think that maybe Barnes is holding or something

1370
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,407
But here's a little secret

1371
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Really close.

1372
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,015
Under Texas law there for million-dollar judgment

1373
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
If they do a huge billion-dollar putative

1374
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,183
At one point something million

1375
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,303
Spinning to the media

1376
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
How there could be there's going to be a

1377
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,775
Completely got on the meeting was recycling this as if it was the truth about sex

1378
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,919
YG

1379
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
Call my wife

1380
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Boulder yard

1381
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,087
Longstaff

1382
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:27,487
In tough times if you think if you think that in Vera's YouTube

1383
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,327
Yard

1384
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,399
We can't afford her Gardener anymore

1385
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,007
Staff that has more than one God

1386
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,567
Oh God so yeah I mean

1387
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:45,407
Alex I think you know there's something about Barnes they just

1388
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
Brightens up a room

1389
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,551
And I think you can feel it Alex is so much happier now that Barnes is there

1390
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:57,951
He's got his buddy there is something about barnes's ability to like weather so much b*******

1391
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,023
And kind of like spin it into like a little positive thing for Alex

1392
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,815
Gifty has

1393
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,887
I think he hypnotizes Alex with his like

1394
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,959
Phrases

1395
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Blank and blank

1396
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
All of the time

1397
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:18,175
Arna

1398
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,759
Always alliterative and it's

1399
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,319
There's something about those speech patterns that I think Alex

1400
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,879
Gets sucked into a bad thing to learn

1401
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
So look

1402
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
Most of this

1403
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,255
Fourth hour is Barnes being full of s***

1404
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
Ryan

1405
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,119
Advertising it's really just trying to get money

1406
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,703
There's my problem I could get major national foods guys

1407
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,519
They're on Hannity and on back

1408
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,335
Babies are smarter than 70%

1409
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:52,223
I have this weird erotic thing to give our lives for the best

1410
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
Oh man that's wild

1411
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:03,231
Did Alex get to survival food buckets from my Patriot Supply

1412
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,535
My Patriot Supply to an iceberg years

1413
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:10,911
I'm not sure if Hannity actually sells food buckets at this point but he definitely did it the past in the past

1414
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
Luther mypatriotsupply.com and have sponsored

1415
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:22,175
Ben Shapiro and Rush Limbaugh and countless other right-wing ship stalkers brightness

1416
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,503
You need emergency food because the government's going to go full dictatorship

1417
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,039
In the rhetoric which is justice

1418
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
Strange coincidence

1419
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:34,719
Really f****** work so what you're telling me is that I can even if I'm a huge Shapiro fan

1420
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,511
Or even if I'm a huge

1421
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
Glenn Beck

1422
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Stan

1423
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
What I should do

1424
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:44,447
Hey is instead of getting my trip Patriot Supply from them I'll get a cheaper price from Ali

1425
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Correct

1426
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:51,871
In theory yeah but I don't think that's true I mean I have in the past gone and looked it like various

1427
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
Deals that were offered

1428
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
I don't think that's true

1429
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
What I think is

1430
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,039
Going on if I was just describing anything that's

1431
01:13:59,295 --> 01:13:59,807
Real

1432
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,343
It's that he has such a

1433
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,159
Bad negotiating position that he gets a lower cut

1434
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,999
Then Ben Shapiro or Glenn Beck.

1435
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,559
That would be my hunch

1436
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
Yeah that's more like

1437
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
But yeah it's all

1438
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,167
But the same

1439
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:15,935
Company that

1440
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
It's buying all the

1441
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
These people there

1442
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,799
Probably not Jim Bakker though I think he probably has a

1443
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,615
Different operation keep puts his own food in those bucket

1444
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
Yeah yeah yeah

1445
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
He cooks it himself

1446
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,479
He self interesting Theory

1447
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
About what's coming in the punitive

1448
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Kate's here

1449
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
Even join in the verdict

1450
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,903
In for the punitive damages they need you Nana

1451
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:40,511
Steven get any punitive what's your prediction this afternoon

1452
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,679
Show me kiss your ass what you said before haven't you

1453
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
You said I think

1454
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,919
Seven-figure verdict I don't think the punitive damages

1455
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,711
Just going to come anywhere near what they're talk

1456
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Because the cap

1457
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
25 between both

1458
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,391
Before Alex

1459
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,207
Be going in the direction of

1460
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,023
Yeah they're very much downplaying

1461
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,119
What will come back part of their like

1462
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
That's that

1463
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,703
Storyline that's still going on that they like

1464
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,031
Impaled the jury and like they saw through it and everything

1465
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,383
I mean it's going to be a little bit of a deflation when the

1466
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,663
50 million

1467
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,199
Number comes around

1468
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,295
It's interesting to hear about the cat because

1469
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,599
The more I read about it the less

1470
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
Clear it becomes

1471
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,719
And from what Mark told me is that part of the reason

1472
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,023
That this whole thing is going to get weird

1473
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Is that

1474
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:50,911
If they want to they can there's something written within the Caps of like

1475
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,471
If this is extraordinary bulshit

1476
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,775
Beyond what anybody who could reasonably expect

1477
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,055
F*** the cap

1478
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,127
Let's go hard on this guy you know like that kind of thing

1479
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:03,711
But that's going to lead to appeals and appeals and all that stuff

1480
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,759
So I'm not sure but

1481
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,807
Whatever anybody is reporting about the

1482
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
To cap it is

1483
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:14,207
Up in the air still a number of different Dynamics. Play

1484
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
Oh yeah and

1485
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Is as far as I know like

1486
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,655
About anything about the case and about how this all works

1487
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,703
Let's see what happens

1488
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,311
No idea

1489
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,455
Wrote this law yeah and I think that Alex is entire bankruptcy situation over complicated even more

1490
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,247
And could work to his disadvantage

1491
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Right

1492
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,295
Tulsi

1493
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,647
Barnes decides he's going to jump in with Alex on this whole life

1494
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,951
The judge is committing crimes

1495
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:50,303
I'm staying great idea for a lawyer

1496
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Criminal

1497
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,887
Savage judge say this televised

1498
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,191
Then she cut the YouTube off and we speak

1499
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Warriors

1500
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
Having their people

1501
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
I mean I think that's wrong

1502
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,551
Because even a liberal Democratic jury in Austin that way

1503
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,343
Selected by these planets

1504
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,623
Lawyers rejected

1505
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
The core aspects

1506
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
So their Theory

1507
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,207
C u r a l

1508
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
And you are not

1509
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,743
At the caricature

1510
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
They tried to make you out to be

1511
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,095
And even though they played

1512
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
Video sometimes only 5c

1513
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
7 Seconds

1514
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Like 2 seconds

1515
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,751
What about he was five seconds

1516
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
I personally

1517
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,383
I would not

1518
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Put the allegations

1519
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,223
Concerns about The Judds into the

1520
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,039
The trial you know who else didn't want to put Barnes into the trial

1521
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
Barnes

1522
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,415
He was Alex's lawyer until she got too hot and he quit or got fired and now

1523
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:52,511
Themeforest corporate Rapids testified under oath that they're exploring suing a malpractice

1524
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,559
Such horseshit

1525
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
Barnes is a week loser hiding on Alex's show pretending to have an expert opinion acting like the reality

1526
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,519
Then he took an active part in this didn't happen

1527
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:10,175
How does he pretend to be a lawyer and then get on air and say that the case was scripted in the plaintiff attorneys selected the jury

1528
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,503
As if that wasn't a process of the defense was equally involved in

1529
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,527
Poorly

1530
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
We're just low

1531
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
Yeah this is nonsense he should be

1532
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Like

1533
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,159
I don't know he should give up his own license

1534
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:26,559
Engaging in this s*** is if I was the defenses lawyer whenever they chose the jury I wouldn't have

1535
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,583
Will you talk to me

1536
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
Will you talk to me

1537
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
I don't think he even knows anything about that

1538
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Vicky does either

1539
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,775
Show me one last clip here from Friday

1540
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,079
Show Italy

1541
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,127
This is just

1542
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,687
Here is the same lawyer

1543
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,247
That the worst part is I said lock her up

1544
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,575
We're here because he criticized Hillary here it is

1545
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
I know he was Reckless

1546
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,231
Alex knows he was Ralphs

1547
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,023
Immediately going

1548
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911
Megyn Kelly

1549
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,799
The truth

1550
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
The runner website

1551
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
Hillary Clinton

1552
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:25,695
Wow you guys are good at fake laughing

1553
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,463
They're like

1554
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,999
Literally

1555
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Hillary Clinton's butt

1556
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Politically dead

1557
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:35,935
Have to ask yourself of Alex even thinks his audience is Concha

1558
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:42,335
It's clear what Wesson saying that clip that Alex is trying to dodge responsibility for his actions by saying

1559
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
Other people said things too

1560
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:49,247
And then he punctuated his Claim by joking that he was surprised that Alex didn't yell lock her up

1561
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,063
I was just pretending that this is somehow a statement of

1562
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,879
Support for Hillary or did mention that this case is only happen

1563
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,903
Nothing because of Hillary

1564
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,719
But it's pretty tough to get there from what the actual

1565
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:05,119
Clip that is played at that is so impregnable obvious

1566
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
Yeah that is its this is if

1567
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:12,543
This is the most gaslighting so that you can do

1568
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:18,944
This is too dude lying their asses off about the situation they're in trying desperately to put on a triumphant face for the audience

1569
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
They need to keep giving them money

1570
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:27,648
If there wasn't a resolution they could be spun as a victory here the audience who probably get it through their heads that sending Alex money is through

1571
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
Throwing your money into a pit

1572
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
So it's critical.

1573
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,792
Keep a stiff upper lip and pretend that you're having a great time being sued

1574
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,072
You actually won

1575
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
What do you think about it

1576
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,680
I mean rejected the theory and thesis

1577
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,008
Ninini and assert

1578
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Incense

1579
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
What has happened

1580
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,896
Is that Alex Jones is money-making operation

1581
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,944
Is now a savings account

1582
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
For the fam

1583
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
So

1584
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
The more money he makes

1585
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,088
You know it's going to them

1586
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,112
At the end of the day

1587
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:02,976
Unless he's getting real fancy with some bookkeeping if he's if he's getting real fancy with

1588
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Bookkeeping

1589
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
You going to jail and I think that'd be better than having a savings account

1590
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,144
Well it would certainly limit his ability to

1591
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,680
Bulshit

1592
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
So

1593
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
The world comes on

1594
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Santa our boy

1595
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
Duck Destroyer

1596
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:20,128
Aka the puppet comes on

1597
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
I'm sure

1598
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
And

1599
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
Is a little bit dramatic

1600
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,040
A little bit this is Mike Adams level dramatic

1601
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Burning point

1602
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Dean

1603
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,720
The political paradigm

1604
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,792
It has happened in the West

1605
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,120
That used to Value individualism

1606
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
Freedom

1607
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
Prosperity

1608
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
Life

1609
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Creation

1610
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,336
What and we now pivot into Ada's

1611
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
Western world

1612
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Good values

1613
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Oppression

1614
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:59,040
Humanity

1615
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
Population

1616
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Satanism

1617
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Anti-freedom

1618
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Anti truth

1619
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
Portent

1620
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,280
Turning Point

1621
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,096
Portent

1622
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Is that

1623
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Now

1624
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
American left

1625
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,264
The liberal Progressive

1626
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,312
America

1627
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
I'll take it off the mask

1628
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
And they are now

1629
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
Embracing it

1630
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Now in human his

1631
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,536
This is some serious babyshit

1632
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
In all the course of human history

1633
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:50,240
Good or bad decision that ever been made the Ted geopolitical consequences many by left-leaning politicians

1634
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,544
Nothing compared to the day that Alex Jones learned

1635
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,848
He has to pay people for defaming them

1636
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,504
What's at the end of the Free World when Fox settled their defamation suit with Seth Rich's parents or when CNN settled with Nicholas

1637
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,552
I feel like it wasn't

1638
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:06,112
Probably because Alex is narcissism is so strong

1639
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,904
Such an important part of what makes this

1640
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,208
Show and everything on Infowars work

1641
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:14,048
For the audience that onesa tap into it in order to exist in that environment

1642
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:20,960
This is really pathetic to act this way and I have zero respect for Owen or his proclamations of us announcing that we are the bad guy

1643
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
Guy butt

1644
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:24,800
He wants to act this way I've just one thing to say to him what's that

1645
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,824
Hey yo

1646
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,664
Basketball reference you would have got back

1647
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,832
Scott Hall was the bad guy

1648
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
Can't see nobody

1649
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,880
It's just you and me here

1650
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,464
So you do know an audience you know but yeah

1651
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,792
Bad times don't last bad guys do

1652
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,864
Okay

1653
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,448
In the tradition of Alex before him

1654
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:56,032
Oh and decides he's not hosting her show today either

1655
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,824
Ladies and gentlemen it is Friday August 5th

1656
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,920
Infowars War Room broccoli by infowarsstore.com

1657
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:08,064
And I have to tell you today broadcast is going to be a great one now I am live and studio right now

1658
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
Play Clark is about to take over with

1659
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
So many great guy

1660
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,440
That it

1661
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
It's going to be a great

1662
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Transmission

1663
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,376
So quick Clark is this guy who does the reawakened America Tour and they go and do these like

1664
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,960
Qanon adjacent speakers and lightning

1665
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,240
Alex was at 1

1666
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,824
Jim Breuer

1667
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:36,224
Does anybody work there like when they look dude I understand what you're saying but

1668
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,016
Far as Owen goes imma give him a pass

1669
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:45,696
It keeps like having to host his own show and altitude of True Life true I have a little bit of sympathy

1670
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:52,096
For him cuz they are making him do double duty of a

1671
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,144
Alex's punitive

1672
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,544
Alex just decided I want to go to the core is like

1673
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Some big gas

1674
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Sure clay Clark has a big gap I was like I don't believe this okay

1675
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,736
Clay Clark

1676
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
Sparked start

1677
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,088
Gerald

1678
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
What up my brothers

1679
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:22,816
This is quite a Duo

1680
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:28,192
We all know Mike Flynn but Peter Navarro isn't necessarily someone who's been on Alex's show in the past

1681
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
Not to my knowledge

1682
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,336
He was an aide within the Trump Administration and overall he's basically a s*******

1683
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,664
He's currently facing contempt of congress charges for refusing to

1684
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,296
Comply with subpoenas in the investigation into January 6th he's also in hot water for conduct

1685
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:48,160
Official government business on a private phone and then refusing to turn over records from that phone

1686
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:51,232
Insisting that he needs to be granted immunity Before He'll do so

1687
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
For this whole thing is setting.

1688
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:00,192
Here we have a real qanon adjacent government overthrowing Enthusiast panel

1689
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Happening

1690
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
Not quite sure what I expected from the war room but I'm open to seeing where this goes I mean that is

1691
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,640
That is a bold

1692
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,920
Statement to come out with

1693
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:16,320
Welcoming General Flynn and Peter Navarro today and it gets better

1694
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,624
Crazytalk okay we go

1695
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,464
Mike Lyndell here who what

1696
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,256
What is happening

1697
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
He all he says

1698
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,680
Mike

1699
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,496
We know that you three are going to somehow be in that white house

1700
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,032
Serving what's President Trump

1701
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,824
What what

1702
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
Everybody America

1703
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
Needs to know right now is p

1704
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
People are being this

1705
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
Discouraged demoralized

1706
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,456
What would you like

1707
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,552
The same thing I did on the

1708
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
Everybody we've got all the

1709
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,672
You need to watch

1710
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208
August

1711
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,512
21st is called the moment

1712
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
48 hours

1713
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,400
Spokane

1714
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Forever

1715
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,544
So when like the president to the former president calls

1716
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
Mike Lindell the best advisory

1717
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,408
What that translates do is he's a mark

1718
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,736
Is a hill fund anything

1719
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,040
I wouldn't want to be called the best ad buyer

1720
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:19,808
No

1721
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:23,904
The dumb thing to call someone better ask some real serious questions if someone calls you that

1722
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
Mike lindell's

1723
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,208
Has sounded like

1724
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,792
He's starting to sound like a Graveler

1725
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
Older Jesse Ventura

1726
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:38,240
Well they are both her Minnesota right will that make sense

1727
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,848
I've heard in the past

1728
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,688
Yeah Mike Lindell holy

1729
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,808
So he stopped himself from doing these telephone in the middle

1730
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,648
The last one is going to prove that China stole the election was

1731
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,184
Complete disaster in this one is

1732
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
Is not going to go better

1733
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:03,072
I went to the website for this Summit there's actually really spitting image on the landing page

1734
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,608
It's Mike

1735
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,936
Mount Rushmore waving American flag

1736
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,520
Conveniently he's obscuring Lincoln's face with that flag

1737
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,336
Something of a symbolic expression intentional or not

1738
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:20,480
Of his and his movements desire to rerun the Civil War and undo the whole emancipation thing

1739
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:27,392
On day one of the summit Lyndell is going to have a Premiere screening of the film selection code which goes into how the

1740
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,416
Election was stolen

1741
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:32,512
It was funded by Lindell and largely is about to Tina Peter

1742
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,816
Who you may remember as the election

1743
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608
Conspiracist who was arrested

1744
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,168
For allegedly facilitating a security breach

1745
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,448
Vidmate 121

1746
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:46,336
He was a county clerk in Mesa Arizona capacity there she enable data from the

1747
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,664
And to be leaked and ultimately publishing Acumen on telegram Channel

1748
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:53,760
He recently lost an election she was in running for Secretary of State

1749
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:58,368
He lost in the GOP Primary only getting 27% of the vote but of course

1750
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,696
She insist that you want and the election was stolen because

1751
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
Why not

1752
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:06,816
Anyway Lindale pay to make a movie about her and he's tearing it at his big Summit

1753
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Then

1754
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:12,448
On day two we get something truly exciting that I might actually tune in for

1755
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,240
From 11 a.m. to 6

1756
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:17,312
30pm we have the trial of the machine

1757
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,896
Except on the site they misspelled trial so it actually says Pray Love

1758
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
The machine

1759
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,736
My God there's no explanation for this other than quote

1760
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,808
Mike Lindell puts the voting machines on trial

1761
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,112
Seven and a half hours

1762
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
Madness

1763
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
Are you telling me that the boy Pope has dug up the old Pope and we are putting the pope on the sea

1764
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,168
Yes if you're lindell's kid and up by the way I don't know if he has kids

1765
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,960
You got to be pissed at a run

1766
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:51,360
He seems to have an endless supply of money to waste but you got to know that eventually it's going to run out in before your very

1767
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:57,248
Very eyes your inheritance has turned into a two-day vanity livestream with a seven-hour fake courtroom scene

1768
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,296
We're dad pretends to indict a laugh

1769
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
Grim stuff man

1770
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
Anyway

1771
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:04,160
This is quite a painful of gas Towing

1772
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:07,744
This feeling is put together real bunch of top-notch it heads

1773
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,024
That that

1774
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
Quote

1775
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:13,632
We're going to see all of you in the White House when Trump gets back now

1776
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:20,032
Like you know in the normal corrupt World we've lived in for a long time you know your big donor all of a sudden after

1777
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,104
You get elected holy cow you're in bassador to like Switzerland

1778
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,384
What a great job

1779
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,016
Sure you offer giving us all the money there's some corruption but everybody lives their own life

1780
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,064
If it's Mike Lindell and Trump

1781
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,672
Please like your treasury secretary now you're the best at Beyer I've ever seen

1782
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:43,072
Nobody can control the flow of money better than Lyndell my God

1783
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,096
Bedtime

1784
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,400
So he can't help himself he's got a pop in

1785
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,616
Jones covering Allen

1786
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
Call Jones

1787
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Live on the air

1788
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,480
Listen going 4-0

1789
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
It's not meta that self

1790
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
Narcissistic

1791
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:10,976
It's not metaphor Alex to complain about his own perceived victimhood on his show it's just any other day on Infowars

1792
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,816
I understand Owen wanted to dress this up as something other than vanity but that's

1793
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:21,728
What size poking around on that reawaken America Tour website cuz I was really bored during this interview and I found that

1794
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
On September 24th

1795
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,288
Tulsa Oklahoma

1796
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,872
They're putting on a comedy show with Jim Breuer that promises to be

1797
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,736
Bee quote like a non-communist version of Saturday Night Live

1798
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,320
I know very little about SNL personally but I don't think that the workers can

1799
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:42,208
Control the means of production their boy from what I understand of operations

1800
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,608
I think says SNL is a pro-fascist situation

1801
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:55,008
Character based around him with the whole nature

1802
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,544
To that show is quote

1803
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,640
Steve Jim Breuer is Biden for a night Joe Biden won't remember

1804
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
I guess the joke is there Biden

1805
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:08,320
Forgetful but the joke kind of works the other way to know about it

1806
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
He's a bit doing

1807
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,392
He couldn't care less about some skits

1808
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,184
Jim breuer's doing the front of a bunch of

1809
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
Qanon aunts and uncles

1810
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,512
But also torn

1811
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:23,936
Try to get an opening there's a spot

1812
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,984
50 rattle it off no big deal

1813
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,288
I've seen Breuer standup

1814
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
And you could open

1815
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,616
I could close

1816
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,504
Station Apartments

1817
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,624
But yeah via the flyer for this is fun

1818
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,208
Because it has a picture of Jim Breuer in a gray wig

1819
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:54,144
I am worried I'm worried for swery carry because now we've got a new biting in the mix

1820
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,288
Oh no this one's clearly a clone that's gone wrong

1821
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:03,616
All the American fighter

1822
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:04,896
Hoof

1823
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:08,224
Open pops

1824
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
And it's because there was an expectation

1825
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
That

1826
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,064
Alexa is going to be on

1827
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
Dorrough

1828
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Talk about

1829
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,648
The damage

1830
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Came down

1831
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,952
And unfortunately Alex

1832
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,280
Will not be appearing on the War Room

1833
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,584
Three wise men

1834
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,168
Johnny Jackson champ

1835
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,824
He ain't going to be in today

1836
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,592
Add comment

1837
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
From Alex

1838
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
This time

1839
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
However

1840
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
He is going to be issuing a restraining

1841
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
Bond that

1842
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
Directly uploaded to band

1843
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Video

1844
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,368
Infowars.com

1845
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
So

1846
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,184
Be on the lookout

1847
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
I am on the lookout

1848
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
I thought you might have yeah

1849
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:02,496
Is an hour long video no you don't need an hour to say fuk fuk fuk fuk

1850
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,336
Mostly just like iwantmati of greedy bunny

1851
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,872
And

1852
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,480
Barnes

1853
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,808
It's here it's just whining

1854
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Credible time

1855
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,648
Lay out how this

1856
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,416
Show trial of

1857
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Century

1858
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
That would make

1859
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
The Nazis blush is

1860
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Robert Barnes

1861
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,328
Robert simple incredible

1862
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,608
No doubt I mean Bass

1863
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,376
Physically

1864
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,656
Even the Soviets tried to

1865
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Show trial Italy

1866
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Good show

1867
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
The show trial that

1868
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
It was so one-sided

1869
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
So evidently part

1870
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,312
Made for the movie

1871
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,080
Scripps

1872
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:40,384
I was talking to Mark Rober the other day in this

1873
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,664
The Hollywood screenwriter

1874
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,688
And even he was shocked

1875
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:44,480
To hear how it was basically

1876
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,504
Design of quorum

1877
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,272
Design like a

1878
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,040
A set

1879
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,832
With three big movie cameras

1880
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,624
With the judge alternating

1881
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,416
To be sad when

1882
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,952
Should be sad and how it could be set in

1883
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,232
And who could who could say it

1884
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,792
In such a way that had nothing to do with the rules of Evan

1885
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
But it's nothing to do with the rules of law intact

1886
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Nothing to do with constant

1887
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Douche to Liberty Center

1888
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,680
And everything to do with

1889
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
Escrip

1890
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
Working a case

1891
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,496
So that it would have it for

1892
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
Killer outcome

1893
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:10,080
And in particular at a future media narrative

1894
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,640
Response and ultimately an actual

1895
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,920
Future movie

1896
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,480
Do these guys know what the Nazis did

1897
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,320
The Nazis with a blush

1898
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,136
This trial I mean little offense

1899
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,184
Yeah I was in the courtroom

1900
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,584
For a lot more of the casement mediastar Bobby Barnes and I can see very clearly with no hesitation that the courtroom

1901
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,120
Was not laid out like a movie set

1902
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,400
And it wasn't following

1903
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,168
The script

1904
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
I get that

1905
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:39,008
Convenient narrative for him and Alex to push because they lost

1906
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,360
Austin The Fallout in this case is going to be spectacular but this is a weak attempt at damage

1907
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
Control or whatever they're doing

1908
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:51,552
There were few cameras in the courtroom like I mentioned but they were all the same people's cameras

1909
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:56,928
What was the Court's zoom camera wanted the lawn crimefeed there were HBO cameras for the documentary

1910
01:35:57,184 --> 01:36:02,816
I do not know there was a sign on the door to the courtroom that advise people that there was a crew from HBO filming and if they didn't

1911
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,608
You consent to be in the background of shots

1912
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,632
They shouldn't come in

1913
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
Beyond that there really wasn't

1914
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,984
Much of an effect of cameras had on the actual case

1915
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:15,360
The place where cameras were much more involved in making a scene relates to Alex's action

1916
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:19,456
How the first Tuesday the first day of the case proper Alex Hilda Mini

1917
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,016
Press conference in the hallway for all the cameras

1918
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,088
Yelling about how you been Railroad and how this is a show trial

1919
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,392
That was the video where we're standing in the background

1920
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,184
People remember that

1921
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:35,840
After being scolded about how that wasn't appropriate at lunch Alex tried to do it all again in front of the courthouse but there was no

1922
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,120
Omerta watch a movie tantrum

1923
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,936
Alex wanted a show trial vibe

1924
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:44,800
He wanted there to be tons of national media Crews there covering the case but he didn't get that

1925
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:50,432
I think it's instructive to understand that this complaint that there were all these cameras actually expressing

1926
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,480
Alex and barnes's disappointment

1927
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,064
But there were cameras there that they could exploit for their own purposes

1928
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:59,392
It's less about the cameras and more

1929
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:04,512
To control the narrative which is something that they're fully used to being able to do within the Infowars Bubba

1930
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,584
Adjudge pushing back on that knee for Alex

1931
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,144
Control all aspects of how he's allowed to speak

1932
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:10,912
Represent

1933
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:15,008
Himself it seems her trying to create a false narrative which makes total sense

1934
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,848
Actual reality encroaching on the fake reality he lives in is it

1935
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,128
Experience doesn't attack

1936
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:23,200
Because it's the only way that fake reality can maintain it

1937
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
Its existence

1938
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,272
If you are

1939
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,320
If you're a lawyer

1940
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
If you're a

1941
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Lawyer

1942
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,392
Right

1943
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,464
I should not be allowed to play that clip

1944
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,000
Before

1945
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:37,536
We get into a law

1946
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,584
Argument or something you know like

1947
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:45,984
If I if I'm in it if I'm a lawyer and barnes's across the the the hole for me and he's on the other desk

1948
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:50,592
Should not be allowed to play that clip and be like Barnes is not taking law seriously.

1949
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,128
Like not at all

1950
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,920
This guy is not a lawyer

1951
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
Stop

1952
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,968
Stop letting him law

1953
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,504
Just take law from him

1954
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,784
I think

1955
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:05,440
I mean look I'm not involved in law so I don't know what is and is not relevant to our various things but

1956
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:10,560
I would allow it to the law

1957
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,888
Yeah I would say so especially after this next

1958
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,704
Let me hear this

1959
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:21,056
This is incredible Robert Barnes continuing with your observations both

1960
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,616
Watching the trial on tv being down there

1961
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,920
Having live coverage of it why you say it's the

1962
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:26,944
Most insane

1963
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,504
It is because well first mother

1964
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
How much was in a right to

1965
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
If the judge didn't violet

1966
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,576
First Amendment right

1967
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
Expressions

1968
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,880
Association freedom

1969
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:35,648
The Press

1970
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,184
Second Amendment right to speech

1971
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,208
In favor of the second

1972
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,768
Fourth Amendment rights of private

1973
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,048
She violated that

1974
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:42,816
Repeatedly through

1975
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,864
Knowing what went on into this

1976
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
Discovery being unduly

1977
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,192
Invasive but in fact turning over in

1978
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:48,960
Telling the plaintiff

1979
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,984
Why are you could turn over

1980
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Protected by the

1981
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
4th amendment 2

1982
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,336
Virginia

1983
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
Or whomever else

1984
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
Fifth Amendment rights to due process

1985
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
Denied rights

1986
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
B-flat motions

1987
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
Denied right to bring

1988
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,296
You brought all of them

1989
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,064
Judgment motion

1990
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,368
Do counseling conference

1991
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
Infringed by the

1992
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,976
In the right to confront those making activate

1993
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
Seventh Amendment rights

1994
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
The trial by jury

1995
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,608
And that means a right to trial by jury on all facts

1996
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
The facts

1997
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
The judge decide

1998
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
Can be tried

1999
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,728
And that all of those same analogous Federal

2000
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,032
Provisions have analog

2001
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
In the state

2002
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
Constitution

2003
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,432
Wendy's dude laughing about the case couple hours ago like fake laughing

2004
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,248
So weird how this judgment change their mood a little bit

2005
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,064
I would like to give a rebuttal to barnes's claim

2006
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:40,928
On the First Amendment front he gives no explanation for how the judge violated Alex's First Amendment

2007
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:44,000
There's a certain of the fact and I can test that

2008
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,072
Barnes could never make that case in court because if he could

2009
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,888
You kind of expect you would still be Alex's lawyer

2010
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:54,240
Considering those a huge part of barnes's argument back when he was Alex's lawyer

2011
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:59,872
On the Second Amendment side is he saying that the judge didn't allow Alex to bring a gun into the courtroom

2012
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
I'm unclear on this

2013
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
I believe he's saying

2014
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,528
That by not allowing Alex to describe as his reasoning

2015
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,808
The Second Amendment

2016
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:10,624
That is a violation of the second

2017
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:16,512
No cuz that's just the first amendment thing all over again it's not also at a violation of the first month

2018
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
These rights are violated

2019
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:21,888
I know it's a Barnes isn't accusing the judge of violating the 3rd Amendment which is good

2020
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,704
I would hate to hear that Alex was forced to quarter any soldiers during

2021
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:31,104
The trial

2022
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,432
Judge Campbell didn't rule on whether or not mark

2023
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:36,224
Could turn over Alex's phone data

2024
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,040
She specifically said she wasn't going to get in the middle of

2025
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:45,952
Either way it's not an invasion of his privacy because it was accidentally disclosed by Alex's the proper channels before bring

2026
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:52,352
Can get up if Mark had gotten the text through clandestine memes and that would be a different story but this was rain all f***

2027
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,120
Walking

2028
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,264
Also nothing about discovery which Alex didn't even cooperate with violated Alex's 4th amendment rights

2029
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
This is stupid

2030
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,592
Alex's Fifth Amendment rights are fully intact

2031
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,944
He was not compelled to testify against himself and he had all the due process and a****** can get

2032
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:11,040
You had every opportunity to participate in the case but chose not to

2033
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:16,672
Civil and Criminal Courts cannot operate if people can just decide that they've made up their mind that they've

2034
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,208
Jammed up so they don't get

2035
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:19,744
I have to participate in the case

2036
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
And any attempt to make them for 2

2037
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
Exactly the state railroading

2038
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
Sometimes

2039
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:29,472
It does happen that innocent parties get caught up in protracted process he's defending themselves

2040
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
And that sucks

2041
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:34,848
But that's also why there are mechanisms in place to compensate people who have to go through that

2042
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,896
NYU can powder sue if you need to

2043
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,224
The sixth amendment doesn't apply since it's about criminal cases

2044
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:44,576
And 7th Amendment only requires jury trials for civil cases in federal court

2045
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Asceticism

2046
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,672
And Barnes are saying that their analogs in

2047
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,488
State Court then why you talking about the Constitution dumb dumb

2048
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,024
Good golf Barnes of the lawyer

2049
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,816
You should know better and he does

2050
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,584
He just doesn't

2051
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,912
He's not a lawyer he's someone who knows lost

2052
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,960
Happy to use fat loss.

2053
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
How to draw

2054
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Justified right wing

2055
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
Idiot Sancho's like this

2056
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:06,080
Amazon podcast with Viva Frei

2057
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,616
Small point

2058
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:12,736
The guy who tried to storm that Ohio FBI office allegedly posted this on true social

2059
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:17,344
I'm having trouble getting information but Viva Frei said Patriots are heading to

2060
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,136
The Palm Beach where Mar-A-Lago is

2061
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:22,208
I recommend the going it and being Florida I think

2062
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
The feds won't break it up

2063
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,024
If they do kill them

2064
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:31,168
Firebarn Zyra and I really wanted to like evoking Amendment for Alex I would go with it

2065
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:31,936
18th

2066
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,704
Nasher

2067
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,264
That was repealed by the 21st amendment but

2068
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,824
If there was ever a right Alex could use right about now it's the

2069
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
The prohibition of alcohol

2070
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,664
See that

2071
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,504
I know I am sponsor Islam

2072
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,112
I'll give you that calm down the booze Alex you know it is it is

2073
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,208
It's so annoying when people are like I ever more polarized than ever

2074
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
But

2075
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,792
There is an argument to be made that

2076
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,816
Somehow

2077
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,888
More amendments were passed

2078
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:06,752
After or before prohibition was repealed do you know what I'm saying

2079
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
Like

2080
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:11,616
Everybody agreed that post-prohibition was a bad idea once it

2081
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:18,784
And then they still managed to agree on two more amendments before they could agree on repealing prohibition

2082
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:25,184
We couldn't get a half an amendment passed through now no probably not the only one I would guarantee

2083
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,000
Absolutely repeal prohibition

2084
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
Open today

2085
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
I bet we could

2086
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,632
I would take that back

2087
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,424
You might be right you might be right

2088
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,008
Like I said

2089
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
S*******

2090
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
Dumb dumb

2091
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,104
Repeat that

2092
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:46,176
I will rely will double down

2093
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
The same standard was

2094
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,224
Applied

2095
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
Do axios

2096
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,016
That was applied to you

2097
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,552
They could be sued in the bank

2098
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,600
MC tomorrow by running a headline that says

2099
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
Does the new it

2100
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,160
Questions whether or not there's a

2101
01:43:56,416 --> 01:44:00,000
School shooting cover up to be clear they didn't limit this case

2102
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,280
ISTA just one or two

2103
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
They said any state

2104
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,376
Questioning anything

2105
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,144
Concerning

2106
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
The Sandy Hook

2107
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
Narrative

2108
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Did a death penalty

2109
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,264
They gave you a death penalty

2110
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
In the default

2111
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,104
Midstate then gave you another and they asked for a death

2112
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,408
From the jury in the punitive

2113
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:22,016
Barnes has a total s*** head in a liar but he doesn't actually believe what

2114
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,856
He saying he's also not so dumb as to be unaware that what

2115
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,880
Are you saying is a lie

2116
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Obvious

2117
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:34,560
This case absolutely did not include any supposition the questioning aspects of public events constituted FM

2118
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:41,472
The reason that it might appear that way if you're not paying attention is because the plaintiffs attorneys brought up a ton of instances of Alex

2119
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,264
Repeating and defending talking points

2120
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
That he had used to argue that the shooting never happened

2121
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:49,664
Long after he claims he stopped arguing that it didn't happen

2122
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,992
In fact I was repeating those claims in the middle of his supposed to

2123
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
Apology video

2124
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,928
Imagine this scenario using one of Alex's bulshit claims from the Sandy Hook times which he got from how they Confessor and Cat

2125
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,744
Continue to repeat long after supposedly realizing

2126
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:04,768
The shooting happen

2127
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:08,608
Imagine uconline the people are claiming that the school wasn't

2128
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,376
Even open

2129
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:13,728
And there was no internet traffic to the school's website in the year before the shooting

2130
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:18,848
You'd be totally free to discuss this claim that people were making online and hopefully

2131
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:22,176
You have the decency to take like 5 minutes to look into it and see that it

2132
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,712
Bulshit before going on air

2133
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,504
In mindlessly repeating the claim

2134
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:29,600
But even so if you repeated as a question the folks have you aren't

2135
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
Committing defamation

2136
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,928
This isn't what Alex did

2137
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,584
He use these alleged anomalies as a pile of evidence that he would drop on the audience to support his claim that the shooting didn't

2138
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,632
When the plaintiffs attorneys

2139
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:45,728
It would demonstrate that he was still making these claims in the fairly recent past

2140
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:49,312
What they're doing is illustrating that he's still making the same

2141
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,616
Deconstruct this a little bit

2142
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,176
Alex is making the argument

2143
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:57,760
If the school's website. No traffic then the school wasn't

2144
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,528
Open

2145
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,368
If the school wasn't open to school the shooting could not have happened

2146
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
Therefore the shooting did

2147
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:04,928
Inhabit

2148
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,744
It's essentially a setup of a faith and be

2149
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,024
If B then C

2150
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,304
A therefore C

2151
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,120
It's a perfectly fine construction for an

2152
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,168
It's called a hypothetical syllogism

2153
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:20,032
And assuming all your promises are correct it follows that your conclusion will be as well

2154
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:26,688
When Alex has made the argument repeatedly on the show the audience understands that a is proof of

2155
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:29,248
See whether or not they understand this logic

2156
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Check path

2157
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:35,392
So when Alex is claiming he believes the shooting happened but then still insisting the premise a is correct

2158
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:39,488
What he's doing is still affirming the conclusion while pretending that he's not

2159
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,560
This is one of the ways that Alex has his cake and

2160
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,864
Kinney's at 2 or as Marcus edited

2161
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,912
In the trial he wants it always

2162
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,544
If you pay attention to his show you'll see a bit of this behavior and in the case of Sandy Hook you can plug in a bunch

2163
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
Different narratives

2164
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,640
In that place for premise egg and it works the same

2165
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:02,528
Paramedics weren't allowed in the building kids walked around in circles FBI crime stats say no murders

2166
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,064
Happened in Newtown that year

2167
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,392
All of these things are the first premises

2168
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,440
For that hypothetical syllogism structure

2169
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,232
Barnes understand

2170
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:14,816
This sublevel Alex does tube

2171
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,608
Alex's actions as it relates

2172
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,680
The Sandy Hook are so much worse than just making claims public

2173
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:26,592
His promotion of Wolfgang halbig after the point where he could be reasonably expected to know that Wolfgang was

2174
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,872
Harassing victim

2175
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,896
Family members

2176
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
Including Scarlett Lewis

2177
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:33,760
It's something that you might notice Barnes doesn't even touch

2178
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,808
The defense of Alex's grants

2179
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:38,112
And that grandstanding only works

2180
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
If you have a straw ban version

2181
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
Of the accusation that you need to defend

2182
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,208
Add yourself against

2183
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,232
Hey Barnes

2184
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
Knows all this

2185
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,304
Total s*******

2186
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:48,608
Yeah it reminds me of my favorite

2187
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,888
Moment in the trial

2188
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
Was when

2189
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,776
I believe rain always questioning and then there was this

2190
01:47:56,032 --> 01:48:02,176
Massive objection storm because his questioning was really really terrible and obviously against the rules and stuff

2191
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,968
So the judge shut them down

2192
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,272
And then they have to have a sidebar in right now

2193
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,040
Afterwards

2194
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
It's claims he's like

2195
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
Here's the problem

2196
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:11,392
This is a sanction by the court

2197
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,184
Because they made us look dumb

2198
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,000
And then the judge said the only you can

2199
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:16,768
Do that

2200
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:17,536
And

2201
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,608
That is exactly how I feel about Barnes right now he's like

2202
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,400
The court is doing all of this stuff

2203
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,216
Record is doing his only you make yourself look dumb

2204
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
That's what happen

2205
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,520
You are the one

2206
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,848
A sound a little desperate

2207
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:34,688
To do you making yourself sound a little desperate by way of

2208
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,992
How much this is Justin in Fillmore

2209
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:38,784
I'm quite frankly

2210
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Brazilian

2211
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,928
But they're like okay we'll just

2212
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,464
Oblivion

2213
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
A little extra

2214
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
Support but not

2215
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,352
Becomes evident where we actually do start

2216
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,120
Shutting down

2217
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,912
What a lot of support and then we'll

2218
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
Organizing

2219
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Do something but

2220
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,984
Now's the Time

2221
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,032
Because this is

2222
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,824
Keep simple words alive on a monthly

2223
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
The pays all the salaries

2224
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,712
I don't understand why you still doing commercials while they're planning to sue him allegedly

2225
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,064
Are trying to do understand it's all.

2226
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:16,672
Anyway the conversation of Alex's phone

2227
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,952
Comes up

2228
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,280
And there is a

2229
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:27,680
That's being played here about the idea that their intimate photos there's a little defense

2230
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,448
Defensive

2231
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,752
These people with their

2232
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:31,776
Anymore

2233
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,056
It's on

2234
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
Your email to have the phone and

2235
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,872
Contacts

2236
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,664
Be going over to Moscow

2237
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
Sooner whatever

2238
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,272
Let's talk about that

2239
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
Six months of my phone

2240
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
2019

2241
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
She packs.

2242
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,464
And it's pictures

2243
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,232
My wife and me

2244
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,304
I gave

2245
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
Do phones

2246
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
They were searching

2247
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,704
And

2248
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:01,984
The paralegal

2249
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:03,264
Netflix

2250
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,032
6 months

2251
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,592
We all went through it there's nothing there

2252
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
Nothing wrong anyway

2253
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
And

2254
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
Please like we have two years

2255
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,224
We have the whole phone

2256
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,040
Like they have underbites laptop

2257
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,440
There wasn't photo I said

2258
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:24,768
So

2259
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,840
Wow

2260
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,120
There's one naked picture

2261
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,656
So

2262
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
That's what they got

2263
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
And

2264
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,008
No dick pics donut

2265
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
This is uncomfortable

2266
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,640
Super Bowl

2267
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,176
I wouldn't

2268
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:46,784
Put this out

2269
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,672
Let Mark tell people that you're a shity person on top of a monster I will say this with absolute certain

2270
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,280
Nobody who has access to that phone

2271
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,560
That I'm aware of

2272
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,584
Wood

2273
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
Ever

2274
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Release naked pic

2275
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,168
Even if

2276
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,960
It's like a dick pic of Alex's

2277
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,008
They could hypothetically be on foot

2278
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,032
Like that is

2279
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,592
So uncalled for an

2280
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,896
No I mean it's like Alex could

2281
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,968
Just not say anything at this would never

2282
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:19,296
Be an issue morally it is a horrific thing to do

2283
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:22,880
Yeah and a picture of somebody that's not

2284
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:29,280
Somebody else is adding information to this that is making it quite odd that part

2285
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:34,400
Hey you could have said it and then you didn't have to add the part where you're saying I sent it to a third party

2286
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,168
Without

2287
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:41,824
Well he's trying to say I don't know I don't know cuz Alex is trying to say that he just sent a naked picture

2288
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,104
His wife to his wife

2289
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
I think

2290
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,664
If you follow what he saying

2291
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
Yeah but I think

2292
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,760
I don't know about Mark told the real version

2293
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:54,112
I don't know we'll see will I mean

2294
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:57,440
We will never see this end

2295
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,976
And thank God for that

2296
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,280
Because honestly more importantly is

2297
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,816
Like the stuff that means up

2298
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:06,144
Like the Paul Joseph Watson text it was

2299
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,960
Absolutely

2300
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,520
Barnes and Alex intentionally missed the point

2301
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,312
Yeah it was more fake news

2302
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
And it's a in attempt

2303
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
Extraordinary

2304
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:16,896
They got to

2305
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:18,176
NCA microscopic

2306
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,712
Up close view of Infowars in LA

2307
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,480
Alex Jones

2308
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,528
Any incriminatory

2309
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,088
Formation that's why they got one text message about Paul

2310
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,440
And he is exactly what had nothing to do with

2311
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:32,512
We have your phone

2312
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,840
Blue skies there's no base

2313
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
Criminal case

2314
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,144
Whatsoever there's nope

2315
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,424
Perjury there's no lie

2316
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:43,776
There's two things the first is that that text from Paul illustrates

2317
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,080
That Alex has awareness

2318
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:50,176
The story that he was doing about covid

2319
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,456
Was bulshit

2320
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,760
And it was Sandy Hook all over again

2321
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:58,368
And Alex admitted I get it I understand that this is what we're doing and I don't care

2322
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,392
Yep we're doing this

2323
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,464
The second thing is that the

2324
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,000
Existence of this tax

2325
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,792
Is full evidence

2326
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:11,168
Commit perjury when he said that he had looked through his phone and turned over everything

2327
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,960
That have the word Sandy Hook

2328
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:16,032
And that because you was not turned over

2329
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
That is

2330
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,944
Call Sandy Hook

2331
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,504
Yeah he's correct those words were there

2332
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,040
Lots of that

2333
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,576
It's an issue you're in hot water

2334
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:34,976
If you if those words were in there and you search your phone you would have found that text and you was specifically chose not to

2335
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:39,840
Just one of the great legal minds of Infowars

2336
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,632
It's very clear from disappearing

2337
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:48,032
That is true great legal mind could come up with an argument like this about why everything on out

2338
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,568
Alex's phone is totally cool

2339
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
Animatronic

2340
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
Rodger Stone tattoo

2341
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,152
It's like Rodger

2342
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:54,176
Saying yeah my wife

2343
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:54,944
I fell and broke

2344
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:55,712
Flags

2345
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,736
Gotit are they

2346
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
Sorry man

2347
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:04,160
I mean all of us just one Fitness

2348
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,440
If there was anything there

2349
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:09,536
It would be on the front page of seeing in the New York Times never will do it already been fully

2350
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,816
Disclose and reveal and release

2351
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,096
Is there isn't anything

2352
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
It's like Trump

2353
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:15,936
Do they get to do a macroscopic microscopic

2354
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
Take a look at your in

2355
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,472
Entire life

2356
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,008
And all they can come up with

2357
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
Is pretty much nothing

2358
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,568
Such bad reasoning

2359
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,872
The fact that there isn't

2360
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:28,224
Anything that's been revealed beans there's nothing to reveal

2361
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,272
I mean I guess

2362
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:32,064
That works now but

2363
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:35,392
That may not work eventually I mean is argument

2364
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,440
Unfortunately

2365
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:39,488
The way he put it

2366
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
It is essentially

2367
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:47,168
You know I didn't get caught robbing that bank so I didn't read that back yet I haven't been arrested

2368
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:51,008
I knew I'd robbed the bank then they would have arrested a guy

2369
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,288
Yeah

2370
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:58,688
So legal mind not to not to like be outdone by Alex accusing everyone of being petted

2371
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,480
File

2372
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,504
Besides getting the mix

2373
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:07,392
The Fever by implication

2374
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,160
Of being petty

2375
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,720
Take a note

2376
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:14,304
Fontaine

2377
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,864
And that is why I've been saying that what the

2378
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,144
Heading towards

2379
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,936
Is there going to be a large

2380
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:20,704
Set

2381
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,728
The planets

2382
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:23,776
Courts of info

2383
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,080
And over the course of

2384
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
The process that can

2385
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,128
Very very day

2386
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
Because there's going to be a new level

2387
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,224
A financial

2388
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,016
And if

2389
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,296
You know

2390
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,832
Some lawyer like me

2391
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,880
Basically find out that he's hiding the keys

2392
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,648
The candy store

2393
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,440
Pulled out in front of them understand

2394
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,976
I Can Only Imagine

2395
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,304
So yeah it's going to get in

2396
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:49,888
They think Infowars

2397
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,424
Candy store

2398
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704
What you eating

2399
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,568
Is that

2400
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,616
You Shana Finance

2401
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,432
Either drilling dry well

2402
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:05,760
Projectors.

2403
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,064
What what do you make of this

2404
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
Till I mean I think

2405
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,696
His eyes lit up

2406
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,488
I don't want to know why

2407
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:19,328
Wow

2408
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:20,864
For somebody who got his ass

2409
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,632
White

2410
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:22,912
Bye

2411
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:27,264
Mark in every possible way whenever he was involved legally

2412
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:35,456
It is a lot easier to make fun of him when you're on a talk show and he's not anywhere near you

2413
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:37,504
Confession by project

2414
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:43,904
Another one you should write down that's another it's like the blank and blank

2415
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:51,840
So Alex makes a really good point Kira about some of Mark's,

2416
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:56,704
We have a bunch of plaintiff

2417
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,984
They're going to be splitting up

2418
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,264
The corpse of Infowars

2419
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,824
Alex makes a great Point here

2420
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,384
Mixed feelings about it

2421
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:07,456
So that's the thing if I wanted my enemies to fight

2422
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Acme

2423
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,040
I would say I will just

2424
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
You you're over

2425
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,344
I'm going to dominate

2426
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,136
Like when you said that

2427
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,928
Don't they know what

2428
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,952
What they're doing like

2429
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,488
Do they not know the gold

2430
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,512
With our audience

2431
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,304
I'm saying we're going to cut up his

2432
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
Corpse

2433
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,096
We're going to we're going to

2434
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,400
We're going to shut all these America

2435
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:29,216
Literally just declared war

2436
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,032
The middle class in America

2437
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,312
Completely

2438
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,616
What Alex is saying here can be translated as

2439
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:40,224
Don't these people understand how much I'm going to be able to fundraise off a quote like that

2440
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:42,528
I was just business model operates off

2441
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:46,368
Fear and he's able to monetize his ability to capture the audience

2442
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
Cinestate

2443
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:47,904
Kefir

2444
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,952
When there is a statement like Mark switch

2445
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,256
Can be translated as a direct attack on Alex

2446
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,024
Alex

2447
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:57,376
Repackage that as an attack on the audience which will allow him to more easily fleece

2448
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:00,448
Some of them are continuing to throw money into the pit that is in

2449
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,216
Infowars

2450
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:04,032
Alex is laughing because he feels that Mark

2451
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:08,128
Has made his job of raising money easier but there's a larger reality that Alex

2452
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,968
He's trying to distract away from which is that no matter what he does

2453
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:14,528
There's a Sword of Damocles hanging over his head

2454
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,832
All the posturing in fundraising

2455
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,136
Isn't really going to matter much to a bankruptcy

2456
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:23,744
The audit what do you step into that Arena it's not a civil matter if you try to play games

2457
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,792
You could end up going to jail

2458
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,584
For the sort of crimes you end up pulling

2459
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,936
Consider what could come with a very clear cases

2460
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:35,008
The perjury that Alex was caught committing in the course of the trial

2461
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:38,592
I don't know any of the specifics but I wouldn't be surprised if that was something that could lead to

2462
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,640
Huge fines or possibly

2463
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,432
Even be referred for prosecution

2464
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:46,016
Alex could do this song and dance with Barnes all they want in it

2465
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:49,088
Fun for him to pretend he's won this trial but

2466
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:54,976
In order to do that he has to pretend a whole bunch of other problems don't exist and are nipping at his heels

2467
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,000
I guess is

2468
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:56,768
Yeah

2469
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,048
It's a grim picture

2470
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,376
Yeah I mean I don't know how to deal with

2471
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:06,752
Whenever you find out somebody perjured themselves on the stand when they're still on the

2472
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,872
You know like I feel like that's almost a moment where the whole thing should like

2473
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:14,176
Every like the light should turn off

2474
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:19,552
You should be able to run away

2475
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:23,648
There's no way cuz they cannot just be like later on he gets a fine

2476
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:25,184
That cannot be the case

2477
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,208
You can't

2478
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,768
Tell me that I could just go in lie to a judge

2479
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,560
And then pay $1,000

2480
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:36,448
I'm not sure it would be 1,000 but you know what I'm saying like that cannot be okay

2481
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,496
I agree

2482
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,288
I agree but I also think you should be able

2483
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:48,480
Well no no smoke bombs you have to evade

2484
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,248
The court office

2485
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,576
Get out

2486
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:58,976
You got to come back to this American Gladiator make it through the whole then you win

2487
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:05,120
Thunder a holder whatever the f***

2488
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,424
Turbo

2489
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,312
Go to the Texas Supreme Court maybe the US Supreme Court

2490
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:15,360
And he had some really fun ways of a

2491
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:18,176
Expressing how close they are to winning case like that

2492
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,224
The bondable judgement

2493
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:20,992
Go to the Texas

2494
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,040
Will be decided by them it's a

2495
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,064
Enterprise

2496
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,832
Access Industries

2497
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,368
Gets involved

2498
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,136
Game over for the plane

2499
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,160
Pedro Optical

2500
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,696
Entirely

2501
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Half-up

2502
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:33,280
We're one short a half holy ones Justice

2503
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,816
Just short of them taking it in

2504
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,584
And throwing this out

2505
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:37,120
The very beginning

2506
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,400
Because the very nature

2507
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
Violates the

2508
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:43,008
Always have

2509
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:43,776
Has also violate

2510
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,568
On the definition of

2511
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:51,712
Oh man that's really fun way to say you lost

2512
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:52,992
Wow

2513
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:58,368
I'll be like what are you going to like do you think you're not going to still be one Justice short of half

2514
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,392
Do you think I could

2515
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,416
Have you changed

2516
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:03,744
The Supreme Court of Texas

2517
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:06,304
They'll get that just too short of half

2518
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,608
Because they're not remembering

2519
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:11,424
That they're still despite them being conservative

2520
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:17,056
The Texas Supreme Court or whatever

2521
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,616
These people are still lawyers and judges

2522
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:23,456
Cousin Chet you know true and I imagine that when they start looking at

2523
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:27,040
Somebody abusing the court system the way Alex did

2524
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:30,368
Even though they're like olives Rob Glick Trump

2525
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Speed

2526
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:34,464
They're still give me like we got to take that this guy can't be doing that s***

2527
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:38,048
View the entirety of the case you'll

2528
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,608
Like that you're might be like well we got to take this

2529
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,912
Is perjury stuff a little more seriously

2530
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,984
Could backfire

2531
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,008
Baby. I don't know

2532
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:50,336
The end of this special report

2533
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
It's mostly just

2534
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,408
Rambling about how

2535
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:59,808
It's just the same s*** yeah over and over Garren over I want spiders

2536
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,856
That was great that was funny.

2537
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:04,928
You could grasp something with the spider just were there

2538
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,976
Yeah whose idea was that

2539
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:09,024
Weirdo it Rice University

2540
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:15,168
It's a question that I don't think anybody explain fully to me

2541
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:20,032
Nobody saying that was watching the video of the lady who is like as a grad student who was working on it.

2542
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:25,920
We thought it would be able to do it in me to put the needle into work the first time

2543
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,944
Cool

2544
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:35,392
I was doing the other day and

2545
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:38,208
Spiders kind of look like a man

2546
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,744
Okay

2547
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,328
Alright alright okay okay so we're coming to the end of this

2548
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,864
And of course we're going to have

2549
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,888
How to dismount on

2550
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,656
Some

2551
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,936
Salesmanship

2552
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,496
But also

2553
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:52,544
You got understand that Alex is a hero

2554
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,592
I don't know if that's true it is

2555
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,944
Clear Lake

2556
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
If you buy the product

2557
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:01,504
The word yes

2558
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
Will be shot down

2559
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:05,600
It's not of this

2560
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,928
Sjw judges hands not the Hillary Clinton's hands

2561
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,208
It's not in Satan

2562
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,000
God helps those that help them

2563
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,536
Shelf

2564
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Your hands

2565
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,072
Helping

2566
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,400
I'm going to fight a hundred percent

2567
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,960
Do the best job I can

2568
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,752
But if you take me out of the game

2569
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,056
Time for me to get off the field we've had

2570
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,592
Nothing

2571
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
NFL quarterback radio

2572
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,200
But I

2573
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,480
Can't because this isn't

2574
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:34,272
Our children's future

2575
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,552
I'm telling you

2576
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
I will never give up

2577
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:38,624
But if you don't back us

2578
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,672
And if you don't get out serious this is

2579
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:41,696
Your neck

2580
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:42,720
So I

2581
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,512
I can't quit and I will not quit

2582
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:46,304
But if you quit

2583
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,120
I have no power

2584
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:52,192
This is such a weird abuse

2585
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:52,960
Listen

2586
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:59,616
I will never quit but if you quit I've already quit so that's his no situation so I will never quit fighting

2587
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:03,200
Are you f****** hero for the children and I will never quit

2588
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:05,504
If it does, but I do quit it's your

2589
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:11,904
Listen there's nothing I can do I would love to I would love to not quit but

2590
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:15,232
I don't have a hundreds of millions of dollars will

2591
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:21,632
Never quit and if you stop paying me I'm done and it's your fault can you imagine the kids will all die

2592
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:26,496
You imagine a sadder person than the one who is like I will fight my

2593
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:28,032
Holy Crusade

2594
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,104
As long as I get a good salary

2595
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:35,456
Like a person is dead

2596
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,504
That is the sad version

2597
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,808
Okay

2598
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:41,088
God bless you all

2599
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,624
Thank you for tuning in

2600
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,648
Cher

2601
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
The live feed of this

2602
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,208
Cher

2603
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,000
We are Tyler

2604
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,560
Or roll over to die

2605
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
I know you're not go

2606
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,632
Either

2607
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,912
And I pledge do you all

2608
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,448
I'm going to redouble my efforts

2609
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,752
That took a turn

2610
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:03,616
Got to have that but yes

2611
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:04,640
Die

2612
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:05,920
Man

2613
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,968
Boys

2614
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:09,248
I can't imagine

2615
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,528
Like watching The View be like

2616
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,808
Everyone must see this

2617
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,832
It's.

2618
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,904
It's not really even a response to the

2619
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:18,208
The news of the

2620
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:18,976
No

2621
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:19,744
No

2622
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,792
Doesn't clear anything up

2623
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:26,912
It makes things as confusing as possible and then says will get them in the Supreme Court

2624
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,936
You said

2625
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:31,008
One short of half

2626
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,592
Over and over and over again we're going to Susie's

2627
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,128
These people and we're going to win

2628
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:38,432
And they never Sue anybody

2629
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:41,760
Why would you believe that they're going to win in the Supreme Court

2630
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:47,904
Even paying for the lawsuit this time they don't have it

2631
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:51,744
Yeah after that whole pageant that Alex did about like

2632
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,144
Really respecting Neil and Scarlett and like I'm wanting to support them and all this right

2633
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:58,912
Drag this out Eva

2634
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:02,240
Further

2635
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
Anyway

2636
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,568
We have reached

2637
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:07,616
What I will call the end of my patience

2638
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:13,760
Tensor the trial cover

2639
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,040
And

2640
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:17,856
Yeah it's been it's been something else

2641
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,648
I'm glad

2642
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,696
Has closed

2643
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,464
The chapter

2644
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:26,048
And and I hope you have a good trip

2645
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,584
But we have a lot to

2646
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,120
Get to it and you get back

2647
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:31,424
Right now I mean this

2648
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,752
He's been looking on Twitter as we're recording us

2649
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,032
Via the war

2650
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,312
For trumps

2651
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,848
The search

2652
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
No they released it

2653
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:45,504
I think it leaks and was released

2654
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:51,392
There's a lot man enjoy Ireland but at the same time now I understand

2655
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:56,512
Be conscious of the fact that chaos is brewing

2656
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,048

I don't know if that's even Irish

2662
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:12,128
What's your name what's your character's name again

2663
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:18,528
I'm not going to keep that moniker though the craziest

2664
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,600
Few weeks yeah I think either of our lives

2665
