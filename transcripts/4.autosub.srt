Tucker Carlson

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,536

To go to the emerald Castle

66
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,456
I feel like total didn't have as much agency in that sorry if you think

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,136
I want to be clear

68
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
I respect the s*** out of this and I do believe what you say

69
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,304
I don't believe that at all you don't believe that he doesn't want to be on Fox

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
No I believe that

71
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
I believe that that VP

72
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
Was if not talking about Alex Jones

73
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Himself

74
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
Some person in the Alex Jones

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
Made an inquiry with the VP

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Hey Alex and I maybe Alex because Alex just

77
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Had the

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
Exact same tone of voice that a f****** a******

79
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
She told me the truth

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
You're ugly dude

81
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,519
It's from all of my listening to him he's been wildly

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Consistent

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
There's a part of me that kind of believes him

84
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
That job

85
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Fox News

86
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Have someone over there s*** on

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
I kind of believe him on this one

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:43,135
Italy

89
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
I'm going to

90
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,767
And and you're right you have way more

91
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
But just

92
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Just going on tone

93
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Those guys

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Exactly the

95
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Every one of those guys said

96
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Says the same tone of voice

97
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Like it's all the same

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
And yet every little ass

99
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Like that is

100
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
That is the first time where I've Act

101
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
We thought he wasn't

102
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,527
Just like

103
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
Conspiracy theory

104
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Deceiving

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Genuinely hate

106
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
With all my heart

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
After hearing him say

108
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
I have my own audience

109
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
It's huge

110
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Just like garage has his own audience

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
I'm trying to build something else

112
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
We've done it

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
We've been successful

114
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,359
Donald Trump rally a third of the shirts are infowars.com

115
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
Hillary for prison shirts

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Little bit of

117
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,951
Research on this implying that his dick was the same size

118
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
His audience parallels Almighty

119
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Speculation

120
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
So I looked into

121
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Lock Hillary up underwear

122
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Cuz that would be

123
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Solid

124
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Solid or likes

125
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
Really and cops

126
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Sex play

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Conservative base

128
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
But so I had to do some digging

129
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,415
And I looked into heavy the ultimate white elephant

130
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Got him so mad Christmas is already over

131
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
So I did some research is going to be

132
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
How to get like a store together

133
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
We've got to get

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,311
We've got to put together Alex Jones drop digital dropbox

135
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Hillary up freely handcuffs

136
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
We're going to be we're going to crush it

137
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
So I looked into

138
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
Already gone over that he has like

139
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Maybe about 3 4

140
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
Thousand

141
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Bricks to the website

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Talks about all the station

143
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Buddy's on

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
You talk about the terrestrial Broadcasting

145
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
Little bit of research into that

146
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,471
Jimmy like

147
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
Listing from the communication

148
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
At work that a listing of the 83 station

149
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
Alex Jones is broadcast on

150
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
Any broadcast on Sundays alone on 35 station

151
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
But most of that is overlap

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
Like the Sunday broadcast overlap with the 83

153
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
It's not a hundred percent but there's a lot of

154
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
I was looking

155
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
But if that's not that matter

156
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Get some comparisons handy has at least 424 stations Glen because three

157

Rush as531

160
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
He's at the bottom of that list

161
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
A little bit further

162
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
What are these station

163
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511

36 out of the 83 stations at

183
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
That's 43% of the markets are not even ranked

184
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
In terms of broadcast mark

185
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Wow

186
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
3% or below the threshold where they would even make

187
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
The consideration of ranking

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:57,087
Write 19 out of the 83 that's 22% are in the top 100 mark

22% in the top hundred

193
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
There's a market in Yorkie has a Chicago affiliate

194
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
3 in the nation

195
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Okay only 26

196
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
Out of the 83 including that 19

197
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
The top 100

198
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
To bring them together to

199
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
Total 31% of the top 150

200
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Okay if you keep going down

201
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
You see that's like a lot of these are bad muscles

202
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
Before I say any

203
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,007
Yeah cuz we have like maybe a hundred listeners zero about radio

204
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
If he's in there

205
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
2000

206
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Market

207
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Does that just mean

208
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
That only those

209
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
People can

210
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,343
Get the signal or of the stations

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Right

212
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
But I mean like

213
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
If if we're talking about a city of

214
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
2000 I'm assuming it's not right now

215
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Next to a city of three

216
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
It's it's kind of out there in a

217
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
In the doctor

218
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
We could probably still pick up the station for

219
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
No number Mi outside of house

220
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
But really we're looking at a small percentage of those two

221
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
2000 people

222
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Are actually listen

223
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,063
Baby Alive well it's 2000

224
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,463
I'm saying that not because I think it's that's a shity audience I would love to

225
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,887
If you look at it it's compiled it's coupled with garbage

226
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Ballpark

227
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,775
We've got three station

228
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
Super small Marcus for most of them

229
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Probably

230
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
But still if you're only getting

231
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
Like 300,000 hits

232
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Your website

233
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
What's has a

234
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
Total consistent audience of maybe like 200,000

235
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
I was being

236
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Going to say that's super generous

237
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Clicking on a website versus X

238
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Difference between listening and just

239
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,431
You know what I would actually say his audience is

240
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Closer to 6

241
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
60000

242
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
And most of those are long road

243
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
Entirely possible my heart especially cuz you can smart

244
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
Okay I think I think that you'd probably if you include YouTube in there too I think he has a bigger audience

245
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
Like

246
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
I mean it

247
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
Monetizing YouTube incredibly difficult it is not very high to give like 20,000 hits on a bit

248
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
You're not making much

249
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
If so is that what is average

250
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,479
Kind of videos

251
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
As well on YouTube or do they pay

252
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Pick the eclipse out

253
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
And then put them up

254
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
The ladder but also the prior

255
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Okay but I watched it live

256
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
A couple times and it's like

257
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
600 people are watching

258
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
So not many people are streaming it live on YouTube

259
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Panda listen for

260
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
3 hours not doing anything at work

261
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
If your

262
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,127
Nothing else going on or if you want

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Just on a long road

264
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
You might list

265
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Listen to that whole thing

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
But that's all

267
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
That's also kind of like

268
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
The Conan show really

269
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
Where is my brother

270
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Conan

271
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Michelle from

272
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
For the whole hour and a

273
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
People who want to

274
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,839
But most of us are watching

275
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
5-minute clips

276
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,423
That's possible to get ratings

277
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Yakima

278
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Walking low

279
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
What's going on there

280
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
I was able to dig up

281
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
His country

282
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
That he gives to affiliate

283
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
And I know it's real

284
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
Because it posted on infowars.com

285
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
It is publicly available

286
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,023
Give me more information

287
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
It turns out

288
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
That

289
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Infowars itself is owned by a parent company

290
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,959
Recalled Free Speech Systems LLC

291
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Okay okay

292
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
And I

293
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Yes

294
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Pure think sounds like

295
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
A lot more

296
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Alarm for scrub

297
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
The first thing that I noticed

298
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
About this contract was

299
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
A very clear

300
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
Specification

301
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
Broadcasting Infowars as an affiliate

302
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
They don't charge you any

303
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
And I quote

304
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,335
The Alex Jones Show overdrive in Infowars nightly tuzar free-to-air

305
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
There is no cost for running the program

306
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
No affiliates

307
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
That's in the country

308
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Now here's what they at

309
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Free speech

310
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
System

311
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,719
Reserves the usage of three minutes per broadcast hour for Network promotional advertisers

312
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,327
The broadcaster live usage of the remainder of the scheduled advertising per program

313
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Okay so the

314
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
If you run his show

315
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
Then the network Iran can only ever

316
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Advertise the network

317
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
For 3 minutes

318
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Snow

319
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
You got a flip

320
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Oh I got it

321
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
So let's say I have a radio station

322
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
I want to broadcast Alex Jones

323
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Yes

324
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,527
There's 15 minutes of commercials per hour

325
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
I get 12

326
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
He gets three

327
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Okay

328
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
That is

329
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
Not a great content

330
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
That's really sad

331
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
And only 83 stations have thought to take that take

332
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Reprogramming

333
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Seems like it's a

334
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Well

335
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Toxic is the stuff you saying

336
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,407
The people don't want to put him on their brought there are

337
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:20,575
I find this fascinating and I only had one clip so far

338
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
Available

339
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,999
If you just search for Infowars affiliate contract it'll come up on Google

340
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Which I mean

341
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
Really screws up their negotiating we don't want anyting just let us know our pills

342
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
43 minutes coming from that low of a negotiating point

343
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
Yeah that's real trouble right

344
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Okay you have

345
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Network

346
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,503
Broadcast

347
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
Maybe fifty thousand people

348
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Could listen to your station

349
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,671
That's 50,000 people that might here are three minutes of weird pill commercial

350
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
We're doing this anyway

351
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
So weird to leave me to believe that his body

352
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
There is a

353
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
There is a larger we see no evidence of it

354
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
Are We Now descending into conspiracy theory territory water

355
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
I'm thinking there's an anti George Soros globalist what's happening

356
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
What are you doing today sucked up

357
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,207
So here's here's the next

358
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Not his

359
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Screed on the Glenn Beck

360
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,703
Selling more catheters and more diabetic

361
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
You're the past

362
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Where the future

363
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,711
So that's his next stab

364
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Fox News

365
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
General

366
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Most

367
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
That is the most

368
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,559
Inflicted attack that you can possibly make like he's basically saying

369
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
To them like

370
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,007
I'm selling boner pills and prostate medication

371
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
So he's no I know it's insane

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,711
That's like I don't know like you robbed the bank and you have a friend who also robbed a bank

373
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
But I

374
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Some more

375
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Thank God you do research

376
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
You better decide before quantcast

377
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Quadcast

378
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
They do

379
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
They compiled

380
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,887
They compile statistics

381
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
For advertising

382
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191

00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,031
I'm Gordon quantcast 53% of Alex Jones is audience

384
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
Is over the age of 45

385
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
And 78% are over 35

386
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
Only 6% of his audiences

387
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Between the ages of

388
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
18 + 24

389
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
And 12% between 25

390
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
And 34

391
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
Anybody that's not a young audience anybody.

392
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Anybody below its 6%

393
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
6% below 18 which is

394
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Advisable

395
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Inappropriate

396
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
Child abuse

397
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
I also found info

398
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
That they

399
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Put out in order to try and find

400
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:32,575
Could also find by Googling it toasted on infowars.com it's publicly available

401
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,183
It's insane that they just leave the stuff up on their website without blocking it

402
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,791
It's a PDF of like a slick presentation to

403
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:51,263
Is Google

404
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:58,175
And it's all super usable now on how to look

405
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Through there

406
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Here's the breakdown what is the NSA

407
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
McClintock

408
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
Advertising report they claim

409
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
That his audience

410
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
Is 50 Thor untie 43% over the age of 50

411
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
With an additional 35%

412
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Between the ages of 35

413
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
49

414
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
If you look at the quantcast data that

415
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,655
Can matcha

416
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
Because what they did is change the threshold agent

417
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
4

418
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
No based on Van overall trend is exactly

419
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,271
Based on what independent polling and his own press release they we can

420
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
Pretty much rely on those is fairly accurate

421
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Even if you

422
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Look at that

423
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
33%

424
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Is over 50

425
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
That's an old

426
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
F****** audio

427
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Fox News

428
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
The same

429
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,335
So half of the audience is over 63

430
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Still 50 is not

431
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,431
Not that I mean it's 13 years but it's not Far Cry

432
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
What are you trying to say is

433
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:09,855
We are the Next Generation that will grow up I guess that's the only way to

434
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
Here's the part where it's good that I found out earlier that

435
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Free Speech system

436
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
Owns Infowars

437
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
And I found a press release

438
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
I found an advertising pitch

439
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
From Free Speech system

440
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
That is for Infowars

441
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,407
And what they are I looked I found there like sort of business filing

442
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
And it's a austin-based company in the only contact on it

443
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Okay

444
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
He made all the other stuff private

445
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
Get me my eyes are twin

446
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Express package tracking

447
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
Sell advertising on infowars.com

448
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
On the website as opposed to on the radio brought

449
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,495
So the one

450
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
This this one has

451
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Do you want the audio

452
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
This one claims that the audience is thirty percent

453
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Over the age of 50

454
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
And 67% over the age

455
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
235

456
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
In terms of selling radio advertising

457
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,063
Being accurate

458
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Statistics

459
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,672
And his other PDF numbers

460
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Because

461
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
The radio audience

462
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,120
General people who listen to radio or older

463
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
Younger

464
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
Your audience is much younger than

465
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
What it actually is

466
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
You have

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
Completely conflicting numbers

468
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Also they list

469
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
Three ways that

470
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
That you can buy abs

471
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
On the website

472
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
But here's where I'm starting to get like this is

473
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
The f****** scam

474
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Three ways

475
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
The first way you can do as banneret

476
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Just want to block this also super easily

477
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Available

478
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
It's also on

479
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
Posted on their website

480
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Click on one of the

481
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,264
F*****-up thing will get to what's f*****-up

482
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,176
Operate they showed like the placement of where the ads would be cuz they want to be like

483
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
You can get abs

484
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
AC or DC

485
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Second.

486
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Is a banner

487
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
That goes at the

488
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Top of the web

489
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
Website looks like breaking news

490
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
I'm assuming that they just closed there's a conflict of

491
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Chris that right

492
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,680
I also just went to infowars.com today and there is no Banner ad or any

493
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
Play right now

494
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Let's not in play you're really pushing

495
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
I try

496
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
So the Third Way

497
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Is what I think

498
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
Is really f***** up

499
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
And they're super clear about it

500
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Being f***** up

501
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
The Third Way is called

502
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Text blink

503
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
I'm just going to read a quote

504
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
Oh please

505
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
From their advertising material

506
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
These are disguised as news headlines near the top of the breaking news

507
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,448
Disguise verbatim

508
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,544
That's crazy I'm not paraphrasing enel

509
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
They literally say word for word

510
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,432
We will lie to our

511
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Awesome

512
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
News headlines

513
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
At the top of the breaking news or prisonplanet section

514
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
I guaranteed to get massive immediate hit

515
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
Your text app can say anything you like and varies and pricing for characters

516
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Fit right there

517
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,424
Immediate hits leaders in like to go

518
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:42,592
Do we are selling high-end eyes like what I couldn't find any Banner

519
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Ads on it

520
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,736
Maybe maybe all that's right there disguised

521
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Who knows

522
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,368
At this point if you know that that's an advertising strategy they're literally using

523
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:55,904
Everything is sucks

524
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,232
Yeah you don't know what any of these headlines are really

525
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Which fits into their hole

526
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,912
Their whole thing about BuzzFeed all you want to do about a dumb s*** but every time there's something that's

527
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,984
Like paid for countertenor

528
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,592
Sponsored content because otherwise you're being duplicitous a******

529
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,944
Yeah and even if BuzzFeed isn't doing that they're not advertising 2/3

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
Maybe there I've never seen their sales pitch

531
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Just maybe there is

532
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Like

533
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Because I that does sound like

534
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Sleazy ad sales

535
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,512
And it's not it's not outside the realm of possibility that other websites are doing

536
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Yeah I could definitely Steve many disrupt

537
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Although the MoMA

538
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
Yeah like the moment you know that they are willing to do that and then just

539
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
Supply that to even some

540
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Percentage of

541
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Mainstream

542
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
It's like

543
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
Well if these guys

544
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
And they're not hiding maybe they're just

545
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Worst job

546
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Hiding house

547
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,880
There should not have these things be public

548
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,720
They should really not it's really easy to set up page to private

549
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
But even then it does seem like

550
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
There

551
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Viewers would not give a she

552
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,216
Orbi orbi like

553
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
This is fake news

554
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,664
That is the world we live in now where if you disagree with something

555
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Specnaz

556
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
Anyway

557
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
Like some of the summation of the research

558
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
There's one more thing I found

559
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Because he hate

560
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
All these media people

561
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,464
He talks about how he so much better than them

562
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
Right

563
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
Which is another advertising tool for websites

564
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,656
Say nice things about you

565
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:47,008
That's another Alexa this is a website that gives you a rank

566
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,824
It ranks all the websites in the world in terms of traffic

567
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
So most of the top ones are Google

568
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
Different different countries

569
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688

573
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,392
Their Alexa rank is 1300

574
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:07,488
49er really good

575
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,328
My Angel Fire website is not

576
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,984
I'll tell you that right now thing I've ever done is in the top million so I mean I'm not shiting on him

577
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
For what he's achieved

578
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
But when he talks about how huge is audiences and then is like

579
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,152
Bring up Alexa

580
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,736
But he brings up quadcast and Alexa and talks about his dad

581
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,320
He's 1349 I'm going to give you a few websites

582
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,928
And tell you where they are

583
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
What do you think it is

584
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
This is a good guessing

585
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352

CNN

588
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
I would actually

589
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Say they're lower

590
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
Fake news

591
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824

594
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,176

BBC

596
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224

You're going higher as we go along

604
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
I figured out the game

605
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,424
4585

606
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960

607
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752

So let's go with

609
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,200
Let's go with 70

P****** is 51

620
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:01,152
For novice 51 xHamster is not a popular so I'll go 100

Daily Mail I'm 50 off on literally every one of them

626

00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,776
122

632
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Cuz I was going to go

633
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
70s

634
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,944
50 news site called blasting news

638
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,120
That game

639
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
I don't have the number I but I saw it on the list

640
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
This way up there

641
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,800
Behind all of those also his

642
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
Patriot The Drudge Report

643
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
You would think

644
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
No

645
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
It's not what's 629

646
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,016
Therapist

647
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:16,416
Chuchumaa 129th most popular website in the world is pretty crazy

648
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
In the world that I live in

649
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Conservatives

650
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
I guess it should be

651
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,072
Because their voice

652
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
So much louder

653
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
And so different

654
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,912
Seems that they should be

655
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
It seems that they should be so much

656
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
They act like they're so much higher

657
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:35,360
Yeah well that when you take this it's like I'm so much more popular than

658
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,456
CNN's fake news or 13 49

659
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
Yeah it is a big difference

660
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Between those two

661
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
But he's not

662
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
He's speaking to his body

663
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
They're passionate

664
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
CNN readers

665
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
What they make up for

666
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,632
It's the actually talking about Glenn Beck and I were back to

667
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Eclipse

668
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
Search has done all that out

669
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
Oh my God

670
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Is it said about Trump

671
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
And he hosted

672
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,712
He can't wait to see how things go

673
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
This is so sick on many levels

674
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
It's like saying

675
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Roshes green

676
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,512
Digital pink

677
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,816
Of course

678
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
And then again what is this failure

679
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,800
College eaters all over

680
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
ABC CBS NBC

681
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,432
Apologizing for conservative

682
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Apologizing for Donald Trump

683
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,160
Bean recipe

684
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
Is an Insider admits that

685
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Apologizing

686
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
Then he goes on

687
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
It's upstairs

688
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
Ex machina

689
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
Trying to rehabilitate himself hey Kelly

690
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
The class to leave

691
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
Hated her guts

692
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736

Half the nation

710
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,704
No it's way more than half

711
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:13,568
Trump's favorable ratings are like 27

712
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,896
If you what's the

713
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
What's that metric called

714
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Subtractive e+

715
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,344
You know like where you take the favorability against unfavorability

716
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
He's

717
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,160
SuperLotto

718
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
What was it

719
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
Obama whenever he was elected he added

720
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:38,144
+ 70

721
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,616
The he's worried that there will be a coup

722
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
Against Trump and most of the country is like

723
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
I mean

724
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Wanted a third

725
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
Will you saw that in his farewell speech

726
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
Which it which goes so again

727
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,536
Alex Jones's entire narrative

728
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,936
Not for mortgage

729
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Yeah

730
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
2

731
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,312
Everybody should have four more years

732
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
I'm not saying that

733
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,896
But it is to his detriment that he

734
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
Play so soft

735
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Too hard

736
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
America

737
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,832
Here's my Theory on

738
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
On where we are now

739
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
The Siri is this

740
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,488
Because Obama was so reason

741
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
The only way to fight against him

742
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Mix it

743
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
If Obama actually had gone far left

744
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,288
Then the rate would be much more towards the center right

745
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
Now because it'd be much easier to

746
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
Said because Obama was so in the center

747
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
The right

748
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,856
Had to go further and further and further and makes

749
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,000
Yeah like they had to make that up because I couldn't be like well Obama seems like he's pretty reasonable and he's governor

750
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:13,632
Idea consistently made overtures to try and cooperate

751
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
Korbel

752
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Who's going to be the new

753
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Like hacky things

754
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
To say or like

755
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
Someone posted about how I

756
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Hey conservative

757
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Good luck

758
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Cuz you had eight years of the most

759
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
Conciliatory

760
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Polite

761
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,368
Decent trying to work with you president in the world

762
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:36,416
And you are f****** shiting on it

763
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
And now you're going to see what happens

764
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
When liberals don't want to play along

765
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
I think there's something to that

766
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
What I don't

767
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,080
We are on our goal is like

768
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
Hey

769
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
We believe that your pee

770
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
People to

771
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
And their entire goal is

772
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
You're not people

773
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,856
Literally

774
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Demon repeatedly

775
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
So it's not like

776
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
Liberals will still

777
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
Even though you read all those articles worth

778
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Here's why we lost cuz

779
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
Appeal to Middle Americans

780
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,960
We lost because Middle America those those

781
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,312
That's why

782
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,944
Yeah it is straight up you know if bubbles are the Multicultural Center

783
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:35,040
I hate it when you live in your bubble of all the different types

784
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:38,624
Two people together

785
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
So there was too much to cover in this episode so I'm going to do a

786
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,816
Quick rundown of things that could make the cut

787
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Excellent

788
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,472
There was a

789
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
What Geico

790
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,176
Rodger Stone who hosts the show

791
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,504
Had a nice quote about how will Donald Trump

792
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
He's knows he's going to be videotaped

793
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
So these possibly exist meanwhile Billy bush

794
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
Got him on a film set on a f****** film set when he was wearing a microphone like me

795
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
So like that pool logic to me is so crazy they called

796
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,896
Has it Billy bush had any idea

797
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,712
Both of them

798
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
More fun for me

799
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,976
World we live in Alex talk about how free speech is going to end

800
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
And one of the things that he cited was that when they arrested Dinesh D'Souza I knew the game was up

801
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,728
I looked into it 2014 they arrested him

802
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,592
I can see was in illegally donating

803
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,688
To the senatorial campaign of a New York Conservative candidate named Wendy long

804
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,784
So that's when he knew the game was up

805
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,440
So I looked into it and the government charged with illegally

806
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Clean bulbs

807
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,328
Donate $10,000 each to campaign of an old friend from Dartmouth College

808
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
I would be understanding

809
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
He would reimburse them in cash for their contribution

810
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,568
Question they would donate

811
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
About the donations reassuring

812
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
People the people who are donating

813
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,456
Had sufficient funds to make the contribution

814
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,016
Miss Long pressed on the matter

815
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
After the election

816
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
The government said

817
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,208
Told Miss Long not to worry because she had not known about

818
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
So he actually found at this point the only way to break campaign Finance laws

819
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,872
Like that's the most obvious way that like that might as well have been him writing

820
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,200
And I'm willing to disguise my

821
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
On the website

822
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
Ridiculous

823
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,976
His remarks

824
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Constructive is the only way

825
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
Guy from a letter to the court from mr. Susan or Mistresses ex-wife

826
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Dixie D'Souza

827
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,872
Great Neck treatment she said he had a quote character and lack of truthfulness

828
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,920
And accused him of physically abusing her

829
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,808
Now hold on it's not over on his own behalf

830
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
Explain made the illegal donation

831
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
Because he wanted to help Miss Long's floundering campaign

832
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
Quote I could see that personally she was humiliated he said

833
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,072
Mr. D'Souza who came to America alone from India

834
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,376
Teenager described as a member of his quotes

835
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Surrogate family at Dartmouth

836
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
The government argued that Mr d'souza's crime was not a myth

837
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
Misguided actor friendship but

838
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
Premeditated decision to break the campaign Finance

839
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,504
I was doing this

840
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,624
Because I want her to win cuz she was humiliated

841
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,024
Exactly what he did note the pathetic part about it is.

842
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
I wanted to kill that man

843
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
And then

844
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
The Great

845
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
Cool you're free

846
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,616
I didn't realize

847
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,664
Like I care about my family

848
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
My surrogate family

849
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
That's why I did

850
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Lancer

851
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
When it's not

852
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
You're trying to cover Your Tracks

853
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
What episode is a beautiful thing

854
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
It would be more like him throwing her under

855
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
To me to do it

856
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Craven is more like

857
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
He is

858
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Knowingly

859
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,128
Stimulating

860
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Not just a hunch

861
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
Craven is not

862
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,760
Also cut from the comic book

863
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,344
We have to get to what I think is going to be the most important thing that's ever happened

864
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
But the second coming of Christ

865
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,744
But alright

866
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
I can play those clips if you want to hear one

867
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
The sad part is

868
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Almost

869
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
But that was

870
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Just a shortening

871
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
I remembers another gate Trump was

872
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Kid on

873
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
Elijah Craig

874
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,760
Allied allegedly it was a specific

875
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,320
Oh no it is

876
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
A hooker

877
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,416
Probably something I don't I don't think

878
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Is that evidence

879
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
We have proved anyting

880
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
But I also don't think it's outside the realm of possibility

881
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
The most

882
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
Inside the realm of possibility most people who've been covering it had been covering it with the caveat in the sea

883
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Same way the BuzzFeed

884
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
Says with a sponsored content

885
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
I think every article that I've read about it

886
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Has been like

887
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,760
Verified this isn't is not

888
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,296
You're verifying these

889
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
The president was

890
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Was briefed on the

891
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
Which is fair to report you should be reporting that is there

892
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
Keep that as far as the peeing on thing

893
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
I have no problem with him being

894
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
P. Me neither

895
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
And it's not even like

896
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:51,616
Then the sexual exploits of JFK are

897
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,431
Thrown under the rug because that was back whenever peep

898
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
People have the gentlemen's

899
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Agreement look like

900
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,247
Oh we will

901
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
His private business private he was up to and because of decorum they didn't check

902
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,279
Play witches on them

903
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303
Because that's not

904
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,863
That's the that's the salacious thing

905
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
In that

906
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
That everybody

907
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
Like gloms onto

908
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,847
He may be

909
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,127
Being blackmailed

910
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,455
And even if

911
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
Compete on a dog

912
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,575
They're blackmailing

913
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
Perfectly with someone

914
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
What is Candida

915
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
But it could be but let's say it

916
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
Let's like positive world where he's not being blackmailed

917
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,519
Hillary Clinton because of the narrative it's already been set up and because of his axe

918
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
And how ruthless Russia is

919
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
Cancel like

920
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,343
We're in a place now where Russia could come up with anything

921
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,879
And be like

922
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Do what we want or will release

923
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,607
Like you really don't have blackmail now we can make it

924
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:20,959
So far beyond the realm of reality now like that whole fake news thing

925
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Is

926
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,615
For everybody

927
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
Because now there is no legitimate

928
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Legitimacy

929
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
Do any bed oven

930
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Snopes

931
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
I can't believe or not believe

932
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,831
Cuz you're dumb

933
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
I am

934
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Puppy gate stuff

935
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:51,935
His take on it is pretty predictable

936
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,775
I might have to cut this off at some point

937
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
It's pretty pretty

938
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
Vegetable

939
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
Again

940
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Ridiculous

941
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
Usually the multiple story

942
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,135
It's not easily to Buncombe or easily Devon

943
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:17,535
Whatever you want to say about it it's very hard to unverified but

944
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Fleming

945
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
We're going to allow it

946
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:31,103
President Heaven blackmailed by the Russians because they have video of him

947
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
With women urinating on each other I'm sorry to have to talk about that on here but that's what's been putting the news

948
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,903
So this goes back to the decorum thing we're talking about this is Alex Jones's fake decorum

949
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,207
I look dirty dirty stuff

950
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
Children

951
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:53,631
Avoid learning about the world

952
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,983
Is everything turned

953
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
I'm so fat like on Tuesday

954
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
Obama gave a

955
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,175
An uplifting beautiful speech about Unity

956
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,967
Wednesday

957
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Trump deny being

958
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Peed on by hooker

959
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
The world that we live in

960
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
It's amazing

961
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
On Spotify play lighters

962
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,047
There's no way that we could write anything more insane than what's going on right

963
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
If you want to hear about insane

964
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
Look at this juxtaposition of I'm sorry

965
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Talk about

966
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
Now here is next

967
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:35,359
We have to cover it Express and the clintons

968
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
Leotard pedophile net worth

969
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
Is the clintons are clearly involved with the whole Hollywood Elite in a row in a Roman polanski's in the Middle Street

970
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:52,767
Apologize for pedophilia

971
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:58,655
Over and over and over and over

972
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:05,055
So he keeps doing this thing he keeps doing this thing where he's like I don't want to talk about peeing but also

973
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,199
Lansky Lansky bro

974
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
But also everyone in the clintons organization is a pedophile

975
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
Who was a billionaire

976
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,791
Convicted pedophile private plane

977
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
He would take people on vacation

978
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,375
Bill Clinton is in his Rolodex

979
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,703
Coronavirus

980
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,775
Pretty much everybody's prove your f****** kids

981
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,687
I'm going out with some bad when I was younger

982
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
To save the Press

983
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,319
I don't know

984
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,135
And I didn't know but it was also selling guns

985
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,231
My blood

986
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
That sort of thing but like

987
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,815
I did hang out enough guy

988
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
I imagine

989
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,655
Did if I had hung out with a pedophile at some point

990
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
I found out later

991
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,215
I wouldn't be like

992
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
I shouldn't have done that if I didn't know that about them that sucks

993
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,103
I wish I would have known but

994
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
They were

995
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,175
They work f****** kids around me

996
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:19,295
Corollary in our world

997
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
A lot of

998
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
And let's not say a lot

999
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Melissa

1000
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Measurements

1001
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Yeah

1002
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
Comedians are all crazy

1003
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Who are in that

1004
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
I've done some bad ship

1005
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
I didn't know there were always been nice

1006
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,959
Like once I know that

1007
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
That immediately changes

1008
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
This whole thing about the

1009
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Stop music

1010
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
These

1011
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Can we stop

1012
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,599
I'm sorry I know I hate it too I hate it

1013
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
50 years of date

1014
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
Nathan Bill Gates

1015
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Has ever suffered

1016
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,983
He does this whole long thing about how it's the liberals who are into the sexual perversion

1017
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,263
Then he has this

1018
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Send

1019
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Then I think

1020
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
Delicious

1021
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Please enjoy

1022
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Cuz it's all the Liberals are

1023
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,991
Best Philips ards the product they're obsessed

1024
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
Hollywood

1025
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
The f****** kids

1026
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
What's

1027
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
I'll tell you

1028
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
So you're right f****** now

1029
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:34,303
Beautiful perfect

1030
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,727
Picture perfect family

1031
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,799
That's a great

1032
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
I like people

1033
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,431
You can say the most sex

1034
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:56,319
This thing you can think of the least expensive thing about him he's into perfect

1035
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
10 women

1036
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
No it's not a crime

1037
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,951
He's been married

1038
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,167
No his family does have a very children

1039
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,727
And one of them is just completely ignored

1040
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
Tiffany has another daughter that never has just completely ignored

1041
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,271
Scenario

1042
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
No I think she's doing fine but on The Osbournes they had another daughter that wasn't on the real

1043
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
Comedy show

1044
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
Did not want any part of the show

1045
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
I thought you just

1046
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,887
Like the third Olsen

1047
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Because Mary-Kate and Ashley were twins there was another one

1048
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
Isaac but isn't

1049
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,359
Public eye before

1050
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663

1051
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,527

We shall meet at dawn

1053
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Jordans

1054
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Time is come

1055
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
We have to get to

1056
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
I wish I was playing music

1057
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Arthritis

1058
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,839
I don't even want to explain to you what this is

1059
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Okay I just want to start the clip

1060
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,935
And watch your face

1061
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,239
Oh God no because this is going to blow your mind

1062
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
This is something

1063
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
From 2000

1064
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
14

1065
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
Are you picking up what's going on yet

1066
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
He's the Lord a conspiracy

1067
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
Do you understand

1068
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,703
Mario is right now

1069
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
We'll see

1070
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,911
Alex Jones doing stand-up

1071
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
But

1072
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
Do you have any of it

1073
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
No

1074
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
Oh we're gonna

1075
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,575
I'll give you a bit of a run now

1076
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Brought up

1077
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:40,159
To the Lord of conspiracy

1078
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
Broadway show

1079
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
Absolutely

1080
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Dancing

1081
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:50,655
Paranoia it be beautiful if we were going to write an opera

1082
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
That would be the name of this Opera

1083
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
We'd have to do in Italian

1084
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
That's the only way

1085
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
Alex Jones is friends with duck stamp

1086
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,111
The two of them are friends because Doug likes

1087
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
F****** weird

1088
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,463
And when Doug was headlining

1089
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
The

1090
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
Cap City Comedy Club

1091
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
Yeah I did there Open Mic once actually I didn't

1092
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
And

1093
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:33,919
Really really mentally ill people who are doing comedy came up to me and wouldn't leave me alone and so I left

1094
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,063
It was way too uncomfortable

1095
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
Nobody has ever been like man I wish I had left

1096
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,975
When he's down in Austin

1097
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
He's like hey Alex

1098
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Come do a set

1099
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
Bring me up

1100
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:51,839
Stage

1101
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,375
So this is what

1102
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
Now he's started with a but seriously

1103
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
Which is great. I love that

1104
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
Fantastic

1105
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,151
Let's see what he's got.

1106
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,479
Pre pre listen to the clip

1107
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
His chops

1108
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Bar

1109
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,695
Well you know a lot about Bill Hicks

1110
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Faked his own death

1111
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,999
Alex Jones

1112
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
You know that's conspiracy

1113
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,143
Great bet there's a lot of conspiracy about that he's Andy Kaufman as

1114
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:55,583
I want to play the end of that cuz you are laughing you were laughing over this I want you to listen to the audience reaction cuz I think it's in

1115
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
You see how that

1116
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
Tapered out

1117
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,055
There was like a couple of Wu's and then silence

1118
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,895
This I think if we're analyzing this as performers are so

1119
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,455
What happened there when he started yelling

1120
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
Was he was attempting to get into character

1121
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,343
He was trying to get into the Alex Jones persona

1122
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
And he got that

1123
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,415
I realize

1124
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Chewbacca

1125
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
Oh yeah

1126
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Celebrity goes to the neck

1127
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
And by the way I caught out nothing

1128
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,143
All I did was separate the clips

1129
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
This is all of it

1130
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:42,175
The film clip

1131
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Sounds like a

1132
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,903
Mcmillers

1133
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,231
He thought that motherfuker was the last

1134
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,047
Possibly he thought he was doing Dennis Miller

1135
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:03,423
When he was like that call Fidel Castro

1136
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,895
Get it

1137
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,743
Saddam Hussein

1138
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,071
Why you're laughing

1139
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,631
The clip went onto Dead Silence from the audio

1140
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Yeah well that's not a joke

1141
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,239
Not a good fit

1142
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,127
It's not even good public speaking really if you want to take comedy out of it and just like you're giving a lecture

1143
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:20,223
I think that's the problem is

1144
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Realize

1145
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
About halfway

1146
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Through those words

1147
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,343
He doesn't have anywhere to go

1148
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,439
But again that's what I think is

1149
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
B I'm trying to get into

1150
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
He's he's constantly trying to get to that gear

1151
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
But he's

1152
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,143
He's not used to being in front of an audience

1153
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,167
That doesn't give a f***

1154
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
They want to see Doug Stanhope

1155
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
He is an impeachment

1156
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,199
To getting to Stanhope

1157
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
Plenty of

1158
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:57,599
People who are familiar with Alex Jones Maybe

1159
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,647
Who's also a dirtbag

1160
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
That's a good point

1161
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,535
It's possible to here

1162
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
All of the

1163
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,119
What be all these dictators

1164
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,679
Cuz he's in the mix

1165
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:17,311
These dictators that have been put in place by

1166
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Eisenhower

1167
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Call

1168
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,711
El Castro

1169
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
Cuba the Caribbean

1170
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
AdvoCare

1171
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,087
The pirate

1172
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,927
He's actually you know

1173
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
It was a

1174
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Keith Richards

1175
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Fidel Castro

1176
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,047
A hundred percent

1177
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,375
Israeli channels no doubt about that

1178
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:47,775
The score for the movie Danny Elfman

1179
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:54,175
Composer this is me trying to act like I know anything about pop culture I heard a composer is going to be

1180
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Who cares

1181
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,271
Okay so

1182
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
So let's

1183
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
Let's go from just a comedy

1184
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
Point Break

1185
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:06,719
Not great not very very poorly constructed

1186
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,279
I don't think there's really a premise

1187
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,143
I think there's so the premise here there's a premise but not a comedic

1188
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:18,751
But you're building a joke there's nowhere to go but if you

1189
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,287
It's that our leaders

1190
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Keep putting in these dictators

1191
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
And Design

1192
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,175
They fake Wars and I have to watch people die

1193
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
That's the premise

1194
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Does he

1195
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
Does he know he's

1196
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,623
The Comedy Club

1197
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Okay

1198
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,695
Here's a hundred percent

1199
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
I hear Voice or something happen

1200
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,023
Doug Stanhope

1201
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,351
Doesn't really like Alex Jones

1202
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,887
And I think

1203
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
Now and he's

1204
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Let him in

1205
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Situation

1206
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,287
But he knows he's going to fail

1207
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,639
Because it's going to be entertaining to him there is a truth in that

1208
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
To me there is nothing

1209
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Funnier than

1210
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
A comic book

1211
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,527
I went to

1212
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Comedian Bill squire

1213
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Cleveland

1214
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,415
When I was unprepared for it

1215
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,695
He took me on the road with

1216
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
To The Dakotas

1217
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,279
And one-nighters

1218
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,071
And then in

1219
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
Sioux Falls South Dakota we're there for like

1220
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Free night

1221
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
The first night we were there they let me go up

1222
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
Club

1223
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:29,407
And I didn't have the tools I didn't have the skills to do it

1224
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,711
The job so hard

1225
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
And bill went up after me

1226
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
He was like Hey guys

1227
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
You know like the friend of mine

1228
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,111
We drove here from

1229
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Chicago

1230
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
Watching you guys

1231
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Really hate him

1232
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
Was so funny

1233
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,863
And I thought that was hilarious to me like

1234
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,751
Cuz it took but I maintain this that the other side of it

1235
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,287
Mike Wiley is the

1236
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
The funniest writer

1237
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
And there is nothing funny or

1238
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,895
To me then watching Mike Wiley Bob

1239
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:05,247
Mike Wiley is a Chicago comic

1240
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
Who eyes

1241
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,575
Mostly one-liner base

1242
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,391
Tremendous writer chops

1243
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
You can find his

1244
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
CD on iTunes

1245
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
It is yeah I can't remember now

1246
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
Alex does

1247
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,911
Get a little bit of juice

1248
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
In this neck

1249
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
Does asparagus

1250
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:29,567
I don't think so buddy

1251
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
And again I want to

1252
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,615
Be clear I'm not cutting on

1253
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
There's either

1254
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
They're just segments

1255
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,103
Reality

1256
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
That's where you got them

1257
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
They hate prisons

1258
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,711
Everybody Hates Chris

1259
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,039
Especially

1260
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,855
The odds is good

1261
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,671
Bedtime

1262
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Poor poor him

1263
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:25,375
Yeah I like that yelling about rebuilding

1264
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,935
That's a nice visual image but I don't know how to connect

1265
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,239
He's got that you got that feel of like

1266
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Every single where he knows isn't working

1267
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:38,943
So he's starting to get louder and louder as a way to cover it up like

1268
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,783
Oh yeah I can't hear their laughter because I'm shouting

1269
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
I meant things

1270
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Bad

1271
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
Turn the little bit later

1272
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Libby

1273
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
Dissolution

1274
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,951
So this is the thing that Alex talks about all the time on his program

1275
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,839
It's a process that is problem reaction solution

1276
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:33,471
People who are trying to manipulate the world 11

1277
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:38,335
Like George W blow the problem

1278
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Iraq because

1279
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
Is his dad

1280
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,943
Well the problem was they needed more oil

1281
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,271
I'm sorry

1282
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:52,671
The problem is 11 happened

1283
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
Go to war in the solution

1284
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
I don't talk

1285
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,583
Now it's all stupid text realized

1286
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
The idea of false flag

1287
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Is that everyone has this

1288
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,703
All the stuff planned ahead of time

1289
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08,031
This problem

1290
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,335
And then we will offer them the solution

1291
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,407
You create Terror and they will beg us to

1292
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,991
How come out

1293
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,271
Really why

1294
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
They do have that it's not it's not that they cause the Christ

1295
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:23,647
No

1296
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
Do it right

1297
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:31,071
You know what you know what I think likes me out there's no there's no crisis that you can't turn into an opportunity

1298
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:36,703
But not on the same level as

1299
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
But maybe

1300
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,519
Alex would think he is

1301
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,103
Never let a good crisis go to waste

1302
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Is

1303
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Is an unfortunate

1304
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,943
Sentiment

1305
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
It's bad opt

1306
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
To be caught saying it

1307
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
Because it makes it look like you might

1308
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
Set up bad things to happen

1309
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
But they really behind it is

1310
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:01,023
We want to help people and if opportunities arise to do at least

1311
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,095
To do those things

1312
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
Famously

1313
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,679
Was super excited

1314
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,959
Japanese Brown

1315
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
Pearl Harbor

1316
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,311
Because then he can help

1317
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
Which stocks

1318
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,407
It was short

1319
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
Nothing Better Could Happen then the Japanese bombing

1320
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
Pearl Harbor

1321
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
It's in some ways taking too long

1322
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Norbit

1323
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,463
Take me to Longview is always a way to get high

1324
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,047
Very last characters

1325
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,167
People

1326
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,783
Jesus Christ

1327
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
100-percent Doug

1328
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,159
From the back of the room

1329
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,975
Definitely a couple times

1330
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
If I clap

1331
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,535
But when there's

1332
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,303
Clap

1333
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:12,191
I'm pretty sure it's so if it were me in the back of that show it would be him saying something in me gone

1334
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,079
Well I got that you recognize my life I've ever listened to Jimmy Pardo CD

1335
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
Pompous clown

1336
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,711
You can hear Mike Schmidt laughing throughout it when no one else is laughing

1337
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
He gets it

1338
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,015
This is a different

1339
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
But the same result

1340
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
Doug is not laughing

1341
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,671
With Alex

1342
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,975
He's laughing at

1343
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Oh look at you out of your element

1344
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,303
Yeah and I think

1345
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Do you really think

1346
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,631
But if Alex had learned

1347
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
The lesson

1348
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,495
Of the beginning of the set when he tried to get into character and it didn't work

1349
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
If you'd just

1350
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,311
Howard Pruitt

1351
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,127
I think this would go way better than

1352
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,943
Really

1353
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
But because he

1354
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,319
He keeps rattling off backs that no one gives a f*** about

1355
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
It gets

1356
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,159
F****** weird it is such a

1357
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,743
Up and down for his energy on that is

1358
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
Let me tell you about

1359
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,847
You bad dude

1360
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
Yours is next

1361
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,479
I want to pause there really quick as this is another thing that he does

1362
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,015
I all the time as you like

1363
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:08,415
Admit exactly what they want to do in public

1364
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,511
The implication there is

1365
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Read all those

1366
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
I'm smart

1367
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
I'm going to relay this to you

1368
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,167
The second implication

1369
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Is that

1370
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,239
Everybody else

1371
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
Those Publications

1372
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
And he's like

1373
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
Oh yeah

1374
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,943
And they don't tell the people because they are in on this globalist

1375
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
Conspiracy

1376
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
I apologize for going so fast

1377
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Gif

1378
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Anybody

1379
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,959
You text but I mean

1380
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,751
That there is a population

1381
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,639
Everyone knows that everybody knows that any problem realistically if you look at it

1382
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,687
It is more resource allocation

1383
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Yeah we good

1384
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Support

1385
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:10,623
Do more people we just did things a little bit more judicious

1386
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
Nope

1387
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Listen

1388
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Goddamn

1389
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
Faces of every person

1390
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:35,967
No you can't like two of them this is full. So

1391
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,295
Of course it is

1392
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,159
Even though for he was huge

1393
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
Is because there is

1394
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,231
Because there was that huge round of applause

1395
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
No

1396
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Well

1397
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,887
That's a polite Applause the only other time people plotted in math

1398
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
Is when he brought up

1399
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,215
But he was about to bring up

1400
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,495
No I don't notice

1401
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,335
That's what I want

1402
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
People all the time like the

1403
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
The first sentence

1404
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
Oh no

1405
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
And then the phases go

1406
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,319
Blank is someone who sees us

1407
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Kind of Comedy

1408
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
I would love this

1409
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:24,351
The number of bland cookie-cutter open-mic s*** I see

1410
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
Yeah

1411
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
Let's I get a little

1412
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
You still talk about Rockefeller and how he loved me

1413
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
Panda

1414
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,039
300000

1415
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:21,695
Area code 903 number

1416
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:53,695
Noriega

1417
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,167
It's just incredible

1418
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
False Flags

1419
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:09,311
Lake Pleasant kill 1 million people

1420
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:13,407
Missed you that's like it's a little bit of light

1421
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,295
Shenanigans is analogous to putting like firecrackers in someone's mailbox

1422
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
I legitimately think

1423
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:49,247
Because it was so unlike

1424
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Now

1425
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
Here's where she at

1426
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,879
How could she

1427
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Beer

1428
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
Come on

1429
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:09,471
Hit me with that

1430
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,855
So him and telling him to get off stage or tell jokes

1431
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,415
We all hear the wooing of the audience

1432
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,439
People start cheering

1433
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
And that's because Doug

1434
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,999
Has gotten

1435
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,271
You were laughing over it but Doug yells at the audience this is for me assholes which almost confirmed

1436
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
Setting Alex aftertale

1437
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:02,975
And because Alex has no goddamn

1438
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,023
Confidence in the world he keeps being like

1439
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
Are they asked me to do this

1440
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,631
Look it's almost apologizing

1441
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
Impro

1442
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,687
Doug has just walking up there for five seconds, and he's about to do

1443
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
Text God

1444
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,343
But it's also like anybody could have made a good joke

1445
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,879
In that circumstance

1446
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:35,231
He sounds like that was all one bit

1447
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
From Santa

1448
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,791
That he had written this

1449
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:44,191
Years ago

1450
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,007
F****** killer punchline

1451
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,543
Always wanted to do a two-man

1452
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,639
False flag operation

1453
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Gets off stage

1454
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
Alex is a little bit of

1455
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
Stratosphere

1456
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,815
So what's awesome about that

1457
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,655
With the idea that he was going somewhere

1458
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:53,311
That's my point is the best thing that Alex has ever says it a lot but there is no

1459
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
Ever

1460
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
This might be the secret of 2070

1461
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,199
That could be the secret

1462
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,503
God dammit

1463
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,063
What would what is he

1464
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
I want to be in

1465
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,183
What time will you probably

1466
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
Every single time

1467
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,999
I think it's like

1468
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
What is it

1469
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,327
Feel like to I want to crawl inside of his brain

1470
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,167
And just sit there and watch that like the movie Inside Out where you have those

1471
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
Emotions

1472
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,031
It's probably just like anger and then

1473
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Flickering neon light

1474
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:27,615
Just picking anger angry

1475
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,967
I understand clearly I ever I don't think I think there's a lot of

1476
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
I think

1477
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
Hunter jealousy that motive

1478
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,647
Definitely fear

1479
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
Fear is

1480
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Massive motor

1481
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
Do you think

1482
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Afraid

1483
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
I just had

1484
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Sphere

1485
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
That's why

1486
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,775
Afraid or is he projecting that

1487
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
That's what he needs to

1488
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,711
Hard to say

1489
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
In the years that we end up doing the thot

1490
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:10,111
Figure it out but for now I don't know

1491
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
They had him as a

1492
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
It would be

1493
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,767
The greatest day ever finds out we're doing this

1494
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
I'm sure

1495
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,119
I know I almost guarantee

1496
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,959
We've got meetings Illinois

1497
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007
I guarantee

1498
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,383
If he were to find out that we're doing the show

1499
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
He would bring it up

1500
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,271
Jesse Wood

1501
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,599
Even if even if we still never had any less even if it were

1502
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,671
30 listeners

1503
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:51,071
He would totally do that I also think even though we're doing this show out of my bedroom

1504
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,399
But I also think he would accuse us of being MSN

1505
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,983
Soros funded

1506
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,079
Sitting in damn

1507
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,895
That's the other thing that is kind of amazing about the world

1508
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
We live in

1509
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,015
He only makes

1510
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Stronger

1511
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,879
Oh so we're like Obi-Wan in this

1512
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
So eat

1513
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
It's entirely possible

1514
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
That's

1515
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
Any any of those two

1516
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,047
Have You Ever Seen The Boondocks

1517
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,607
Find another comic strip

1518
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
So there was a

1519
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
They had

1520
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Gray table saw

1521
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,287
Ann Coulter

1522
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,591
And then Al Sharpton

1523
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
And how they would go on those

1524
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Yelling at each

1525
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,247
Green Room

1526
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,343
This is so much fun how we get to do this

1527
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
And it's all men

1528
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,439
Pretending to have a boy

1529
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
Point of view you want

1530
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,839
The Labyrinth scam

1531
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,055
No interest in a scam

1532
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
I just want to laugh at Alex

1533
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,151
We will affect my lutely

1534
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,943
Disguise any

1535
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,295
The s*** out of your advert

1536
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,183
I don't know if you really

1537
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,719
Oh my God the market

1538
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
Is on the rise

1539
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,327
What would you say would happen if I don't know like the

1540
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Electronic

1541
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,263
Platinum still have

1542
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,823
For me to get into right now

1543
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
You buy Platinum

1544
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
You going to get your dick suck

1545
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,271
Anyway we have one more clip this is Alex Jones's big

1546
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,831
Closer

1547
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:54,207
I am going to bring out a cigarette

1548
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Cuz

1549
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,023
I think we got a smoke one wow he

1550
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Close out his set

1551
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
This

1552
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,143
Is one of the most

1553
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,191
Alex Jones

1554
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,983
Style

1555
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
The Alex Jones

1556
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,295
Santa was peeking out from

1557
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:46,848
The first of all we should all be so f****** lucky as to have that kind of an introduction

1558
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,664
God

1559
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,968
I was too afraid to face the New World Order

1560
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,040
But you got to hear what he says at like right after

1561
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
Introduces Stanhope

1562
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
Crazy

1563
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:18,336
God dammit

1564
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,088
So he's 8 couldn't make that out what he's like

1565
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Swing first

1566
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
And see what happens

1567
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,440
It'll be on video

1568
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
That's amazing imagine if

1569
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Here's what I want to bring up

1570
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,608
His

1571
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
His callers were not

1572
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,704
And he actually had to

1573
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
To deal with Baba Booey

1574
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,544
Baba Booey

1575
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,848
All of his broadcast

1576
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
Would just be

1577
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,640
Unveiled

1578
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
Threats

1579
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:59,808
All the time there would be so many smart people dancing circles around him

1580
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,856
I think I seen him

1581
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,160
I think the only way that he responds

1582
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,184
Any challenge

1583
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
Is through the threat of

1584
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:13,120
I'll kick your ass p**** and there's no there's no

1585
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
You love the new world order

1586
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
Which

1587
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
It's a one-to-one comparison for the Wolfpack

1588
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
Yeah they're big

1589
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,528
No Wolfpack with red and black

1590
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,344
Hollywood

1591
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
I didn't like the lineup of Hollywood

1592
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,512
I always prefer

1593
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,328
All I remember is the red and black

1594
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,936
Cuz it seems like

1595
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,264
Challenge

1596
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Slightest chance

1597
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,824
It is

1598
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,104
Immediate viola

1599
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,152
Well it's immediate flip into character

1600
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
You think this is

1601
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,248
Character

1602
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,320
Like when he yelled a couple times

1603
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,624
To get into

1604
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
The Alex Jones persona

1605
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Other than

1606
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
Just rambling about Nan

1607
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,768
Westlake

1608
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,792
Off-air

1609
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:20,704
Not pleasant I don't know I'm sure there are nice qualities about him I'm sure he's not a monster of a

1610
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
But like

1611
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,264
I bet he wouldn't be

1612
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Yeah but

1613
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
I think depressed him

1614
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:32,736
We learned that on the last episode Barfly Alex Jones microphone

1615
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,040
Is Charles Bukowski

1616
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Concentration camp

1617
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
In Austin

1618
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,464
But the thing I wanted to bring up was that

1619
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
All this talk

1620
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
About

1621
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,304
Bill Hicks faked

1622
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
That's a very Bill Hicks

1623
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,704
Send

1624
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
Yeah that's

1625
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
You're dumb p****

1626
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,408
Hello, dumb

1627
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
That whole bit

1628
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Texas

1629
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,320
Text or it's proof that Alex Jones

1630
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
Which I won

1631
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,904
Ma

1632
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,232
But is it is

1633
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
Oh man but it was

1634
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
Let's live in a world where

1635
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
There's no

1636
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
And that sort of

1637
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,360
I hope it lives up to the hype that I built

1638
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,152
That was some solid

1639
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
Wow that's

1640
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
Isn't it mind-blowing

1641
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,248
These weird

1642
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,856
Turtles that we keep finding all this stuff

1643
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,160
Right now I had no I had no idea

1644
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,720
That's a that's a whole idea

1645
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:48,768
Hi

1646
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,536
Dammit

1647
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,864
The opportunities that he has to be crazier in

1648
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
All the time

1649
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
Is mind-boggling

1650
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
Yeah

1651
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
We should do I make

1652
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
Trio marriage

1653
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:10,528
Well you're good Christian man I'm a good Christian man I think we all agree

1654
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
If he would be the third host of

1655
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,088
This podcast

1656
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
And we can just get like

1657
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:15,648
Tony said that

1658
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,440
The best

1659
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,720
Cast

1660
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,280
Yeah

1661
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
A after

1662
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:26,912
Interview Leanne

1663
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,960
Does judge mean

1664
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:32,032
I'm assuming that he doesn't have

1665
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
Staff writer

1666
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,640
Like you know but nobody right

1667
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,088
The show

1668
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,392
Leave the clips are indicative of the show as a whole

1669
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
No way you could

1670
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,488
But it's so mean

1671
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Yeah it's

1672
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,352
If you have to fill

1673
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,680
It's an admirable skill

1674
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,728
Well with most people can't risk

1675
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,264
That's true

1676
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Fly up

1677
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
If you need

1678
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:09,920
2 hours of time filled and you don't care about the quality

1679
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
It's like he's just a

1680
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,064
Sports Talk radio host

1681
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
4

1682
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
Conspiracy

1683
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
For the global

1684
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,256
Boogeyman

1685
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Is the globalist

1686
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,072
No matter what

1687
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
Can go back to it

1688
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
The soundboard I can play

1689
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,704
I'm your boogie man

1690
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:38,592
I bet pre pre ready

1691
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,128
Because it's so vague

1692
