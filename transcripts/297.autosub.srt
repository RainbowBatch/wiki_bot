00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
Best meal you've ever

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
I've made some stir fries that were pretty good

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
I think that's about it

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
I'm not really

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
Not very

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Broad in my like a food

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,032
The other night I famously have said many times that if it were an option I would just

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
I probably would rather just not eat

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
I don't

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,480
I like some dishes and all that and I get the pleasure of eating but it's not a big deal for me

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
I would take food replacement

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552

Absolutely

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
When you get those papers up and running you're going to have to

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,576
Don't see a show where I probably but maybe learn how to cook in the future

22
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,704
We will see there's a lot of meat on the table

23
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Pretty intense

24
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
Idea about

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
Is there a reason that I couldn't ever

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Possibly comprehend

31
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Well the reasons you would expect our because we're going back to look over his coverage in the aftermath

32
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,104
Sandy Hook narrative that there is

33
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Okay

34
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664

79
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
I am very seriously considering

80
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
And have put minimal effort

81
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
Put some effort into a couple of

82
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759

83
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551

Here is where Alex's head

94
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
He's covering a little bit of a new story

95
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
That he finds

96
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Very excited

97
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
This is also a cam

103
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Warning everyone

104
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
That there will be

105
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
Mathway codes

106
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Stand-off United States

107
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
When the gun grab that isn't coming

108
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,191
That might be what your perception is based on what

109
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
I'm not sure that's what

110
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,823
Was the mayor of Gloversville New York

111
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
It's the middle of the state which

112
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Cuz once a hug

113
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Its name

114
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
From the 1880s 90%

115
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Through the weather in tanning Industries in Gloversville

116
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
There were over 100 leather and glove companies in

117
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Season 70s

118
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
As foreign suppliers became a

119
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
And the New York State pure water program

120
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
When the federal much more expensive

121
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
For leather tanneries to do their business

122
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Missouri super polluting business

123
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Chemical process

124
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Has a

125
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Contaminate Water Supplies

126
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
If not disposed of properly

127
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Which is something to add

128
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
4952

129
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
Gloversville lost a third of its population

130
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
1000

131
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
600 residence

132
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
To about 15,000

133
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
All in all it's a tragic

134
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Example of a City built on a single industry

135
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Which we discovered

136
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
Was killing the planet

137
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Tree by-products

138
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591

Shingletown

140
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Confused

141
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
That was

142
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Is it

143
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,327
But sometimes a little walk

144
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,751
Kind of fruitions Gloversville

145
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Dayton King was mayor of Gloversville from

146
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
2010's

147
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
2018

148
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
The end of King time as mayor is a

149
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,199
Completely sucked up story

150
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
King was elected

151
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,343
First time

152
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
He decided to run again in 2018

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
I want the vote

154
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
Lost local firefighter

155
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Junior

156
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Was really close

157
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,887
A recount it was found that they were missed

158
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
And they were enough to give King to win by a margin

159
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
28 votes

160
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
Robeck took the news

161
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,871
Congratulate everybody move forward

162
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Understory

163
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
End of story We there's nothing further to report here where do

164
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Gloversville is a Wonder

165
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
You don't notice the weirdness that his term ended in 2018 are you want that electric

166
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,559
Situation

167
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
After he was arrested

168
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
What was he arrested for you at

169
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Well you got caught sneaking into government property after hours and stealing

170
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Falsified records to cover his tracks

171
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Use charged with a felony but in a plea deal

172
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
Who's allowed Justice

173
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:06,207
The $473 he stolen stamps

174
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,375
Even I will admit that's a little bit lamp

175
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
Maybe $473 in postage

176
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Send it

177
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,431
437 dollars worth of a man who knows

178
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,063
Maybe it's Unbecoming for a mayor to falsify records

179
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
The cover-up is fastest

180
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,719
This applies only think about dating King that was sketchy I might say whatever

181
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Yeah a little bit

182
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,095
However the first time the mayor King

183
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
Arrested while in office

184
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Imperial

185
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
If only

186
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Why did you say that it was fairly Reese

187
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
This guy is a dick

188
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,783
The previous time happened during the 2018 Mayoral race

189
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
Official misconduct

190
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,439
The results of the personnel file

191
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Fitzwilliam brobeck Junior

192
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
From his time as a firefighter

193
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Are releasing that information on air during the

194
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
Mind-blowing

195
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
After that

196
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
With polls showing the election

197
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
Okay

198
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Degree harassment

199
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Write a letter of apology to row back in

200
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Gloversville firefighters

201
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
For violating a state

202
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Civil rights law

203
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,671
He was out there violating people's Civil Right

204
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
And then just be like okay cool

205
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Great when it was stamped

206
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
What's the temperature

207
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,615
Bank of America in

208
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
Seems like a real piece of s***

209
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
In 2013 he was interviewed on the local news

210
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,255
Second clip

211
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
But there's some people who predicted Waco's situation that won't end well

212
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,191
It's not really clear that he's voicing opposition to

213
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Justice

214
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
DC some possible negative,

215
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Some crazies

216
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
I'm not sure if he's even speaking of them negative

217
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,759
I don't know

218
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
Paul Joseph Watson Road an article on Infowars the claim that the Clippers

219
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,463
And a whole lot of the right-wing media picked up on that which is what Alex

220
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Is doing here

221
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Alex doesn't know what he's talking about and it's per usual

222
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
The guy is building up as a good guy in government

223
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Guns is actually a local election mix

224
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Naturally

225
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Good Times

226
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Together they're always

227
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Together all the comments

228
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
Actually even shows up I know that

229
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
To get him on

230
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
But it's just because

231
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
He said something about Gunn

232
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
God I hate

233
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
For the people

234
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
The people

235
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Struggle

236
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Start people struggles

237
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
It's something

238
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Normal to have

239
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
2019 FX

240
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
You might struggle

241
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
The Gap theory on the 70

242
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
Interesting to learn more about this guy

243
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
He is a sheriff

244
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
Oh no I'm already out

245
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,487
We will not

246
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Surprise

247
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Sheriff

248
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
First sheriff

249
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Okay so Danny payment

250
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Is this guy

251
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,775
The sheriff of Jackson County

252
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,615
In Kentucky when we go back

253
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:46,015
Dishonorable action story

254
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
These people that Alex has on his

255
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Killers in

256
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
An exemption

257
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,815
Close

258
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
2013

259
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Like he had

260
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Little over a year left

261
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
For years before he was

262
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
Right on the cusp of being sent to prison

263
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
Four years as Sheriff Denny payment received warnings

264
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
He was running

265
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Pictures of Jackson County Sheriff's Department

266
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Did the mismanagement

267
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
These were generally soft

268
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Supposed to

269
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
The audit of the department

270
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,095
2012

271
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Have concluded

272
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Head knot

273
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Was not keeping appropriate risk

274
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
He was not tracking

275
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
New salary limits

276
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
According to the County's approved budget

277
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
Department of over $112,000

278
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
And the Fiscal Court

279
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Well

280
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,183
And that the Fiscal Court had already loaned his Department 277 thousand dollars pay salaries would not reimburse

281
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
These numbers are completely insane

282
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Particularly when you learn

283
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Kentucky.gov

284
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
The Jackson County Kentucky Sheriff's department has exactly seven officers

285
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
That number may have been

286
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
There's very small

287
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
It's unclear

288
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
I don't know

289
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
I don't know

290
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
I'm not I wouldn't make that allegation

291
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
Mismanagement to action

292
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
That's sad that is a papa

293
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Course

294
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
William Osman

295
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
County Office

296
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Any audit report there's a section where payment could

297
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Responded

298
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
Just being real.

299
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Things like there be

300
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,199
Being taken care of and that he didn't know where these were happening or that these things were prompt

301
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Flash Forward about a year

302
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
He's not taking care of the sheriff's

303
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Problem

304
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
So again

305
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Raise and controls

306
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Department of Finance

307
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Take it away

308
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
And given to the Fiscal Court

309
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
And they also start another

310
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Police Department really think that should have been the

311
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
The first time

312
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
What you doing

313
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
To fix the problems are 100,000

314
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Missing that.

315
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Highway

316
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
The number was

317
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
The county couldn't afford to allow it to

318
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Well

319
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Didn't take kindly to

320
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
All January 2014

321
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,727
You showed up to a meeting with the County Fiscal Court and arrest bet Sally and judge William Smith

322
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
Who happened to be in the middle of conductors of medic

323
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
Naturally this life this life to the meeting having to be adjourned with some interesting responses from

324
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
Article in the Lexington Herald-Leader

325
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,623
County attorney George Hayes

326
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,951
George Smith

327
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
But we had to adjourn cuz there's no one running

328
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,863
County Clerk Donald Duck Moore said with a laugh

329
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
You still in The Blues Brothers

330
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
I know it's not funny but still

331
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
A number of people at the meeting were pretty

332
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Concerned they just Witness

333
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
Missed an overt example of authority

334
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
His only motivation is to clean up local government

335
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
There's nothing political about doing what's right

336
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,231
Smith with tampering with public records

337
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Publix

338
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,607
Are engaging in organized crime through extortion

339
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
You started writing in

340
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,087
No it's just him

341
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Easy it's just head out

342
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Did he did he write everything

343
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Hangout with a pen

344
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Maybe

345
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,303
Unilaterally arrested judge County Treasurer because

346
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
The sheriff

347
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
Years apart

348
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,239
There's no Sheriff movement called

349
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Be a sheriff and part of the Constitution

350
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Sheriff moving

351
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Self-serving

352
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
That's that's a bad idea

353
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
These constitutional Sheriff

354
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Do not hold up

355
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Reality

356
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,367
Is that what he did was against the law

357
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Smith were dropped on February 6th

358
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
2014

359
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Fallout

360
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,767
Wildly

361
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Stupid

362
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
Federal court and eventually reach the settlement

363
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
$2,500

364
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Quite frankly

365
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,103
Election

366
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
In 2040

367
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,551
And then get zero punishment for it there

368
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
You know like

369
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
40 / 437

370
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
Stamp doesn't Trump

371
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
Civil rights

372
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Sprite

373
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
You know what's f***** up

374
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Judge Smith

375
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Was Queen

376
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Yeah

377
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
But

378
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
Play the 50/50

379
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
2050

380
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
You try to arrest her for your prior

381
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:56,191
It's one of those situations where the cops try to frame someone who also happens to be guilty

382
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Haitian and his charges work

383
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:02,335
Complete s*** but it turns out

384
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
Go to jail

385
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
Tarasco

386
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
You didn't face criminal charges for that

387
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
But

388
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,560
He wasn't arrested and charged with drug trafficking

389
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
Set up a hemp Farm

390
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Permission to grow

391
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,544
Actually decide to start growing straight up and was involved in trafficking

392
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
Actually I think we should be legal and I don't think that someone is clearly an a******

393
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
I do think there's some extenuating circumstances here

394
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
To bring up to judge him

395
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Infarct

396
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
The first is that when police showed up they didn't just find weed

397
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
They also found eight vials of steroids

398
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
But you didn't have a legal reason to have which is an amount that law enforcement

399
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Considers indicative of traffic

400
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Reloaded gun

401
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Typically placed in the house today

402
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Defend payments marijuana-growing operation

403
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,176
He might of a bit more than just some cool weed growing

404
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
The profit off locking people up

405
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
For drug-related crime

406
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,928
According to the 2016 date

407
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Kentucky.gov of the 207 arrest

408
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
County Sheriff's

409
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
I almost

410
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Halfway photography

411
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,800
Part of a system that works for drug charges

412
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,408
Deaconess whatever sympathy is left after exhaust arrested while

413
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Yeah

414
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
So

415
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,624
Those charges on

416
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,048
Yeah

417
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:02,912
It does seem that way we haven't realized

418
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
If we just started locking

419
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
White men who do weird s*** like this

420
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Play better off

421
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
Present

422
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
I'm saying you should go to jail and in 2013 he was awarded the high noon award

423
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
We literally playing Cowboys

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,304
Indians right now

425
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,888
Larry Pratt

426
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Sponsors

427
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
The award is given to those who quotes

428
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
Stanford has run

429
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
Tell the truth even though a politically incorrect

430
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,664
Can't help but think that payment to feel like

431
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,224
If you could just unilaterally erect a judge later

432
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,088
Interesting Lee payment was one of the high noon Awards

433
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Can 2013

434
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
The other was none other than captain

435
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Sheriff David

436
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,056
I don't know

437
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
I don't know

438
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
It's pretty strange

439
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Butts

440
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Show me cuz I care.

441
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
The whole thing

442
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
To comprehend

443
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
Silver spring summer concerts

444
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,792
Right

445
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
You're not the highest Authority in

446
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Because we're not

447
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Bright

448
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
No it's not

449
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Alex talks about how Obama took

450
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Took everything

451
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Everything from

452
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
The good

453
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,536
He has a lot of

454
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,376
Personal aggrievement complaints

455
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,472
I really f***** up take on

456
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,336
Unsurprising

457
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
I don't like that at all I don't like any I don't like anything about that

458
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Alex was taken aback for a second

459
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,816
Damn man is weird things a man

460
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Settling

461
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
As unsettling just from Layla

462
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
A discernment perspective

463
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Zane hearing

464
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Describe the tea party like

465
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
This is weird

466
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Maybe they are

467
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,120
Yeah maybe baby

468
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
Means that they're obviously

469
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
That's one way of looking

470
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,640
And Alex has Lou Rockwell as a guest libertarian

471
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
Sure

472
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
That's an oxy

473
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
It's a really really boring

474
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Interview

475
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't care

476
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
We don't have time

477
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,976
For goddamn Lew Rockwell

478
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
We'll get to him another day will come back

479
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
And say something interesting

480
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
I will get to him then

481
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Because Alex

482
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
And it got me ears

483
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,008
The point is

484
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
Information

485
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,928
We got a really interesting position that Alex

486
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Expressing

487
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Which is

488
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
Really again really wanting

489
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
To call it a false flag

490
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
Someone's going to hit

491
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Before kind of idea

492
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
The factory

493
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
He's resisting at all

494
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Confusing in

495
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
In the present

496
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
Aware that it's a line that

497
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
You can't

498
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
I think he understands

499
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Consequences

500
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
Yeah a little bit better

501
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Is this time frame

502
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
We're going to get into it tomorrow

503
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Get back

504
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
F*** off Lube

505
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
About

506
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Paul Joseph Watson

507
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
His feelings

508
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Tamara

509
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
So I think we can take away from that

510
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Is that Alex

511
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
Who's responding to audience

512
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
In the present day

513
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
The audience

514
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,008
Made a lot of requests

515
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Recover Sandy Hook

516
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
No I think you're I think it's very clear that there's Market pressure

517
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Pretty resistant to cover it up till this

518
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Giving him some

519
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,464
Allegedly

520
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
Some pushback

521
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
Because he has to respond to

522
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,632
You want the audience

523
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
Wants him to do

524
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,008
You can see it clearly their ardor

525
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
In terms of the lawsuit

526
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
Is profiting off

527
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,432
At least Deacon Frost

528
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
Whether or not

529
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:18,368
Whether or not

530
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,696
I don't know how much that illegal

531
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
But whatever

532
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
Episode Alex

533
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
Call from a guy

534
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
About another gun grab

535
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,216
I just hope

536
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:38,848
Because it's going to be used

537
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Reimburse

538
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
People for weapons that are taking one of their voluntarily or not

539
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,256
This Monday is HR 226

540
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
IRS

541
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,544
For complicated

542
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:17,760
So I get information from my real

543
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,528
Repeat

544
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
226 is a house resolution was designed to alter the IRS $2,000 of a text

545
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
Credit to people who elected

546
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Surrender their assault weapons

547
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Do the federal state or local

548
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,936
Is completely voluntary it specifies that it was about creating an incentive people

549
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
To get the number of weapons laying around down

550
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
Yeah it's super pointless to debate the fine points

551
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
Because as it literally always

552
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
Case Malik Springs up a gun bill

553
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
This was already dead in committee by the time the caller is telling Alex City

554
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,368
3 days before this episode the bill was sent to the house and literally nowak's

555
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Was ever taken on it and

556
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
Is there it died

557
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Didn't know about it exist

558
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,560
He doesn't keep up with the news

559
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
You going to keep up with his

560
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Premier table top

561
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,936
All he's about his gun rights

562
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
There is a f******

563
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
Bill in the house

564
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,080
The fairy isn't evil

565
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,920
Never know about

566
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
This is pathetic

567
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,856
The main struggle

568
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
To the 17th

569
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Process

570
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
For now because

571
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
Alex took off on the 8th

572
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,032
Okay and generally covering a day when Alex

573
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,896
The general wouldn't unprecedented would never do that

574
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,504
But this is too important for us to 300 plus

575
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,040
And here we are

576
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Talk about

577
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Shuffle David nights

578
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,648
Earlier

579
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,696
Paul Joseph Watson

580
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
And I honestly think it was a strategic decision on Alex's part

581
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
A vacation that he actually wanted

582
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
I don't think that

583
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Wanted to be anywhere near

584
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
This

585
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Justin

586
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Right

587
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,848
Because Paul Joseph Watson has a little bit of a gas

588
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
With

589
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,456
You're getting a little too excited

590
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Nothing's over

591
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,064
Alex doesn't want to be directly tied to

592
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
Behind the Sun

593
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,704
Is perfect perfect

594
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,800
So James

595
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
The professor from Florida Atlantic

596
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
University

597
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,408
Is Paul Joseph Watson

598
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
Tracy was already pitching crisis actor

599
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Conspiracies

600
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
The sort of thing if you're going to have him

601
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
You are responsible for pushing back on

602
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Andalous

603
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,472
Especially for someone who the day before Alex said Paul Joseph Watson is critical of these theories

604
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Do you expect

605
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Prepare to protect

606
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,336
Conspiracy world that he is involved in

607
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
From someone who's dangerous ideas

608
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
The purity of the turf

609
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,016
I thought I thought

610
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
JW was giving him

611
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
Push back

612
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
It was

613
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
The same way that his listeners

614
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
You should go and papa soon

615
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Opposite

616
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
Paul Joseph Watson is a voice of reason Alex's

617
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Conception

618
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
Paul Joseph Watson

619
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
Paul's going to try

620
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Pay lip service to that position as interviews

621
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:53,824
Professor James

622
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,616
Tracy

623
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Pictures

624
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Kikiwaka wafer

625
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
Is that he's

626
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
He's trying to mainstream

627
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,808
As a

628
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,136
Questioner legitimate

629
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
Or or something

630
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
The feeling that I had that this wasn't going to be a great interview

631
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Started almost immediate

632
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,144
Absolutely

633
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
360 last Friday

634
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,104
25 minutes

635
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
Bicycle

636
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,552
That's an exaggeration

637
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,320
For sure

638
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
Your picture

639
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
I've just about every

640
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
Every time you call

641
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,328
I thought this was really crazy cuz

642
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Literally a minute

643
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:56,032
Deep Sad Piano

644
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
Montague Island

645
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,016
Talking about somebody

646
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
Everybody

647
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
So I don't know

648
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
But your ear

649
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,744
Victim

650
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
Characterization

651
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,096
Are you being pilloried by the media

652
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Questions

653
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:25,216
Mainstream narrative everybody wants to believe the same

654
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Nothing but we got to have those sticker

655
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,800
Turns out there

656
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,616
So

657
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Expresses

658
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,408
Sets forth

659
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
His position

660
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,992
And that is what he doesn't believe these theories

661
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
In fairness to him

662
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
I will

663
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Hear this

664
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:56,192
We're going to go over some of the questions that he and others have raised

665
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
The Sandy Hook massacre

666
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,800
I think there's an appropriate way to do this

667
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
For Paul to live in that space

668
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
I don't believe any of this.

669
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah require pushback

670
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
It requires

671
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
Knowing and presenting accurately

672
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
What this guy is saying

673
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:21,792
Not misrepresent what he saying to paint him as a victim of the mainstream media's bully

674
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
I think that's important

675
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,424
We already know he's not going to do that

676
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
This is going to be

677
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
So you think

678
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
You think he

679
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
Keep playing a game on

680
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,360
Using Paul Joseph is

681
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
But actually does believe it

682
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
Acting is

683
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
Is the

684
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Residence

685
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,392
It's going to be over at

686
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,720
I don't think it's the second

687
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,048
I think it's smart and you understand

688
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
This is

689
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
A Sticky Wicket

690
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
This is going this is a trap

691
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:05,056
Yeah if I if I get involved

692
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,408
I will be in League with whatever the consequences are

693
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,552
I think he's smart enough to be aware of that

694
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,368
Gotcha but at the same time

695
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
A dyed-in-the-wool

696
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
Instinctual propaganda

697
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
That he knows the people with the

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Extreme opinions

699
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,048
It's good for business

700
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
2

701
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Allows them

702
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
The theories are very

703
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
Popular like as reference

704
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
What's the last day Alex

705
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
Dina people are knocking down their door

706
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
To talk about how they were actors

707
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
Seahawk

708
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,064
All that stuff so poor kind of knows what it's good for business

709
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
To not be like

710
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
F*** you professor

711
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Tracy what you're doing

712
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,464
Is shameful I don't believe it

713
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
You have no evidence yet

714
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:02,656
Because then you're going to alienate knocking down your door and demanding you have this conversation

715
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Just alienate

716
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Could alienate

717
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,128
Maybe

718
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
His listeners who would

719
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
His home

720
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:22,880
Yeah

721
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:28,256
Call is smart enough and is done this long enough to be

722
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
He's smart enough to understand like

723
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,120
There is no proof of this

724
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Is

725
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Shity

726
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,800
The airs on the side of what's good for business

727
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,432
So Alex is gone but that doesn't stop him from

728
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:51,040
Calling to the court for like 10 minutes to the show

729
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
Here's a little bit of that

730
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
My son so boring

731
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,472
College

732
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,360
Infowars.com to call in here

733
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
Don't care anymore

734
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,400
Because we know we're listening to people on the phone

735
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:43,776
Well

736
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
Alex's on the phone from camp

737
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
On the phone from floor

738
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Yeah

739
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
This is

740
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
This is

741
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
Visually

742
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
But is an audio.

743
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:01,696
Interesting because what's going on is Alex's taking the day off

744
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:08,096
Office in the middle of the days I suck it I got to check in with

745
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Bucolic

746
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
My own website we were inaccurate

747
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,456
Plug for his own coverage

748
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
In a weird way

749
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
But

750
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,832
Talking about

751
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,416
Of course about

752
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
I am Department of Homeland

753
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
Security they put out some training videos

754
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,888
Yeah it's terrorist in the video are not Arabs

755
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,984
Middle Eastern

756
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
What is the terrorist

757
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
Does complaintive

758
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Kind of

759
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
Where are the terrorists

760
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
So

761
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,559
You can get a sense

762
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,031
Your son wants to go fishing off the f******

763
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Phone

764
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
Nothing nothing like camping you know you remember camping is

765
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
The kids you go out

766
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
The middle of the Forest right

767
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Your fire and you

768
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991

Home show

770
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
Blame

771
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
I can take a day off you're not breaking news with Napolitano

772
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,511
Like White House

773
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,303
Rejected must your kids feel

774
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,631
I would feel

775
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Real not great

776
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
Also I don't believe you static

777
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,567
What kind of leaves

778
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,223
My radar

779
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Call baby

780
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
Interview with the crazy dude alright

781
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
We get to it

782
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
Deer Park

783
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
Described as a very friendly introduction

784
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Interview

785
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,127
Conspiracy

786
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:45,279
So I don't believe you're having an interview with someone like this you necessarily need to

787
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
First of all

788
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
F*** off

789
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,143
It's okay to have some pleasant

790
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
There's nothing I would condemn

791
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Yet

792
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,687
You can only call him

793
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Professor

794
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Well because

795
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,647
And even then like not if you're interviewing him now anyway

796
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,255
All of that stuff is there to burnish him as a

797
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Credulous

798
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Subject

799
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:22,399
Somebody who has information he's a priest

800
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,959
He's he's well-read and well-educated

801
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
He runs his own blog

802
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
He even does

803
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Has classes on

804
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
Conspiracy so of course

805
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,639
Endive

806
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
Point out is that

807
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Is

808
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
In Florida

809
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Has never been

810
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,271
And should shut

811
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
The f****** about

812
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
That seems like

813
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Spell

814
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,815
What you're describing him in this fashion

815
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
Goes a little bit even further

816
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
In this

817
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,983
This is a question

818
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,591
I don't actually think they get to a real

819
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,687
Conspiracy

820
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,735
Self-victimization

821
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,759
Aggrandizement

822
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Because

823
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
Close

824
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,671
Do it all this is to do is this the first question

825
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
How do I request

826
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,791
It is to establish immediately in the interview

827
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
Is the victim

828
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,351
Of a harsh assault

829
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
By the mainstream media

830
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,727
So if you hear something for the mainstream media that super negative about

831
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:35,359
Text

832
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
I want to talk about

833
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Bicycle

834
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,391
Week

835
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,119
Profession

836
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,471
Doing the same thing

837
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,895
Professor position

838
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
So

839
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,183
So you see there in the framing

840
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
The point comes the question

841
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,375
Frieza question like that unless you were wanting to paint this person is the unfair Target

842
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,679
Of some sort of

843
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,543
Vitriol from the mainstream establishment

844
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
It's like when they write

845
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Students if you wrote that question on a pool

846
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
You're not going to get an accurate read

847
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
You're going to snow

848
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,855
Set up for a spike

849
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
James Tracy knows how to f****** answer a question about his own oppression

850
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,463
It's it's ridiculous

851
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
If your intention show through

852
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,375
When you ask a question like that regardless of how many times

853
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,679
You say you don't believe the things you say

854
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Which Paul doesn't

855
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
In this next clip

856
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
When in this clip I believe

857
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
It lays out pretty clearly

858
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
What I was describing

859
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
What is motivation

860
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,455
The desire to personally be above it while at the

861
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,247
The same time doing what's best for business

862
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
Because everyone wants them

863
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
To cover this

864
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
Is a video on YouTube

865
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,071
Call the Sandy Hook shooting

866
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:44,383
Shows you how

867
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
I'm coming out

868
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,015
What's the question

869
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
Parents Day

870
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Family members

871
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
Some people inflamed

872
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
So

873
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,783
6 million people or whatever watch this video in 10 days

874
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
Credibly huge Market

875
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,159
We hope to siphon some interviewing you

876
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,743
Unsatisfying

877
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
I can't

878
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
I can't be

879
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
Personal

880
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,423
It's so perfectly clear here

881
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Fuel to the herd

882
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
Burdensome

883
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Deserve like

884
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,775
If you're listening to this while this guy huh

885
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Has a video that

886
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:45,311
That has over 10

887
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,127
Chameleon video

888
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,431
I don't think it's his video

889
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
Informed is Paul about who's interviewing

890
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Because like

891
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
If he knew things

892
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,975
Tracy was

893
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
He wouldn't

894
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
Be able to walk this line

895
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,911
Presented at

896
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
If you are a person

897
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,287
Who believes that this was a real tragedy

898
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,847
You don't believe the people who are

899
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
Putting out things

900
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Respectful

901
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
To the people who lost loved ones or died

902
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
There

903
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Why would you

904
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Put up with

905
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
And

906
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:31,135
Help the person who's making those theories

907
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Bios

908
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Questions that are designed

909
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
To play right into the

910
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
The things that they're able to

911
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,327
To make them look good and reasonable

912
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
Why would you do that it doesn't make sense

913
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,655
Even if your fault

914
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Paul has more incentive to not behave that way

915
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
Because he has

916
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
A conspiracy business to protect

917
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Like this make any sense

918
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,151
With a well-run show

919
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,623
Unbelievable that you would not

920
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
No

921
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
Who is coming on you

922
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,839
We believe he did zero preparation and he's just having a grand ol time because

923
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
But if so it

924
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,519
Is weird that he keeps saying I don't believe this stuff he doesn't believe

925
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
I don't know I just

926
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
There's a real

927
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Nefarious intent

928
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,735
Be back here in this next question

929
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
That he asked

930
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,319
I'll because if you follow the framing of the quest

931
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Again and

932
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,903
Incredibly manipulative.

933
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
It's trying to

934
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
See where he needs

935
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,511
To go in order to

936
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Mysterious

937
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:47,423
Self-professed

938
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,807
Evenness

939
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,927
AR-15

940
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
Images

941
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
That's a f******

942
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Awful Quest

943
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
That is

944
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,367
Giving a fiery and then being like you want to talk about that

945
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,927
That is not

946
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,975
That's crazy

947
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
What are you doing

948
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
Setting up that question is

949
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,351
Dishonest

950
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,191
The framing implies has proven that Obama is trying to take people's guns

951
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Manipulative

952
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
Sandy Hook to do that because of an

953
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
The entire premise of the quest

954
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Heavily on that bias position

955
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,735
And deemed fact within the framing

956
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Question

957
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,807
Secondly a trick that class

958
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,111
The Conspiracy Theory full shade artist

959
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,159
Do we see the play out over and over

960
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
They set the standard of

961
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,815
Deem as acceptable proof of something then when they get that proof they move goal post

962
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,863
Provided isn't it

963
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Itself fake

964
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Cuz actually approved

965
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:23,423
The conspiracy

966
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,447
That they were pitching

967
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
In the first place

968
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,311
The idea of surveillance

969
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Give us a surveillance footage

970
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
That's why we are

971
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,943
It's all just b******* long form birth

972
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,671
Nothing Obama could have ever released or provided would have satisfied the people who are invested in making the argument

973
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,439
The US citizen

974
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:53,375
You wrote that down.

975
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Position to argue from

976
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
Attacktix like this Bellator intense

977
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Once again

978
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
Images of Paul Joseph Watson

979
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
Specific question there's a number series problems

980
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
One is a yes no idea

981
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Different School

982
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Pics of different budgets

983
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
The policies listing of other schools where shootings happen

984
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
But doesn't really stand up to scrutiny

985
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Have a good

986
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
That's what evidence should exist

987
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
The case of the shooting

988
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,671
Point of order

989
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,487
The fact that you are referencing

990
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
School shooting

991
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Things that you think

992
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,631
Wow

993
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
So basically do they don't

994
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,959
Snow

995
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,335
Christ even though they get the standard weapon problem

996
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
These people

997
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:42,015
So much all those other examples

998
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
Virginia Tech are high school and college

999
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
Respectively

1000
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,159
Obviously have different security protocols Elementary School

1001
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,999
It's not worthwhile comparison for him to be making his like we had

1002
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Pictures and videos of their why not here

1003
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
The most important Point here is that even if the police or FBI released footage or images of Adam Lanza committing the shooting

1004
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:07,359
It will become the new Grist for the mill of conspiracy

1005
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
Conceded his eyes turned the wrong direction

1006
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
So either he's got a lazy

1007
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
Somebody

1008
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,575
Airbrush right

1009
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
Zoom in on it

1010
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
It's exactly what they would do they look

1011
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,975
For any irregularities could possibly be there

1012
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
Be the new proof of

1013
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
Conspiracy is blah blah blah

1014
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,631
This question is a horrible way to lead off the interview unless

1015
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
The intention is to

1016
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,447
A professor

1017
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,239
Completely reasonable person is just ask

1018
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:39,103
Questions as opposed to someone who's actively making slanderous claims about the family members of murder chill

1019
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,431
I think that's what

1020
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,735
Yeah so Paul asked about the security system

1021
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,183
The Sandy Hook School District

1022
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
Nevada

1023
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
Gear with regard to what is actually going on

1024
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:22,623
We can safely conclude is nonsense you're totally right totally

1025
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:27,487
Playwright

1026
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,535
There were articles about that that were available

1027
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
The system isn't cut

1028
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
High-tech surveillance

1029
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
For the whole school

1030
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,543
Running back towards system gear

1031
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Strategy

1032
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:48,479
The doors of the school be locked after 9:30 a.m.

1033
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
Order to get in

1034
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Boss R&B record

1035
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,087
Nice by someone in the office

1036
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,647
Where are you can see them through security monitor

1037
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,463
That's the only definite camera to school at the door

1038
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:03,071
As Adam Lanza

1039
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
There's no reason to even be certain

1040
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
That camera would have caught images

1041
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,519
I'm coming in at 9 everybody

1042
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,871
Conclude that there were cameras in every single one of those windows up

1043
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Play they didn't

1044
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Skimp on the bus

1045
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
Get for their new security right

1046
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
So let's start from the position

1047
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,295
Cameras everywhere in this

1048
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,135
I think maybe asking

1049
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,183
For something that doesn't exist

1050
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
End

1051
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Insisting that

1052
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,511
It not being released

1053
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Proof

1054
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:39,167
We're living in this dystopian Society

1055
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
Security cameras

1056
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
In 2012

1057
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
Hallmark

1058
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
Sandy Hook conspiracy

1059
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,407
Exaggerating the scale of the new security

1060
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,479
The school had put in a few months prior

1061
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,783
Is allowed on this show to just

1062
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
That's what their systems were

1063
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
When is estimation

1064
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
The money people in town

1065
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,231
It is a sumption that their wealth must be the best everything available

1066
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,047
This is based on nothing but speculation

1067
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Nothing

1068
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,935
Nothing to push back

1069
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
Pushed back

1070
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,455
Publicly

1071
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,991
Funded building

1072
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,039
Design corner

1073
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
I think that's the really rich the game or taxes

1074
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,951
Property taxes

1075
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
School

1076
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
Going to making black people go to prison

1077
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
Explains that if only there was evidence

1078
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
Surveillance footage

1079
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
So

1080
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Acting from a dishonest

1081
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Position

1082
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,391
He knows fully well that releasing the footage would not put anyone

1083
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,415
Aquarius to rest

1084
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,439
Here's how I know that

1085
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:09,535
And Paul Joseph Watson

1086
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,559
As an example of

1087
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,119
School shooting

1088
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Hey guess what

1089
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
Uber X

1090
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,055
All the releasing the footage does it take away the argument that it never

1091
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
It's so easy for the

1092
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
Conspiracy to survive by

1093
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,943
Can you talk

1094
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,271
Professor whose claim to study

1095
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
Conspiracies

1096
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
Knows damn well this is how the game is played

1097
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,159
On sublevel conspiracy theorists know that the

1098
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,183
Kindling

1099
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Keep their fires alive

1100
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Naturally deplete

1101
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
Grows old after awhile

1102
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
Engaged

1103
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,447
Route to firefresh New novelty

1104
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
This strategy

1105
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:54,335
If only we got X then our questions will be answered and we stop this s***

1106
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
Is it true as a two-pronged strategy

1107
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
Provide to that new novel

1108
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
On the water

1109
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
Grandiose

1110
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
Grandiosity

1111
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
To get people to release the thing that you want them to

1112
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
So you can calm through it

1113
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
Renew Novelties or after

1114
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
That generally doesn't

1115
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,767
Sent the police don't make the decisions based on whether or not something shuts up

1116
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
But he does

1117
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Matter

1118
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,911
Because that's really more of a Hail Mary and they're not really expecting that to happen

1119
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,775
This strategy automatically

1120
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Because it allows people

1121
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
We've made it clear that we would shut up if they just released this

1122
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
We have our question and they won't they won't provide the

1123
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
Evidence

1124
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,855
That would make it all go away and that that

1125
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
It becomes itself pornography

1126
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
Did they need to keep the fire alive

1127
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
It's a manipulative strategy

1128
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
And is loads of both

1129
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Are you

1130
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
Stevie sorts of techniques being used

1131
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
Hibbetts contacts without being like

1132
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Come on man

1133
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,727
You know what you're doing

1134
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
So

1135
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
Here we get

1136
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
Into the next

1137
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
Piece of

1138
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Sandy Hook

1139
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,127
Secrecy the James

1140
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
To pitch

1141
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,199
Unquestioning

1142
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Paul doesn't

1143
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,807
Doesn't push back really at all

1144
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
Say that s*** on air

1145
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:14,207
But of course as you know there's also the CVS footage of a bystander

1146
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,983
In the front seat

1147
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Optical

1148
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Initially from December 14th

1149
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,695
First of all

1150
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,023
I'm never saying who actually was

1151
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,631
Suspicious

1152
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,935
All death of that particular medium

1153
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,751
SunTrust

1154
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Explanation

1155
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
In the woods were

1156
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,223
Because that's all been cleaned up my mess

1157
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
Trust them because of

1158
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:11,807
Retraction

1159
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Made which end

1160
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Their coverage is

1161
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,903
If any if any news Outlet

1162
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Ever makes

1163
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719
You know you can never

1164
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
I think that's how it works

1165
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,887
The shooting storywood

1166
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,191
Sprung

1167
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:32,031
But they couldn't have gotten a quote from her because she was one of people killed at

1168
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:38,943
The be retracted quote and apologized in early online reports from the scene of the December 14th shootings at

1169
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Sandy Hook Elementary

1170
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,551
Preschool identify herself to our reporter is the principle of

1171
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
The school that woman is not the schools

1172
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
Principal Dawn hochsprung

1173
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
Who was killed in the Friday morning at

1174
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,719
Apologize for

1175
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Confusion may have caused

1176
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
Bad sucker

1177
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,423
The simplest explanation is

1178
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Severely Rush

1179
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
Journalist

1180
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
Stories out before 8

1181
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Fact checker

1182
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,919
Or if you need a bad person to blame maybe it was a bison

1183
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
Who is in shock

1184
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,479
Who misrepresented herself.

1185
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
To be involved in the story

1186
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Possible

1187
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,135
Free online

1188
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
Receive it's being sold

1189
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,999
I would even accept that it's entirely possible that it was

1190
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
Another administrator

1191
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
The school

1192
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,119
Communication of the reporter assumed it was

1193
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:35,007
Principal

1194
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
To become a Target

1195
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,871
Might not want

1196
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
To bring someone else into this

1197
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Easier

1198
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:49,087
Retraction

1199
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,879
The person writing

1200
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
The story was

1201
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
Thinking about her wealth

1202
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
Thinking about the clip-ins

1203
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Just wrote it down

1204
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
Mixing up their notes

1205
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:02,655
Especially under the immediacy

1206
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,191
The time crunch Express

1207
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
Andy was a

1208
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
Tragedy

1209
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
Ultimately

1210
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,871
It's very weird

1211
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Kind of

1212
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,223
It has the vibe of a mistake made under intense

1213
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,783
Tracy isn't saying you just

1214
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Distrust them as a source

1215
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
Skizzy domanski

1216
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Consistency

1217
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Thorough

1218
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,159
Checking from the media

1219
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
I know that because he's on f****** Infowars

1220
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,767
He says that because this

1221
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,327
Which direction does one of the big early pieces of evidence

1222
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
Conspiracy theorists

1223
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
Is the poster there claims

1224
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,399
No one died

1225
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
So that's what he's doing

1226
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
Lisa Veterinary

1227
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Because they got a quote

1228
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
From somebody who is dead

1229
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Ripley dead nobody Acts

1230
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
God you guys

1231
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Here's another piece of his stupid

1232
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Suspicions

1233
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,783
I would say that you should

1234
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
Critical

1235
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
This is dumb

1236
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
Also questions with regards to the

1237
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,071
The alleged photograph

1238
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:09,471
Students that were being evacuated

1239
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,799
National and international news

1240
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,991
Associate

1241
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,047
And yet only two photographs emerged from that series of

1242
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:40,191
Is this the best you've got like you're on a national platform and this is what you've got

1243
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,495
Like do you not understand that maybe she didn't

1244
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
Get clearance to publish pictures of people

1245
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
Like

1246
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,359
There are exclamation

1247
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
That are simple or

1248
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
She just thought these were the best

1249
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:55,551
Does a bunch

1250
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,367
If you get headshots

1251
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,671
They take a lot more

1252
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
Then to

1253
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
Let's true but they only give you

1254
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
Exactly what do they do with all those

1255
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,911
Maybe like my

1256
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
First rebuttal might be a little bit

1257
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
It's a week

1258
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,799
I don't know

1259
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,359
Public

1260
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
You don't have to get there

1261
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,199
Information I think I do believe it

1262
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
That's the case in most States

1263
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
But if it's

1264
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
You chose to

1265
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Couple

1266
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
Who gives a f***

1267
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
Yeah you got to do better

1268
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:38,559
That's not suspicious at all

1269
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:42,655
For a photo essay later maybe you saved the rest for coffee table book

1270
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,495
Deeply disturbing

1271
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,287
Any of these things are possible

1272
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,687
Maybe they only had room for two in the copy

1273
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
Not unlimited space endeavor

1274
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,551
Stripers

1275
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,391
This is 2012 is it before Squarespace man

1276
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:07,999
Dragon drop

1277
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,303
X

1278
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
So in his next clip he brings up

1279
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,911
Completely absurd

1280
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
Conspiracy about Sandy Hook

1281
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
And then says something

1282
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
They broke this

1283
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
Wide open

1284
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,359
In a wave that I think Alex

1285
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:27,199
Deep trouble I love

1286
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
Did you hear about that report

1287
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,591
The first time that it's an emergency really Ama

1288
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
Avenue

1289
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,919
Really

1290
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319
Explicitly

1291
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
The Alex Jones Show

1292
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
I might not have breath

1293
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,743
Recall but I do not remember Alex covering fleeing danzo

1294
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
But

1295
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,911
Nuns were comforting survivors and people on the scene and they were wearing

1296
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,703
Shoes that people online

1297
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
Think look right for none

1298
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
Too comfortable for none

1299
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:29,407
A bunch people started posting they were like police

1300
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:36,063
Okay alright alright

1301
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,927
Them are interested in that narrative

1302
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
What's more important

1303
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,535
First heard this on the Alex Jones Show

1304
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,095
I because I decided to look around a little bit

1305
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
I thought a really strange overlook

1306
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,703
Of James Tracy's coverage of Sandy Hook

1307
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
One thing that I find particularly in

1308
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:00,127
Is it the first time the Tracy covered Sandy Hook on his blog was December 20th 2012

1309
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
6 days after the shooting

1310
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Hello

1311
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,479
From the section where he's discussing

1312
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Contradiction

1313
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
The official report

1314
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
Bob story

1315
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:14,207
Several independent researchers and most recently infowars.com reporter Rob to have over the pass

1316
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,999
When did the evidence

1317
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,607
Sandy Hook shooting suspects were apprehended by police

1318
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
In that same post

1319
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
He includes a quote about how journalists

1320
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,727
Dictate how people

1321
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
Experience

1322
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
They set the stage

1323
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:32,639
They conveyed to the public to meeting and atmosphere at essence of the whole event

1324
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,711
For anything

1325
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
Intrude on this

1326
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
From John Rappaport

1327
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
Frequent Infowars guest

1328
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,135
And forth our house

1329
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,183
Every single citation that isn't

1330
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Straight coverage

1331
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
From AP or

1332
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
CBS ABC or Fox

In the notes section

1334
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
Of this post

1335
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,887
The first time that he covered Sandy Hook on his blog

1336
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,703
Is a direct link to an Infowars contributor

1337
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:01,567
Jon rappoport in my catoms are listed as sources to James Tracey

1338
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
First article

1339
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,151
What are you started questioning Sandy Hook

1340
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
I hate you

1341
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
You beautiful

1342
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
That's f***** up stuff

1343
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,695
That you found that at all is a

1344
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
Fired Pizza

1345
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,863
There's no information that you

1346
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,911
Makes me angry on such

1347
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
Go home

1348
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
And just like

1349
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,871
Press myself in between two walls

1350
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Make sure that I'm okay

1351
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
I think it starts

1352
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,967
Explain why Rob lawsuit

1353
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
Yeah

1354
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
To be an open question before

1355
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,111
So there's a little bit more here

1356
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:50,719
December 24th traits

1357
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,071
This was supposed that included the suggestion that

1358
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
Enquirer weather

1359
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
Sandy Hook

1360
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
That's okay quotes

1361
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Sister

1362
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,615
Just to take us back real quick

1363
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
Anybody who uses

1364
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
Is the word Sapulpa

1365
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,271
Call Jon Rappaport

1366
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,807
December 24th

1367
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,599
Posted

1368
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Inquire

1369
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Weather is

1370
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
No Diggity

1371
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,047
Statement by saying

1372
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,607
With the exception of an unusual and apparently

1373
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,167
Contrived appearance by Emily Parker's alleged

1374
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
Father

1375
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Family members have been most

1376
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
From public scrutiny

1377
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,079
Because of course that's his child

1378
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
Just murdered about a week ago name

1379
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
A bunch of

1380
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Scrutiny

1381
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
My friend is

1382
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Is it healthy

1383
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
It's worth noting that

1384
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,575
First mention of Robbie Parker on James Tracey

1385
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,207
Alex it suggested that he seems to be investigated on his own show on December 9th

1386
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,999
Days prior

1387
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,047
To Tracy ever bring him up

1388
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:02,143
Interesting Lee this post Tracy made again

1389
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,447
Herbalist

1390
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:08,287
Radioman911 and Idaho picker

1391
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,079
Just people who have YouTube

1392
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,407
Alright by January 4th Tracy was a

1393
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
Explicitly discussing crisis actor

1394
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
Quote

1395
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,527
After such a heroine event

1396
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,319
Would be family members and students

1397
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:24,159
It's lingering in the area and repeated of the offering themselves for interview

1398
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
Possible reasons there

1399
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,023
Is working under the direction of federal authorities

1400
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Incoordination

1401
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Cable and broadcast networks Allen

1402
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
That realistically drives home the event stretch

1403
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
In the post

1404
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
Tracy goes on to

1405
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,151
Is it possible that such actors were utilized

1406
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
Effective public opinion

1407
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,991
With the exception of police and government officials

1408
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Coshocton

1409
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Restrictions

1410
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,135
Family members and pedestrians captured and photos from the shooting's aftermath her almost

1411
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Entirely anonymous

1412
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,975
That is where he would fall back on the

1413
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Defense of Iowa

1414
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
Questions

1415
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
When you put forth

1416
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
Do you like that

1417
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
But this is also where that argument

1418
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
If you're just asking

1419
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
The question

1420
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
With justification

1421
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
Super Why the answer

1422
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
That question is

1423
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Use

1424
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,711
Is it possible that such actor for utilized in

1425
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
Newtown

1426
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Control the event

1427
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:26,367
Blah blah

1428
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Defend

1429
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
The affirmative

1430
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Do you know

1431
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,279
We do provide a Counterpoint to balances out life possible

1432
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
The question is

1433
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
No they didn't

1434
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
Then you question is just a rhetorical device

1435
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
Using to make your point while hiding behind a question

1436
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Tracy doesn't

1437
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,799
Provide the side

1438
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,127
But he does go on to say of a child who survived

1439
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
Shooting

1440
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
The frequent hazardous

1441
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,247
Hesitancy with words in the child's delivery

1442
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,439
Adjust they coached

1443
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
Present memorized

1444
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,071
I'm not being clear enough of the James Tracy 100

1445
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Recite was not in

1446
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
Just asking a question

1447
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,655
January 4th

1448
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Here is his

1449
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Conclusion

1450
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
In the post

1451
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Quote

1452
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
To declare that the shooting never took place

1453
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
Is cause for intense opprobrium

1454
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,199
In fashion

1455
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
Historicizing

1456
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,039
Will believe Maine

1457
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Terrible writing

1458
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,719
Furious at all of the sentences and words people are using

1459
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
Stanford

1460
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,303
Trance will maintain

Silverlake

01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:47,263
Similar operation in Oklahoma City

1463
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:53,663
Osama Bin Laden was not responsible for the events of 9/11 in the World Trade Center towers

1464
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
Vigorously

1465
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
Condemned For Thought crimes against the state

1466
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
Such are the immense

1467
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,807
Dimensions of mass manipulation

1468
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Spit the motive

1469
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Design

1470
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,255
Buck Barger apparatus of social NGO political control

1471
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,279
Okay

1472
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Like

1473
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
That's a rant

1474
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
Let me describe that

1475
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
As best I can

1476
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,495
What you just read

1477
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Was

1478
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
A

1479
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
Used

1480
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Stock

1481
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
That was just

1482
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
That was

1483
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,271
Tremendously

1484
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,927
If you express

1485
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Get the idea that

1486
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:42,303
He's accusing people who think it happened to being under orwellian mind

1487
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,607
Control asking questions

1488
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Consistency

1489
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
Was posted 2 weeks

1490
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,495
Before this interview with Paul Joseph Watson

1491
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,055
This is the sort of thing that he's putting out into the world

1492
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,383
So f*** him

1493
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,919
So not only

1494
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,735

1497
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Yep

1498
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,599
Then

1499
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
He is

1500
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Used as a

Infowars

1504
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:20,959
Maybe not as extensively as at the beginning it was mostly in Fort Worth

1505
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
It seemed to be informing

1506
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
More people pick up on it

1507
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,359
He has more Lakes

1508
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,175

Organization

1510
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:37,087
Is Infowars putting out an air

1511
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,623
One of their listeners

1512
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,671
Running as far as fast

1513
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
They came with that.

1514
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,767
Then Infowars graciously pulling them back in

1515
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,559
The fold

1516
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
We run as far with you

1517
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,239
Also allows them to be the shield

1518
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,455
Does a tenured professor

1519
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,527
The credibility with these dumb.

1520
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,135
You also had some people who were coming to his defense

1521
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:16,767
On February 24th he posted an open letter supporting his indefensible coverage of Sandy Hook

1522
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,559
From a very likely source

1523
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,375
Tracy's defense

1524
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:26,751
Which ekspresno literal Holocaust denier and would go on to write the book no one died

1525
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,991
By December 2013 Don fully off the deep end it was posting articles about how many of the children killed at

1526
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,807
The shooting with Jennifer Hudson

1527
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,367
It's Super Bowl

1528
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
XLVII

1529
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
I don't know how to read roman numerals quickly

1530
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
XLVII

1531
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Good

1532
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
He didn't get saying

1533
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,167
It's not a great use of my time to read every little thing Tracy

1534
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,983
He is ever written on his blog leave it there

1535
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,031
The timeline of his b*******

1536
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:05,663
However it's interesting to note that is earliest coverage of the tragedy used Infowars Rob do in Mike Adams

1537
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Explicitly

1538
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,759
When Alex is getting sued for his coverage in the present day

1539
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,343
His doctor phone says that he was just reporting on what Wolfgang halbig

1540
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,879
A professor Tracy recover

1541
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,695
Wolfgang halbig isn't even in play yet

1542
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,463
If you look at

1543
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,255
The fact

1544
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
He was covering

1545
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,583
Was inspired by what Alex

1546
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
Alex by pointing the finger at crazy

1547
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,471
Is it many ways actually pointed the finger at themselves

1548
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
But most people don't realize that

1549
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
So

1550
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,175
Interesting wrinkle to the story that

1551
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,479
We're not ignored but not realized

1552
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,759
I think was going to have

1553
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
Put out a video

1554
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
10.6

1555
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Million views

1556
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,231
Things like totally

1557
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,255
Six million views

1558
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
Crazy conspiracy

1559
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,631
You only get a few people who listen

1560
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
It's not right

1561
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,751
I think I think

1562
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Your dynamic

1563
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
2

1564
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,431
It does open up a whole lot of

1565
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,479
Doors and windows in terms of

1566
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
Alex

1567
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
Urea

1568
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Yeah

1569
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Before

1570
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,487
Crazy made it clear by saying I heard that on Infowars

1571
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Which

1572
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:29,375
Just for posterity

1573
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,679
Before they got to that they were talking about

1574
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:37,055
With Nixon during these tapes alfredo

1575
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Next clip

1576
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
F****** hilarious

1577
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,183
Police office

1578
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Definitely

1579
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:22,367
So you see the dichotomy questions

1580
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
That you have been

1581
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
Presenting

1582
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,463
Those are 100%

1583
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,791
That we should consider.

1584
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,863
Let's talk about some of the Wilder.

1585
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,055
D

1586
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
You have to

1587
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,151
Is that when is interviews happen

1588
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,807
They know who James Tracey is they know what he's been putting out to the world

1589
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:56,671
There's no real interview without bringing up the idea

1590
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,719
If that is why Paul keeps

1591
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
I don't believe in

1592
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Mini series

1593
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
Inoculating cell from any blowback

1594
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,863
Doesn't this next

1595
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,655
The way he said

1596
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Catsup

1597
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
The question

1598
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
Daddy's going to

1599
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,495
Introduce

1600
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,287
The conversation

1601
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:15,104
Is the question in such a strong

1602
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Fashion

1603
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
But I don't believe

1604
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
You would do

1605
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
Unless you were trying to get people

1606
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
To think

1607
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,552
But he was much more rational than you

1608
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
Hey Becky I mean

1609
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,272
I think that there is definitely a program

1610
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
Misinformation

1611
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,904
Supreme information in order to

1612
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
The waters

1613
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
Discredit

1614
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Research

1615
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
Media

1616
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,288
Because

1617
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,944
If you can just

1618
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,808
So is Watson setting up that question

1619
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,624
The perfect way to allow someone to misrepresent their position

1620
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:35,488
He doesn't want to directly ask him at this point if he believes that some of the victims were actors

1621
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,280
Because that would require a follow-up

1622
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,304
He doesn't want

1623
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,840
Specifically what the

1624
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,424
UT Direct

1625
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:46,240
Stand on the show unchallenged

1626
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,056
Like a f****** a******

1627
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Like what victim

1628
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
Are actors

1629
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,200
What evidence do you have to say something like that

1630
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
The strawman

1631
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,344
Play thing is actually Tony Hawk

1632
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,624
That allows the

1633
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Middle Ground

1634
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
It's his way of mainstreaming

1635
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,488
Professor Tracy's completely insane argument

1636
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:11,072
Did you form that's way more acceptable to the broader Infowars audio

1637
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
It really seems to me like a

1638
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
Lithium is a credible

1639
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,776
If you're not following what I mean

1640
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
This is what it is

1641
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
He doesn't ask Tracy about the beliefs

1642
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
But he has a spouse

1643
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,920
He asked him about the eve

1644
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Even crazier things

1645
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,504
Is the people on YouTuber saying

1646
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,600
Because he frames the question by asking about other

1647
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
Crazy

1648
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,048
Question this way that provides

1649
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,656
Paul Joseph Watson allows trade

1650
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,424
Beside himself

1651
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,448
Apart from those p

1652
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
Sirius online

1653
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,544
I have a hard time believing that this is an

1654
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,616
Particularly coming from someone who like Paul history

1655
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,920
He doesn't believe in the crisis actor theories

1656
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
Which Tracy has a

1657
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,480
Explicitly been pushing at this

1658
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,760
Do you know

1659
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
What

1660
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
More than any

1661
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
Victory Brewing

1662
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,392
This is not our

1663
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
Normal in

1664
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
Infowars

1665
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
104

1666
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,512
Scary Terry

1667
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,840
Calls trying

1668
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,376
A little

1669
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,960
A little while he's at least say

1670
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
Crying so hard

1671
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,104
There is a part of it comes from

1672
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,896
Personal preservation

1673
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:29,920
To an extent

1674
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:33,248
But Paul doesn't have to repeatedly say I don't believe this

1675
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
Lease to his credit

1676
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Yeah but that's

1677
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,184
She's talking about

1678
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,488
Dumb f*** who she doesn't like anymore

1679
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,816
Information

1680
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,424
Discrediting all of us out here explained

1681
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
There are similarities

1682
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,336
Please I would say to this

1683
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
It's more

1684
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Because

1685
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
Like for the company

1686
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,904
It's from It app

1687
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
It feels

1688
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
Like an interview that would go differently if it was being done

1689
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,328
Sincerely

1690
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,608
I don't believe this

1691
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,376
I think that it

1692
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
You know these people actually are victims of this

1693
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
It's awful

1694
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,264
I don't think this conversation

1695
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,848
Person who sang things Tracy is posting on his blog

1696
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,128
I don't think it would go

1697
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
I don't drink it

1698
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,016
I don't think if you was operating from a sincere place would be like

1699
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:41,600
Now there's a lot of people who say that he's crazy

1700
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,000
Real journalism research Lake

1701
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,072
Yeah cuz it allows him to present

1702
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
I don't

1703
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
That

1704
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
The intent comes out

1705
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
These questions

1706
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
Will base their conclusion

1707
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,384
Seems like the average

1708
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
Income in this county is

1709
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
Is pretty high so

1710
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,248
The security system must be

1711
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
Top-of-the-line

1712
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,904
Journalist

1713
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,440
They just really like to reasonable

1714
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,744
Conclude payouts

1715
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
Text Cliff

1716
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,376
Admire

1717
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,424
Just bought them

1718
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
He's talking to

1719
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:58,656
We need to trade

1720
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,472
I agree with that but unfortunately

1721
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,944
Literally personally harassed

1722
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,040
She hasn't reached the point that he would eventually get to

1723
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:18,112
Literally suggesting

1724
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,416
Exact same strategy

1725
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
Discussed with the surveillance

1726
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,840
Brewvies or no

1727
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
Yo I'm going to use the fact

1728
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,656
You won't give me

1729
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:34,240
A crazy person

1730
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,544
I'm going to use the factory

1731
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
He isn't your son

1732
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,944
Tracy wouldn't reach that level of crazy and abusive

1733
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,736
But that doesn't mean he wasn't doing some

1734
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
Real damage to Victor

1735
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,344
Call Joseph

1736
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
Yeah

1737
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,184
Melania trying to End online

1738
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Really

1739
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,768
Really

1740
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Your f******

1741
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:04,192
Just a few months after this appearance he was reprimanded by Florida Atlantic University

1742
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:07,264
Sufficiently disassociating his personal blog from the University

1743
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,824
Reasons for his eventual firing

1744
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,640
Heather

1745
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,712
Blog on your personal time

1746
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
You must stop dragging

1747
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,296
Florida Atlantic University

1748
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
Personal endeavors

1749
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:23,904
Position as a credit

1750
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,696
Infowars interview

1751
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,256
Exactly the sort of thing that the school wasn't

1752
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
Because

1753
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
Planes quotes

1754
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
Your actions could

1755
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,656
Adversely affected legitimate interest

1756
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
To the university

1757
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
And constitute

1758
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
He was so deeply on the this s*** is fake thing

1759
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,824
From early on

1760
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,848
Like he definitely was

1761
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,408
In December 2012 he wrote quote

1762
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:51,040
Outrageous claim Hook shooting ever took place

1763
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
Dash Dash

1764
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,880
At least in the way law enforcement authorities

1765
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
As I

1766
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:02,560
That's the slimiest possible to play this game

1767
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:03,840
First

1768
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
He couches the point in the languages

1769
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,144
Suggestion

1770
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,912
One is left

1771
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Inquire

1772
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,960
It's such b*******

1773
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,312
It's equivalent to that dumb joke I'm asking for a friend

1774
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,664
Or how about sometime present the question by saying inquiring-minds-want-to-know

1775
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,200
I'm doing it as a joke

1776
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:19,968
He's doing

1777
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,296
It's a way of saying something inflammatory without having to own the

1778
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:28,416
The second thing it would erode their with that that's

1779
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,488
That is a mess

1780
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,280
Is the placement of a Double Dash

1781
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,584
He knows that his readers will disregard

1782
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,400
Comes after the part where you at

1783
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,728
They're just going to run with the primary assertion he's driving

1784
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008
People towards which is this

1785
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Never happened

1786
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,080
He sings What is love

1787
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,384
Inquire whether or not

1788
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,016
AP saying that in the weeks after

1789
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,040
After the tragedy

1790
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
Easy is it to jump

1791
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,904
From there to one is left to inquire claim

1792
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
Affected by this all are liars

1793
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
It's a super easy pivot for

1794
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,256
Conspiracy theorist

1795
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
And a whole lot of his listeners

1796
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,840
Unfollowers did exactly

1797
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,240
Before he began directly harassing victims families

1798
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264
You didn't stop

1799
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,080
He wrote an article on his website on October 15th

1800
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
26

1801
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
Entitled

1802
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,944
Fraudster Lenny Posner Target

1803
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
Mhbs memory hole blog

1804
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:25,760
Is website

1805
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:29,344
Of course this was after Tracy it aggressively targeted

1806
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
Posner

1807
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,136
Who wrote December

1808
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:31,904
1020

1809
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
In the Orlando

1810
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,512
Tracy is among those who

1811
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,816
We sought to cause our family pain and anguish

1812
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Publicly demonizing art

1813
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,632
Ski party

1814
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,912
Photos of our slaves

1815
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,192
From falling into the hands of

1816
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,312
Tracy even sent as a certified letter demanding proof that Noah wants live

1817
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,896
Where is parents and then we were the rightful owner of these photographic images

1818
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,688
We found this outrageous

1819
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,992
Police report for harassment

1820
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,552
Once Tracy realize we would not respond

1821
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,112
He subjected us to ridicule and contempt on his blog

1822
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:05,184
Boasting to his readers that the unfulfilled request was

1823
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,488
Because we use the copyright claim

1824
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,792
To support continued Research into the

1825
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
Sandy Hook massacre of

1826
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,608
It means nothing

1827
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Paul Joseph Watson

1828
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,448
Pretend to take The High Ground to be against people harassing the victim

1829
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,800
What is offering a large be friendly and non-confrontational platform

1830
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
Play song the seed

1831
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,920
But inspired many of his followers

1832
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,736
And would go on to be one of the most disgraceful harassers

1833
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,504
Himself

1834
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,040
Intellectual coward

1835
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
On full display

1836
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,392
Who would see that coming

1837
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
Step from these

1838
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
These

1839
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,280
Pillar

1840
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
Encourage

1841
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,240
Desire to fight back against the powers-that-be

1842
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
I mean if

1843
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,312
You hear their bumpers coming in and out of

1844
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
Commercials

1845
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,616
You know that they stand up for truth

1846
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
R-Truth

1847
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,200
I can't imagine

1848
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
Shrink

1849
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Legal

1850
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,112
So earlier Paul ask a question about Christ

1851
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,792
Didn't want to have any follow-up

1852
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
He didn't know what he was going to

1853
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,376
Now a little bit later in the interview

1854
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656
You directly.

1855
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,192
About crisis

1856
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,240
And Tracy's beliefs about that

1857
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,544
And I think I can explain why he decided

1858
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,456
Which of all people

1859
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,064
Crisis

1860
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,440
Surrounding

1861
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,608
This is why we probably

1862
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:54,240
Based out of

1863
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,800
Denver Colorado

1864
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:03,456
Department of Homeland Security

1865
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:10,112
Alvin playing the roles of bystanders

1866
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,512
RV

1867
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,936
Social media

1868
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,592
In creating an environment

1869
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,784
Drill

1870
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,576
School

1871
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,368
For disabled children in Harlem

1872
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,048
It's not known whether or not

1873
01:32:54,912 --> 01:33:00,032
By the crisis actors

1874
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
Cumbiamba in the mainstream media radar

1875
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,640
And quote

1876
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:11,040
Qualify

1877
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:16,160
From his organization in Colorado

1878
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:18,720
To conclude no it's not that

1879
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,000
Crisis actors

1880
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:23,584
Ergo

1881
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,352
Everything

1882
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
Actors were there

1883
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:28,960
What made him think

1884
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,104
I think this shoot is so weak

1885
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,432
I bet this is going to be slam dunk

1886
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:41,504
Evidence it's so insane to hear people like

1887
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
Even in a friendly environment

1888
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,344
Try and explain what made them

1889
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
These things

1890
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,232
Cuz it's like if you just listen to it it's always so much more disappointing than you kind of

1891
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,792
What you hope it's a better story than

1892
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Event

1893
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:03,264
So a drill

1894
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:18,880
We know that they were actors belongings

1895
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
It's just how we talk

1896
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:43,456
Okay

1897
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
Maybe what you say is correct

1898
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:09,824
Interview

1899
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:14,432
But that's one of the reasons that I actually put that for

1900
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,480
Of their being

1901
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
Crisis actor

1902
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:20,064
The most controversial

1903
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:30,048
That's a super lame explanation for why you believe they were

1904
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,608
Boron

1905
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,888
F*** you

1906
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,656
That's it

1907
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:37,728
Yeah starting with

1908
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:43,104
Is your explanation

1909
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,896
I mean whenever I look at pics

1910
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Pictures and I'm always like

1911
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,016
Call Matt if this was a crisis there be more people there

1912
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Reasonable aim for convince

1913
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:02,304
You see here that's all just bought a did end up asking him about that

1914
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
From earlier still staying

1915
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Aftermath

1916
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,776
Albertino's

1917
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,312
Furious at the topic doesn't

1918
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
Who's the best strategy

1919
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:20,480
He asked Tracy about the crisis actors idea but

1920
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,784
Before hard out to a commercial

1921
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,600
Knowing that Tracy's answer is going to be at least long enough

1922
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
To get to the commercial break

1923
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:30,208
Is Don in the middle of

1924
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,536
And say that they needed to go to break no need for a difficult follow-up

1925
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:38,656
He buys himself minutes of time during the commercial breaks come up with a way to respond that preserves

1926
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,960
The possibility of Crisis actors being used

1927
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,264
While also preserving the aloof

1928
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
Between himself

1929
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,848
And someone who would say something like that

1930
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,384
He said himself a perfect

1931
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
Play prick

1932
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,968
I believe this plays out

1933
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
Because when they come back

1934
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,064
From commercial Paul at has realized

1935
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:56,832
Swingrail

1936
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,624
And gives out

1937
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,232
Professor

1938
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
We have people

1939
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
On the ground

1940
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:22,432
Into the official story so I guess

1941
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:28,832
Talking about

1942
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:35,488
Yes that's correct

1943
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,288
Medias

1944
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:59,552
Want it was merely a question

1945
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
Actually

1946
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,984
F****** right

1947
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,008
Tons of people

1948
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,056
Jerk off onto a typewriter

1949
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
Because they're they're just

1950
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Because they already

1951
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
You know what it is they

1952
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,480
And they're so excited

1953
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
To say that

1954
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
We heard that defense

1955
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
Alex

1956
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:43,840
Bucking guy who you're pointing finger right now

1957
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,120
He's asking

1958
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
Mean question

1959
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,520
And that's why I'm

1960
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,824
Sending letters demanding DNA

1961
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,176
The interview is pretty boring stuff and a lot of the stuff that

1962
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:59,712
He's covered already so if

1963
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,760
Be kind of laborious to go through it

1964
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:05,856
Like you talked about how the story changed when the conference

1965
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,208
Or were there an accurate early reports from

1966
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:14,304
Immediate information like there isn't any of these situations

1967
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,584
He says that he doesn't trust

1968
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,400
The medical examiner because he had a bad press conference

1969
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:23,264
And that's why you started to doubt

1970
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,336
This is so weak

1971
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,872
Bulshit

1972
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,176
I can't believe

1973
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,456
This person

1974
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,736
Is this

1975
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,088
Everything

1976
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:42,208
Best he can in order to make him

1977
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
Not look like a

1978
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:50,144
He rehabbed the ideas

1979
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:59,616
You're saying that they were there to massage the narrator

1980
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,176
F*************** died

1981
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:02,944
Albion Act

1982
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,224
Yeah it seems like

1983
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:11,136
That is made my mood very

1984
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:11,904
Sapulpa

1985
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,488
Where's the jovial

1986
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,280
Here's the jovial and theranos

1987
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,144
Okay we really appreciate your time and questions

1988
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
Thankful

1989
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,640
Raising questions about the Sunday

1990
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,016
Even surprise me

1991
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:44,416
Crazy inside

1992
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
Call Michelle

1993
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,168
Good luck

1994
01:40:55,424 --> 01:41:00,032
Punzel videos

1995
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:17,440
Cuz he's not going to be able to walk that much better job

1996
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,232
Performance

1997
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
Did it

1998
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:25,120
Good

1999
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
The worst thing possible

2000
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:31,008
Could not have gone worse if

2001
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:35,616
Present

2002
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,920
She probably just want to talk all about gun

2003
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
That's also true

2004
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,760
The first two hours

2005
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,808
Of the shower

2006
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,600
For the show

2007
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,160
Mike Adams takes over the second

2008
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Health Ranger Mike

2009
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,512
Yes boy the reason

2010
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
Is because he also had a big

2011
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Guest

2012
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:02,240
Cam filling in for Alex today

2013
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:08,896
Joining me now for the rest

2014
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:16,320
No no no

2015
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:20,160
I told you

2016
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,184
I told you

2017
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,512
I told you what

2018
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,352
I told you this terrible

2019
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:32,704
Completely

2020
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:38,336
Because you have that power over all of her

2021
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:41,152
This is so bizarre

2022
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,456
Because I'm looking through these four

2023
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
And Alex's

2024
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:54,208
Harrison weirdos

2025
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:57,536
Is going on in the middle of it he says tomorrow we're going to get into Sandy Hook

2026
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:01,376
ITune in the next day Paul Joseph Watson interview

2027
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,448
Pretty f***** up this is a whole episode

2028
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,496
As it goes on

2029
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,312
F****** Mike Adams shows up with Andrew Wakefield

2030
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,360
We cannot talk about this.

2031
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,688
It's crazy

2032
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:21,088
Yeah pretty weird started this show and we were like literally

2033
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
Crazy

2034
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:24,928
I barely remember

2035
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:29,024
Seduction

2036
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,560
Do this pile of s***

2037
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
Skin wars

2038
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
Thailicious

2039
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,912
Garbage motherfuker

2040
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,496
Viewed as an expert on

2041
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,848
With the possible exception of him being an excellent subject

2042
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,896
About the subjective experience of having

2043
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:49,760
And countless

2044
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:54,880
In February 1998 Wakefield Rhode a research paper was published in the medical journal

2045
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
Journal Lancet

2046
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:03,840
Artemis Children's Hospital between July 96

2047
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,656
In February 1997 presenting with bowel issue

2048
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:09,216
Let's remember the sample size is 12

2049
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:14,080
Is paper alleged the two-thirds of the children experienced

2050
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,408
Which is to say for example language skills that were there

2051
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,944
Before we're actually lost

2052
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Send the child

2053
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,040
Asserted that many of these symptoms were seen within 40

2054
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,600
Has mumps and rubella shot

2055
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,880
With the average being

2056
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,416
Point three days after the

2057
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:33,536
Cosby severe immediate backlash against vaccines

2058
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:37,120
Impossible to put into words

2059
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,960
Public trust was eroded the anti-vaccination movement previously

2060
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,752
Completely Fringe phenomenon

2061
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:46,848
Became more mainstream and embolden and Safeguard the Public Public

2062
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
Help were Jeopardy

2063
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,968
His claims began to take hold in the UK where he was

2064
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
But

2065
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:54,784
States in the year to

2066
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,064
2006

2067
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,624
MMR vaccine

2068
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,440
With an alleged quote epidemic of autism

2069
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
The anti-vax crowd in the United

2070
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
It states started

2071
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
Some serious move

2072
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:09,120
It would be want to study

2073
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,400
I need actually found evidence

2074
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:12,192
Vaccine

2075
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
With his bowels

2076
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,264
Condition that quote

2077
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:16,544
But

2078
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,104
Come out his work was not above board

2079
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,664
I want to study only involve 12 chilled

2080
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,480
Which is absurdly small sample size

2081
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:27,808
Subsequent attempts to reproduce the results of

2082
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,600
The study of all failed to arrive same

2083
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Conclusion

2084
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,208
As more and more information about the study and how it was conducted the game to come

2085
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
The surface

2086
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,256
Lancet began retract

2087
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,048
At first retracting the entire

2088
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,608
The study

2089
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,632
Completely retract

2090
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:45,984
The study authors

2091
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,056
With ethical violations as well as scientific

2092
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
Misinterpretation

2093
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,616
So it was all done

2094
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,920
Never got back on

2095
01:45:54,944 --> 01:46:01,088
Three years later on Infowars

2096
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,648
We'll get to that

2097
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:10,304
I hate him he's so much worse than people think

2098
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,584
Cloned human

2099
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:16,960
The embryo not really knock knock.

2100
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,128
Coca-Cola

2101
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
That kind of thing

2102
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
Like I'm not I don't want to

2103
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
Claude the Chinese

2104
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,416
Disappeared

2105
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,696
Consequences

2106
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,744
You think this is Extreme

2107
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,768
Hold on.

2108
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:44,352
According to an investigation done by British journalist Brian

2109
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,400
Deer reported in the British Journal of Medicine

2110
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:50,496
Wakefield failed to disclose

2111
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,520
20 embarked on this

2112
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,664
Put on the payroll of a solicitor Richard bar

2113
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,736
Wakefield 435000

2114
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,272
643 lb

2115
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Plus expense

2116
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,320
Why

2117
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,136
Why would a trial lawyer

2118
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:15,072
According to Dear as part of a scheme whereby Richard bar would be able to begin a massively profitable class action lawsuit against back

2119
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,120
But in order to

2120
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,448
To do that he would need a study to illustrate that there was a causal connection

2121
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,496
Between the onset of this condition

2122
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:24,032
And receiving the vaccine

2123
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,336
Close examination of medical record

2124
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,872
The children included in the study

2125
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,664
Turned up some really really damning

2126
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
Stop

2127
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:33,504
Perhaps the biggest red flag with regarding child

2128
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,552
Whose father spoke with Brian beer

2129
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:40,928
In the study tribe 11 is listed as one of the children whose symptoms happened after getting the MMR shot

2130
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,536
But according to his actual medical records father that is not true

2131
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,352
The symptoms preceded the shot by at least a month

2132
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:52,448
This information is the results

2133
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472
Inclusion

2134
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
Child's 11th Father's Day quote

2135
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:58,336
Please let me know if Andrew Wakefield has his doctor's life

2136
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
Revoked

2137
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,920
His misinterpretation of my son and his research paper is

2138
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,968
Probably go to jail

2139
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:10,368
Another child child to develop symptoms 2 weeks after getting the vaccine but his mother is gone on record

2140
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
He said it was 6 months

2141
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,256
In the case of child ate her general practitioner wrote this a note to wake

2142
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,840
Ignored and included this girl to study anyway

2143
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:24,960
Simply reiterate that both the hospital and members of the primary care team involved

2144
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Had

2145
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
Concerns about developments

2146
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,080
Before she had her MMR shot

2147
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,152
I have to study was scrutinized more problems

2148
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Coming up

2149
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:39,552
I like the fact that one of the children's mothers was a member of a group that campaigned against the MMR

2150
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,856
Are the parents of two of the other children

2151
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,136
People that

2152
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:43,904
New

2153
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,696
Or that another of the parents

2154
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:50,816
I was looking for answers about her child which led to beating someone who connected her with bar

2155
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:53,632
And resulted in her child's inclusion in the study

2156
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:56,704
The sample of 12 children with highly selective

2157
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,752
As opposed to being an anyway science

2158
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,520
Tif example

2159
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:04,384
Lancet study

2160
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,664
To get into all of the

2161
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:06,944
But if you'd like to

2162
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
Is a whole shitload of research

2163
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,040
You can find that lays out almost every element

2164
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,344
This study has the appearance of either being the most

2165
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,112
Incompetent

2166
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,904
Piece of work ever or outright.

2167
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,464
Well that's good that we've got that cleared up

2168
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,864
Sure

2169
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,400
Wake me up in have his medical

2170
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:29,216
He said he was completely discredited

2171
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,520
Subsequent studies which eventually

2172
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:45,600
Get 1,000 or whatever

2173
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,280
We follow the protocols of science have consistently

2174
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:57,120
Right there's no causal relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum

2175
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,936
From sorters but it doesn't matter

2176
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,800
People

2177
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:05,824
He started

2178
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,872
Unimaginable

2179
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
Experian

2180
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:13,760
It's amazing that in 2013 he's on Infowars instead of in a prison

2181
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:16,832
It's presented as a credible voice

2182
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,648
3 years after his daddy had been denounced and retracted

2183
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:23,232
Fully years after the questions about his undisclosed funding work

2184
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
Completely public

2185
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,328
Well after the assessments of the methodology

2186
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,144
Science

2187
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:34,496
More of a farce is that Alex

2188
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,032
He's being interviewed by the f******

2189
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
My cat

2190
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
Is just embarrassed

2191
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,408
Chevy

2192
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:42,944
Also far up is

2193
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,248
Frites

2194
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,552
Gadsden flag

2195
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:59,840
Push back on that before you get too far

2196
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
The interview

2197
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
We have on

2198
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Disgraced science

2199
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,704
That mean wonderful man

2200
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,800
Scammer nope nope

2201
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,336
In the end

2202
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,128
Fitness First

2203
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,176
Of the fact that these

2204
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:17,248
These things about Wakefield or beings

2205
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,064
But it turns out that those

2206
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,704
The British medical journal still has not returned

2207
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:43,104
There's slanderous statements about you and your research

2208
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
Is the key

2209
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
How did that go

2210
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:19,712
Episode in August 2012 Travis County district judge

2211
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:25,088
Bible action against British medical journal straight out of court

2212
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:29,440
This case was thrown out because of course the Texas Court doesn't have jurisdiction for this case

2213
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:33,536
But if you want to know the truth that's exactly why

2214
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,072
Put this case in a Texas Court

2215
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:38,912
Because I get rejected on a technicality

2216
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:43,008
He would prove these monsters have wronged him so badly

2217
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,544
You know how f****** know that

2218
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,432
Well though because it's 2500 the high court of London

2219
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,736
But withdrew that lawsuit voluntarily

2220
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,552
He probably did that because the judge Justice

2221
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,856
ET I was kind of onto his ruse

2222
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,928
Same quote

2223
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:02,208
Extract whatever advantage

2224
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,256
She could from the existence of these proceedings

2225
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,816
Progressed them

2226
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:09,376
Or to give the defendants and opportunity of meeting the clay

2227
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:14,240
She really didn't know her s*** Wakefield agree to pay

2228
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,544
Wakefield agreed to pay beers legal

2229
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,080
Fees when discontinuing the action

2230
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,872
Probably to avoid getting

2231
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,480
So he already tried to do this in London Court

2232
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,808
Where you did have jurisdiction now

2233
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,136
Wakefield to go on to appeal the jurisdiction

2234
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,440
This court

2235
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,208
Texas

2236
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
Disclaims

2237
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,792
Even threatened to take it to the text

2238
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,096
Supreme Court

2239
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,376
These are real

2240
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:47,776
Their PR stunts to create the appearance that look like they're heading towards him is actual

2241
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,568
Study habits be reviewed in court

2242
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,592
He's quick to Rich

2243
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:54,688
His unethical medical behavior is only rivaled by his cowardice

2244
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,016
This is Allah

2245
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,040
Helping him

2246
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:02,880
Laura Loomer needs her money so she can file a lawsuit

2247
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:05,440
Right

2248
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,840
Courtyards cancer

2249
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:20,800
It's been that way for a little while.

2250
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,080
What's more popular of the hustle

2251
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,664
To file a lawsuit

2252
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,688
And really expand

2253
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,480
Go through

2254
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,320
Costly to lose a frivolous

2255
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:34,624
Which all of these people are doing

2256
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,392
Super Lube

2257
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,720
Explain

2258
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:47,680
Increasing

2259
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:51,008
That patience

2260
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,360
And there is a Relentless assault on

2261
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:24,800
For me

2262
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,384
Wakefield's claims is Attack on Titan

2263
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,432
That one is

2264
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,272
Infuriating

2265
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:39,904
Considering he's a walking every moment he draws breath isn't it

2266
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,672
Concepts

2267
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:49,120
You know everyone will be afraid to do controversial research because they lose

2268
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:52,448
Willing to do on the

2269
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,496
Connection between Autism and

2270
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,032
The nation

2271
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:59,872
You're wrong and we're lying all of their work

2272
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,152
Prove that you're wrong

2273
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:03,712
Follow the scientific

2274
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:06,784
Experiment

2275
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
No one cares

2276
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:13,184
Yeah I mean in 2019

2277
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,976
Arkansas love 657

2278
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,512
461 children

2279
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,048
To gauge whether or not there wasn't

2280
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:21,120
Increased autism risk among children who received

2281
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,656
I'm sorry I thought I heard you say

2282
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,824
What was the conclusion that study

2283
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,920
The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not

2284
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:34,688
The restaurant

2285
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,968
Trigger autism

2286
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,992
Susceptible children

2287
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,552
The clustering of autism cases

2288
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,576
After vaccination

2289
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,112
Also there's

2290
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:46,464
Another study published in the New England Journal medicine

2291
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:50,048
530 7303 children

2292
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,328
And concluded

2293
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,656
Hypothesis

2294
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,936
That MMR vaccination

2295
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,520
Or if you prefer American studies there was a 25th

2296
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:02,336
Study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

2297
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:05,408
We're researchers followed 90 5700

2298
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
27 children

2299
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,992
Including 15,000 unvaccinated

2300
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,528
The children observe

2301
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:11,296
Observe

2302
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:13,856
No association between MMR vaccination

2303
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,648
Increase ASD risk

2304
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,184
Even among children with

2305
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,720
Siblings with a F

2306
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:22,048
Cuz William Barr came out after

2307
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,328
Said that

2308
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:26,400
Oh no

2309
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,936
So we know

2310
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,728
Brett Bar

2311
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,008
Again

2312
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,592
I could go on and on but this is the point

2313
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
Conclusion

2314
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,992
Which repeatability

2315
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:43,040
An important feature of the scientific method

2316
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,088
Wakefield results have never been

2317
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:48,672
Repeated explicitly

2318
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
Contradictory result

2319
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,256
He's not a brave scientist under attack

2320
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,792
He's a frog who got caught

2321
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:56,352
Realize his only chance for a future career

2322
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:00,192
Hard into the medical conspiracy theory car man world

2323
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,216
Completely

2324
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:08,384
So might as well might as well go hang out with

2325
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,664

It has made the determination that there is a causal link

2332
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,736
Between vaccinations

2333
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:49,600

2355

3 - c in back

2357
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:26,624
Autism

2358
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,720
Award people money who claimed damages from vaccines causing it

2359
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
However

2360
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,864
That doesn't mean that a child who also has ASD could possibly also have another condition

2361
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,400
It may be covered by the vaccine

2362
02:00:41,216 --> 02:00:41,984
To misinterpret

2363
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:48,640
2nd battalion case that Wakefield to talk about is a bit of a

2364
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:53,248
British

2365
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,320
In July 2012

2366
02:00:56,576 --> 02:01:02,208
A Provincial Court in Rimini Italy

2367
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:06,560
This case is the prime example

2368
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,840
The Backs people

2369
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
Their claims

2370
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,424
The argument

2371
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:16,544
An Italian Court hold up in an American court if they're brave enough to hear the case they say

2372
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:23,712
As it turns out the only evidence presented by the families

2373
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:28,576
And the testimony of an expert witness was relying on the Lancet study for his testimony

2374
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,392
In 2012

2375
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:34,720
Court of appeals and bolonia overturned

2376
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:36,768
Decision in February 2015

2377
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:39,584
Specifically because the evidence introduced was

2378
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,936
Also really shity friend to point out that the Italian case made it so people didn't have to

2379
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:45,216
Get the MMR vaccine

2380
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:48,288
Italy because part of that appeal in 2015

2381
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,568
She noted that after the case

2382
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,360
Vaccination rates drop local

2383
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,128
Clear round ribbon

2384
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:54,688
2015 they had an

2385
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:59,040
85% vaccination rate percent

2386
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:01,088
Is a real-world consequence

2387
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,648
For things like this b******* that microwave

2388
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:04,928
Dangerous

2389
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,208
But they're they're playing with

2390
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:06,976
And they don't

2391
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,280
Don't care about the cops

2392
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,912
Because there is a point at which like if you drop down is vaccination rate too far

2393
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:19,776
They could be

2394
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,312
Real real

2395
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:24,896
I can't imagine

2396
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,432
Empathic nature

2397
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,344
He's still lying he's perfectly why

2398
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,720
Purposefully

2399
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:45,632
The monster of leelai cleats

2400
02:02:54,848 --> 02:03:00,480
Entirely on his discredited study

2401
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,504
Basically

2402
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:07,136
Departs through whenever it takes a little bit of time to

2403
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,416
Disentangled

2404
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:13,024
It's not really all that hard to not wear the manipulation

2405
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,560
Like

2406
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,448
Cities next clip he cites a study

2407
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,472
And I have some

2408
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:28,896
Confidence in vaccines

2409
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:32,480
In a recent study from University of Michigan

2410
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:44,256
Found

2411
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
So

2412
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,936
I can't find the study that matches up with what wakefield's describing but I imagined

2413
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
Close study.

2414
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,776
But if it does I'll bet anything

2415
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
Interpreting what parental

2416
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:57,824
Concern me

2417
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,896
Concerned about vaccine

2418
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:04,224
If I would believe that's true but not the interpretation

2419
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:04,992
He's giving

2420
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,552
Regardless I was able to find the University of

2421
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,600
Michigan study from 2011 so it's just

2422
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:12,160
But before this came out or this episode happen

2423
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,440
That involve Trust

2424
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,720
Vaccine

2425
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:17,280
Close

2426
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,304
Do you talk

2427
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,328
The problem is

2428
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,096
He doesn't even come

2429
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:20,864
Close

2430
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
Conclusion

2431
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:23,168
Is that weird

2432
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,008
The study was a result of 2500

2433
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:29,312
21 online surveys

2434
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:31,104
Looking for determine

2435
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,128
Incredible

2436
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
Providers about vaccine

2437
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,968
Jenny McCarthy

2438
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:40,320
High level of trust for their child

2439
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:41,344
26

2440
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,392
Percent for other doctors

2441
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,416
15%

2442
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,048
Celebrities

2443
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,888
Only 2% reported not trusting The Physician at all

2444
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:59,264
According to the the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics another 2000

2445
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,824
Study of 1420 household

2446
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
Carried out by the national Center

2447
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,384
Number for immunization in

2448
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,224
86.5% of 4

2449
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,808
Respondents reported that they usually followed their clinicians

2450
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:14,368
And 84% reported that they Trust

2451
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:19,232
I'm not sure where we was getting his data from but I can definitely find a to the team

2452
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,000
Contradicting

2453
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,072
I don't know what this the University of

2454
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,864
You can study wise but I I'm just going to

2455
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,632
As default

2456
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,752
Interesting

2457
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,384
Relies on it

2458
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:47,136
Couple of months ago to his employees

2459
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:50,208
Pediatrician

2460
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:53,792
The next morning lights are out the child autistic

2461
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,840
That's gross but also

2462
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:01,472
Mike Adams is part of that 2% believe celebrities

2463
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,776
As a reliable Taxi

2464
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,824
Be part of the 2%

2465
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:10,944
I would rather be

2466
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:13,504
No one

2467
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,808
Why are you dressed

2468
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,600
It's wild

2469
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:23,488
Yeah

2470
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:28,864
Damn anymore

2471
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,912
Fair

2472
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:31,680
Calls now

2473
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:37,312
All that good

2474
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,592
Testing organization

2475
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,384
Victim of a

2476
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,432
Regulation

2477
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,016
I just I wanted

2478
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:48,064
I wanted to look into it a little more so I included

2479
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:52,928
This clip just because I

2480
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:06,496
Yeah they attacked their first amendment rights and then if they were to say anything about this anymore

2481
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,800
They're basically an appointment prison so there

2482
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:13,664
They ended their radio programming and we need the support of the people that's the problem

2483
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,456
Is there attack

2484
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,480
Killing the messenger

2485
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,528
How's it going after the messenger

2486
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,832
Federal Trade Commission

2487
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:23,648
It's who went after I'm not doing nothing

2488
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:30,048
CDC

2489
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,584
Cancer

2490
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,872
They should have

2491
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:46,432
Yeah that's the risk

2492
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:49,504
This is really interesting

2493
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,344
Said that they took away their radio show

2494
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,624
Not true at all

2495
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,672
Outside thing could never type things

2496
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:58,976
Misleadingly and that was how they were funding

2497
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:04,096
The radio show radio show fraud

2498
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:07,936
2009 the courts found against the group known as Daniel chapter 1

2499
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,496
Because

2500
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:11,264
Specifically broken

2501
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
Commission

2502
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:18,176
ABC was the fact their marketing Health product by making two monster be false claims about them

2503
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:20,224
And making a real nice profit doing so

2504
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,760
Reminder products

2505
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,784
Including

2506
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:26,880
The clock there of the Lord there is a truck

2507
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:29,952
True

2508
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:30,976
Christian

BioShock 2

2515
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:52,224
I prefer Bioshock rap

2516
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,272
Preference for nobody

2517
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:57,856
Specifically able to inhibit

2518
02:08:58,112 --> 02:08:58,624

2519
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:03,744
What are the products

2520
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:06,048
The prosecution address D complaint

2521
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,192
Just wright

2522
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
F*** off

2523
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:17,568
Completely when their advertisements were in

2524
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,104
Introduced into court as evidence

2525
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,640
Which four more towards

2526
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,200
Healthcare supplement vibe that I know religion

2527
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,760
The courts determine that nothing about the case

2528
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,808
Infringed on the religious freedom but their actions

2529
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,088
Absolutely violated

2530
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,624
Super protection statutes

2531
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,392
Regarding

2532
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,928
False medical claims about the thing

2533
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
Things are selling

2534
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:39,328
Ultimately Daniel chapter 1 was forced to pay millions of dollars in restitution to customers they defraud it

2535
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,352
And a bunch of fine

2536
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:45,216
You can read the court documents about the case there's a lot of discussion about their first amendment concern

2537
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:47,008
Previous score

2538
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:51,616
Every concern you might have it it's all pretty well laid out in the court documents

2539
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,664
This is a case about a medical

2540
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:57,248
Corsets

2541
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,320
Haley should turn it into it called celeb

2542
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,600
Because they're just

2543
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,136
What is guilty of paddling

2544
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:05,184
Is Daniel chapter 1

2545
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,232
They're just more careful about not making

2546
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:08,000
Medically unfit

2547
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:11,840
Claims about the things

2548
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,704
Bodies of water because

2549
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:19,008
It's getting a little close to home

2550
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,640
Goddamn

2551
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,408
I hate

2552
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,456
This is been such an inch

2553
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
Furiated

02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,248
Triplet YouTube

2555
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:32,576
I know it would be angry at everybody

2556
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:35,136
If it's the only possible way this

2557
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:39,488
Could be worse is if your likes and surprised they did two hours of overdrive

2558
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,768
God dammit

2559
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:44,352
Climate change deniers

2560
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:47,936
Exist I know it was a shock to your system to Gary New York

2561
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,472
Bioshock intercept

2562
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:53,312
Andrew Wakefield show up out of nowhere but I promise you there's no more

2563
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,848
Surprise

2564
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:57,920
Just a couple of weird collars

2565
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:00,992
This first color is describing his experience

2566
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,272
Dealing with

2567
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,368
I think he's presenting it as

2568
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:07,136
Indication

2569
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,416
He's not mentally

2570
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,744
But I would describe the story he's telling

2571
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,304
Pretty indicative that his behavior

2572
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,864
Evidence

2573
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:21,728
My my parents made me go see a therapist

2574
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:24,800
Basically started making things up

2575
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,848
Besan

2576
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:30,432
I was reading his diagnosis actually read

2577
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:32,224
Michael Crichton Terminal Man

2578
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:38,880
Basically just

2579
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:44,000
Completely

2580
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,280
Psychiatrist

2581
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:51,168
Gave me some medication and then

2582
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:54,496
13

2583
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,360
By the time it was all said and done

2584
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:02,688
I was on it first came out

2585
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:05,760
Depakote

2586
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:15,744
Also

2587
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:22,400
Reminder

2588
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:24,960
So you can hear their bike Adams

2589
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:28,032
To talk about guns and mine are all those records

2590
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:31,872
Steven B Adams attempt

2591
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:33,664
Of course

2592
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:35,968
Concern

2593
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:43,136
I'll join the Army no one really cares

2594
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:45,184
Like a pathology

2595
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,000
Takashi

2596
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,792
But I don't know what

2597
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,864
I don't know because he has a game

2598
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,288
The sort of person

2599
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:04,640
He's going to say you lie to a doctor that automatically means something

2600
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:09,760
To which he was doing it

2601
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:12,576
Seem to be indicative of

2602
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,368
As for you you wouldn't.

2603
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:17,696
Hospital

2604
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:18,464
Supposed to do

2605
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,488
You're reporting

2606
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,304
Subjective experience

2607
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,096
Of your own mental state

2608
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,120
It would be

2609
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,936
Negligent

2610
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:30,752
To put you in a hospital perhaps if you

2611
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:32,544
Word describing hearing voices

2612
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,824
That you were disturbed by

2613
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
Like

2614
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
I don't know how he

2615
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,896
He characterized the voices too

2616
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:37,920
Doctors

2617
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:38,688
Musical really

2618
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:39,968
Same

2619
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,760
Response

2620
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,552
What what you just described

2621
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,112
A lot of

2622
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:46,880
Situation

2623
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:48,928
Appropriate

2624
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:50,464
And he was the one who

2625
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:55,584
It seems like from The Limited information we have it does

2626
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,704
Yeah you are the one who's messed up

2627
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,032
Maybe you didn't have

2628
02:14:04,288 --> 02:14:06,848
Depression

2629
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,384
You're describing to the doctor

2630
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:10,688
But your actions belie the

2631
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:12,480
But you had something going off

2632
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:16,064
So

2633
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:23,232
It was like

2634
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:24,256
Well

2635
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
This wasn't

2636
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,376
I think I I think I won

2637
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:37,312
So I'm going to cut off the last clip cuz it's really goodbye

2638
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,200
Expressing

2649
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:24,160
Who are you

2650
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,696
You are what you're saying

2651
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:28,768
Grand

2652
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:38,240
Confirmation for my f****** pioneer

2653
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:42,080
Researcher really are something that we're not

2654
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:42,848
About enough

2655
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,920
You know everybody that everybody talked about how the bees

2656
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:46,688
These are dying and

2657
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,456
The climate is changing

2658
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:48,992
Changing but were missing

2659
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:50,784
Is the real human cost of

2660
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,808
Of so few

2661
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,856
Pioneer pioneer

2662
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:54,880
That is a

2663
02:15:55,136 --> 02:16:01,280
It is a big blow American

2664
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,584
Switzerland

2665
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,120
Yeah

2666
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:08,192
Pioneer of what

2667
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:15,104
Is he also a imagine

2668
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,640
Is on an episode of Gunsmoke

2669
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:20,736
Any played

2670
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,392
The day before got a call from this guy

2671
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:29,696
Who's talking about this gun Bill the HR 2

2672
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,720
226

2673
02:16:32,256 --> 02:16:33,024
Colorization

2674
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:38,656
Makino's about Civic structure and

2675
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:43,264
Recent like an expert that recycles that information as his spirit is

2676
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:46,080
Mike Adams is exact same thing

2677
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:49,152
Pioneer Trucking research scientist

2678
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:49,920
What are you talkin

2679
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:52,480
Just Dutch

2680
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,272
Consist

2681
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:56,576
Thread

2682
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,880
These two episodes

2683
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,928
That were completely f***** up and

2684
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,952
So wide-ranging

2685
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:05,024
Gotten through it in just over two hours

2686
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
Thread is just

2687
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:10,912
Ability

2688
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:12,960
Unwillingness

2689
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:15,008
You call anyone out on the ship

2690
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,032
Yeah

2691
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:16,800
You have this

2692
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,824
Denny payment

2693
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,104
Who is a corrupt

2694
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
F****** a****** Sheriff

2695
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,432
Cousin

2696
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:24,224
Likes the gun stuff you saying

2697
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,784
Refuse any kind of real

2698
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,088
Oh my God you're a megalomaniac

2699
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,624
You're at your a nut

2700
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,416
All you have

2701
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:37,024
Paul Joseph Watson

2702
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,304
Because it's good for business

2703
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,584
Viral video

2704
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,376
Siphoning off some of that audience

2705
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,144
More

2706
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,192
Important to him then actually

2707
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:46,240
Standing up for his

2708
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:48,032
Professed principal

2709
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:51,360
Yeah yeah

2710
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:55,712
Is just allowed to run roughshod

2711
02:17:56,224 --> 02:17:59,296
And because he is also a medical weirdo and he makes

2712
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:02,368
Ton of money off medical wound always bulshit

2713
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,904
Allows that to happen

2714
02:18:04,416 --> 02:18:06,720
And you take this call that he's a f****** Pioneer science

2715
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,000
It's just

2716
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:10,816
Whatever you say you are is what you are

2717
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,096
As long as you're not there

2718
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,168
Children are pure

2719
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:18,240
Because if we're not paying

2720
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,544
Crisis actors

2721
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,152
You're bringing me what I need

2722
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,968
You define yourself board

2723
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:29,504
Sad

2724
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:30,784
Add

2725
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:31,808
Ieg

2726
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:33,600
Together after

2727
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,928
Do you think they ever have meetups where they're all just

2728
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:37,952
Man this

2729
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:41,280
Or do you think they all just hide

2730
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:44,352
To talk about it almost more like a

2731
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:47,424
Like Gunslingers if we're going to continue this metaphor

2732
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,728
Where they're just going into it and they've all got their

2733
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:50,496
Their hand on their web

2734
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,312
I know what you do

2735
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,360
I know what you do I do it too

2736
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:58,176
I think it probably be

2737
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:59,456
Ghost to talk about it

2738
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,504
I don't think that they would

2739
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,832
Arrow be embarrassing

2740
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:11,232
Like Paul Joseph Watson

2741
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:13,792
Yeah

2742
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,864
Sam Smith going through

2743
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:22,240
Sensitivity training

2744
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:26,336
Or whatever okay now here we are all running

2745
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:30,944
I think it's something

2746
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:34,784
You instinctually know what to do

2747
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,856
Yeah

2748
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:45,024
Them knowing about this anything

2749
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:49,376
Bother anybody

2750
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:55,520
I don't know if the people who have left

2751
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:56,544
Said Alex

2752
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:59,104
Said this is a scam

2753
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,408
They just know it is from lived

2754
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:05,248
Experience

2755
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:08,320
Scamp

2756
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:09,344
Evidence

2757
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,160
Especially these days

2758
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,952
Yeah no kids only getting worse

2759
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,976
It's

2760
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,536
Moved from any notion of

2761
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:18,560
Subjective reality in

2762
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
Purely sup

2763
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:20,864
It's terrified

2764
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,144
It is terrific

2765
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,960
So this episode of terrific

2766
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:28,800
Expose

2767
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:31,104
I was really I knew that

2768
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:31,872
Is it James Tracey

2769
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,640
He was coming up

2770
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,408
Eventually

2771
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:36,736
But I knew that that would probably be at least in some ways

2772
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:37,760
A big moment

2773
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:40,832
Investigation

2774
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,624
Yeah and I'm glad

2775
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,416
I'm glad that we are on the other side of it

2776
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:46,208
Because now I think I have a strong

2777
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:47,488
Suspicion that this is where Alex

2778
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:48,512
I'm going to change

2779
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:49,536
Because

2780
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:51,840
Paul Joseph Watson and Alex

2781
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:54,912
When they were on the show Alex on the 17th

2782
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:55,680
The Paul on the 8th

2783
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,216
Both Express

2784
02:20:57,472 --> 02:21:00,288
Did they know that this video was as popular as it was

2785
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:03,360
Review video

2786
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
Sandy Hook crisis actors

2787
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,920
False flag

2788
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:08,480
I think that's going to have aliens

2789
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,016
Inform things moving forward

2790
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,552
Which is very interesting

2791
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,320
Because

2792
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,880
Had we not spent the time and gone through all of it

2793
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,648
We wouldn't

2794
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,416
Know that

2795
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:18,208
Didn't care that much

2796
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:20,000
Wake up till this

2797
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:20,768
Point

2798
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:22,560
He didn't even care that much

2799
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:27,680
It makes a lot of sense

2800
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,472
Assume

2801
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:32,032
One of his motivations might be

2802
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:34,336
Recognizing the market

2803
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:38,432
Moving forward

2804
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,456
Pivot towards

2805
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:40,480
Covering sand

2806
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,504
Hook and talkin about

2807
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,272
Sandy Hook

2808
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,808
You know damn well that's why

2809
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,880
That's probably unfair to say

2810
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,648
With certainty

2811
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,440
Like that

2812
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:50,464
Probably

2813
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:51,744
Right

2814
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,280
Unlike

2815
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:54,304
People

2816
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,072
SafeLink

2817
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:56,864
However

2818
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,656
It sure does look like all the oven

2819
02:21:58,912 --> 02:21:59,936
Pointing towards

2820
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,896
Question even become

2821
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,992
What's fun about going through this

2822
02:22:13,248 --> 02:22:14,272
We could have much more robot

2823
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,832
Alex

2824
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:17,600
Just saying

2825
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:19,136
He said that they were after that

2826
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,928
Conclusion

2827
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,744
Is so weird

2828
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:27,328
It's always weird we learned along the way

2829
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,376
How we learned about lovemaking

2830
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:32,704
In the early 1900s

2831
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,496
Welearn

2832
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:38,592
We learned about

2833
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:39,616
To talk about

2834
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,640
Comments I'm glad

2835
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,200
Organically came up within the investigation

2836
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,224
Rhino

2837
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:44,992
Sorry

2838
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:48,064
Is the worst

2839
