1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge b b

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Exit

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordan question for you sir

8
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
That would have been fantastic

9
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
Tweets about 10 or so so I figured I would

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,832
I will try and get it out in front of it

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,696
It was good tennis morning in reality my bright spot is over this weekend

12
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
Made a rare public appearance

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
Able

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
To I was invited to Jared Holt

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Sweating friend why do Jared Holt

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Next time

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Play I've not been

18
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
2 wedding anniversary long time

19
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
I also

20
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Lockout

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
South it was a nice time

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
False

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Always nice to

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
60 people in love

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
What are you laughing

26
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
I'm sorry I'm sorry

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
I'm sorry there's nothing funny about that it is always nice

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,848
My bright spot is yesterday

29
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
At the airport and I was later on

30
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
She landed

31
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Or the landing is good I like that everything was fun

32
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
All the magical spells I kept to keep her here they are there only proximity-based

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,400
No she's going to care after this but they also maybe these spells I helped

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Airplane lamps

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
You know

36
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
It was it is interesting

37
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
Because it was basically like that say was the

38
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Closest I'll get to sending

39
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
A child this summer

40
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,320
Okay do you have all your stuff is everything packed and ready are you going to be okay don't miss me too much

41
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,952
You know that whole thing do you have an emergency number solutely absolutely I'm ready

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
She's happy having a great time and I'm alone

43
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
It's good news

44
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
For everybody

45
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Hey alright

46
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
Today we got episode

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
To do

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
Situation in Sri Lanka

49
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Naturally

50
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
We've got the obvious estimation

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
I got to be honest

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
Sri Lanka are not countries that are that important to Alex

53
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
In the past

54
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
It is not been

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Major

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
Movers and shakers Within globalist

57
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
2 conspiracies

58
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
And I don't particularly care what his take on

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
Any of it is at least I'm not like

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
In a Mad Dash

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Do Define

62
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Yeah I'm fine without that

63
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
Yeah I mean what are you going to say it's all an attack on the globe

64
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Probably I mean

65
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
I think the only interesting thing I would be

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
What's his take on the homemade

67
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
A gun

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
Oh that the adjuster with homemade guns are those against the rules because they

69
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Take money away from honest hard-working

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Gun manufacturer

71
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,071
Think that his take would have to

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
I think I've heard him talk about like 3D printing and stuff

73
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
He has to be in favor

74
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Because otherwise you would be like

75
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,103
Making a commercial necessity for the existence of your right to

76
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
Defend yourself seem to be the case

77
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Craft a spear out of a stick

78
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
For self-defense yes you can buy

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
A sword or spear you can make a shiv sure

80
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,559
I spell this is the second event that is an interesting conversation that I think the Supreme Court will

81
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Eventually

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
Undoubtedly is coming soon

83
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
It turns out

84
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
I may I made a little bit of a

85
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
So

86
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
Boxcar Willie Nelson Mandela effect

87
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Me a message

88
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
I don't know I don't have a ride

89
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Person

90
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
How's it going every name on there so

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
But

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
They reached out and asked

93
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
That

94
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
We do an episode

95
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
For their son's 18th birthday

96
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Naturally it was

97
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
June 23rd

98
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
That was

99
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Yesterday

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
I mean

101
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
You're recording this

102
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
On June 22nd

103
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,591
Nope we're going to do this we're going to pull it off then we recorded I don't know when it'll be released

104
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,479
We're not we got to own up to it

105
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Reach Out

106
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Plenty of time in a tree

107
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Maybe too much time in advance

108
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,487
And I said I'll make a note make a note about this

109
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:57,887
It's your son's 18th birthday and the council cannot say no to people who ask

110
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
I'd so I did make

111
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Make a note and

112
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
I lost it

113
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
I also told them

114
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Time to send a message

115
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Tips to remind me which they did

116
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Control

117
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Did not see the message

118
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
But hey we're only a couple weeks

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
Let's just remind everybody it is just the two of us in it that means you

120
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
That means it's just

121
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
Yeah

122
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
And sometimes

123
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Email

124
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Sandboxes

125
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,143
Are completely destroyed

126
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
Them

127
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
We're late

128
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,591
But I want to wish you a happy birthday to Boxcar Willie Nelson Mandela effects child

129
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Of course

130
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,455
Say a very excited that you're going to register to vote

131
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
Very very fun

132
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
I wish you the best

133
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
Don't buy a gun

134
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
I'd so

135
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
We had a request

136
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
To do this episode about the day that this child was born

137
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
I am so this would be June 23rd 2004

138
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
And

139
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
That is what we're doing today

140
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Happy 18th keep them someday

141
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,199
You turned a team just in time for Jules to be outlawed

142
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Welcome

143
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,623
So this episode is actually pretty

144
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
42in

145
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
It's interesting that this was randomly

146
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
Chosen episode based on this

147
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
Because

148
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Stuff very much worth

149
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Sure I'm so I'm excited about that but

150
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
I would like to

151
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Give a happy birthday message

152
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
And the only way we know how

153
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
Jimmy someone life is giving someone death

154
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
You can say that

155
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Life is death

156
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Happy birthday

157
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Let's

158
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Begin here on June 23rd

159
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Here is why

160
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
This is

161
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
A fortuitous

162
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Episode trust a cover

163
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,919
Maybe coming on the show

164
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,783
He of course is the father involved in the Ruby Ridge standoff

165
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
Yeah whose wife and child

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
Jaguar killed by by the government

167
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Also

168
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
It's just a

169
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
B of A

170
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Nutty guy

171
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
It's too late

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
It's kind of difficult sometimes

173
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
To disambiguate

174
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
The tragedy that happened

175
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
And the mistakes

176
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Egregious mistakes

177
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
In some respect

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
Text that were made by the government in terms of carrying out

179
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Thing

180
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Also just

181
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:58,879
Not a one of those standoffs

182
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
It's usually not cuz you're in the best place

183
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,535
And then when the government murdered your family that usually doesn't like improve things

184
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,655
So there's a lot of can argue that a lot of really shity stuff about him

185
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
You know obviously there's the

186
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,031
He was hanging out with the Aryan Nation

187
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Compound butter

188
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Illegal weapon

189
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
That he

190
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Was probably

191
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Deeply anti-Semitic

192
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
There's a picture of him

193
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
I bet you

194
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Can find where he's wearing the shirt

195
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Potatoes

196
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
Just say no to the Zog Zionist occupied government obviously

197
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Geology of that just

198
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Defies

199
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Killing his wife in

200
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,703
Yes family thing is the real problem here

201
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Like I get he's a racist piece

202
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
The s*** but don't murder his family

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
Do you eat from my understanding of in my looking

204
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
Sing into the

205
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
The events of that standoff

206
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,135
It's not like the government came in and there were like haha we're going to kill your family

207
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
A lot of

208
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
Worst case scenario situation

209
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
That ended up

210
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Spiraling

211
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Handwriting

212
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
2

213
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
What happened

214
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
People who did

215
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I'll kill people should be off the hook

216
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
It's not as cut-and-dry as the

217
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Murdered

218
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
These people

219
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,295
To portray it premeditated murder

220
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,671
We've talked a bit about the the Ruby Ridge situation and past episodes

221
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
And so I don't want to do

222
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Too much on it

223
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
Halo

224
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Talk about this

225
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
For half an hour

226
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
But

227
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
It's

228
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Wild

229
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
To see Randy Weaver

230
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Appearing on it

231
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,031
Infowars that's not something that I was aware

232
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
I didn't know that he was

233
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Like somebody

234
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,943
Who would go on Infowars and Alex were acquainted

235
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
I guess I could have assumed that in

236
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
On some level

237
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,111
I don't know if I've ever heard like I knew that Alex had worked

238
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Early on in his career

239
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
To try and help rebuild the Mount Carmel Church

240
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
The Branch Davidians

241
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
But I don't know if I've ever heard Branch Davidians on his show

242
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
Right I knew that he supported Randy Weaver and

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
The ruby-red Scituate

244
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,591
Is obviously a catalyzing and radicalizing moment for a lot of the right-wing

245
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
I didn't I did

246
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
Didn't know that he ever appeared on

247
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,551
Surprise I was it did he did Randy Weaver make a ton of

248
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Media appearances

249
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Following like

250
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
I mean like

251
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Afterwards for sure

252
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
But like over the years did he

253
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
He continued to have that

254
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
I think he probably did make a

255
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
A number of them but I

256
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
It assumed that they be like

257
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
An ABC documentary about

258
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,847
Not 26

259
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Surprised

260
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
I'm surprised

261
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
To hear my divorce because I think that his standards would be higher

262
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Ono Island

263
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Just not a great place to go

264
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
But I think that the reality is that

265
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,135
This interview is most

266
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Happening

267
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Cuz

268
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Randy Weaver's got

269
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
To work

270
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
He does mention

271
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
The next stop on his book 2

272
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
To work

273
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
A Mexican restaurant on

274
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Some Highway outside of Austin

275
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Play Castaways it's in Texas

276
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Can't figure out which one it is cuz there's multiple of the time I restaurant on that Highway

277
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
I do spend a bit of time trying to figure out take a left at the but it's the one with the corner

278
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,511
Got the mountain on it not that McDonald's it's basically that

279
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
An appearance at this makes

280
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Chicken restaurant

281
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Going to give a speech

282
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
But he'll answer some

283
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
And then everybody's going to have a nice day

284
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Okay

285
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
And then also I guess calling

286
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Morganton Ford

287
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
I'm surprised to her was not so successful that I found out about

288
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,943
Because this Mexican restaurant situation

289
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Something's very promising towards it's her the career

290
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
I think

291
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Book Nevada Mexican restaurant

292
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
I get some

293
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
I can get to the burrito and here about 2

294
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,351
I ran it open my got of a Mexican restaurant for a long time so yeah I've been there buddy

295
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Didn't go out

296
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Didn't go well

297
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,775
I went to this because I didn't either I've completely ruined the surprise that he

298
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
He does end up showing up

299
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Because Alex is trying to get him on

300
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
He does in fact

301
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Appear

302
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Wildside

303
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
I'm over selling

304
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
It's

305
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,159
There's a couple things that are like what

306
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,207
Wild might be

307
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
So Alex is mad at abl

308
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
Good you'll never guess why

309
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
What's my name

310
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Yeesh

311
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Camera reviews

312
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
People I mean

313
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
That is

314
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,815
Is an interesting way to be like we don't want to be anti-Semitic

315
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Ozark cast

316
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Obviously I mean no the part where I

317
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
The part where I was making wait no

318
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Anyways these people

319
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Oh boy yeah that's that's a mess

320
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
And then the other thing too is that like

321
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
The obvious can play

322
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
What's going on is

323
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Shameful

324
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
What is mythica

325
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Complaint is

326
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
The Texas GOP part of their platform is this

327
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
America is a Christian Nation

328
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
That is

329
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Troubling

330
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
For groups

331
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Spit or non-Christian

332
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
This country is about us not you we own this nation and we allow you

333
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
U2 live here

334
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Exactly yes

335
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
Conflating that with the ideas

336
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Things that you're Christian

337
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
What is antisemitic

338
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Which is not at all what anybody is

339
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Is it starting

340
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,735
He's using this sarcasm in order to create a straw man

341
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
To argue against because I actually position

342
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Any actual complaint

343
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
It's being made

344
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Ate something that he acts

345
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
He can't argue with

346
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
No no I mean

347
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
The fun part is that just because you say something in a sarcastic

348
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Tone does not mean that you are also admitting that it is true

349
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
You know like

350
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Oh

351
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
I liked

352
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
To see the sun outside

353
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,287
Like no you do why I don't understand why you're being sarcastic about that you don't like

354
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Jews thank you

355
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,127
One of the things that I think you're going to see and I noticed

356
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
Descendants episode in particular is it was one of his like

357
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Major rhetorical Tech

358
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
Is this sarcasm

359
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Being used

360
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
To create a straw man version of an argument

361
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
That he

362
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
It's the only way out for

363
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
There's no other real taxi

364
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
We can use

365
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
Covers of story this is one of the big stories

366
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Of the day and I honestly think like

367
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
It's alright this is an annoying

368
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
But I do

369
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Really know if it is

370
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Like Alex thinks this is

371
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Police state

372
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
River

373
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
Riverton Wyoming

374
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Carnival

375
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Peter

376
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Determination

377
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
So

378
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,495
Look I mean obviously if you're camping in Yellowstone

379
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Or a lot of national parks

380
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Leaving food out

381
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Is dangerous to other

382
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
People attract bears

383
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Yeah and other animals

384
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
That could

385
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Cause harm

386
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
People in that swai

387
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Seriously Alex can minimize the

388
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
She left out marshmallows but

389
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Like you could get someone to

390
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
It's something that

391
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
There's a reason that ruhligs

392
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Just that but it's just like the very basic level of

393
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Engaged with

394
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
The world that you live in it you can go to

395
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
To the Yellowstone National Park

396
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Carelessly throw away food as though it's nothing

397
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Then

398
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
The f*** you

399
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
You know

400
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
You go to jail

401
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
F*** you

402
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Yeah and that's the reason there's a fine

403
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
Real situation is obviously some there was some

404
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Sort of

405
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Miscommunication

406
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
And somewhere

407
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Something happened

408
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
Where to pay the fine

409
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
But it didn't go into the system or something

410
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
Clerical error of some sort

411
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
She went on a cruise

412
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Saw the warrant when she came back

413
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,495
And now the judge is apologizing to her

414
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,543
Insisting that they figure out what went wrong

415
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
The prosecutor is saying hey

416
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
What's letter goes

417
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
Can clear up this warrant

418
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
Like obviously yeah

419
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
Maybe she should have

420
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Some sort of rest

421
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Institution from the state like

422
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Here's a

423
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Couple thousand dollars

424
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
For your trouble

425
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Or something

426
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
You f***** up

427
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
But this isn't

428
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Police station

429
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,559
This is an unfortunate circumstance

430
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
I obviously feel for her I right

431
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
It's annoying to be caught up in something like this

432
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Pictures of Deadpool

433
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,799
Why is this a big story for him right all right

434
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
I get that at

435
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
The same time

436
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,967
Who the f*** is putting out warrants for a $50 fine

437
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
I bet it's a warrant they would never be served of course now that would only come up if you get arrested for something else

438
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Or re-entering the country

439
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
So what we really have

440
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
How to deal with Heroin

441
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
Once again is our border patrol is out of

442
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
Whatever their out-of-control Customs and Border Patrol

443
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Even if 2004

444
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
Control debate

445
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
Is

446
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
I have close to a non-issue as an issue can be

447
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
ITune

448
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Think of the situation that she had

449
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Like I said

450
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Big headache

451
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,071
Probably put the bad into your vacation sure sure

452
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
But

453
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Everything

454
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
Seems to have gone exactly right

455
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
Bright past

456
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
The point of that into

457
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
When Alex says

458
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
It goes on and on

459
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Whenever he stops reading a story

460
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Well no

461
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,440
That something has come up in the reading of that story that contradicts what he'd already said I got you

462
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
He explains

463
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
While he's reading

464
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
That custom

465
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
Sometimes runs

466
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,912
Warrant checks on people re-entering the country evening Cruise Line

467
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
And

468
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
Earlier he had said

469
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
They run background checks and face scan you when you go on cruises

470
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,408
And he contradicted that and that's why you think I'm going to bail on this

471
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,736
Before I contradict more vitamins

472
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Right I got you

473
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
That makes sense

474
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,672
I'm not I'm not horrified by it in terms of a police state

475
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah I mean it just seemed like the judge should have looked at himself and then looked at them there and been like

476
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
We are here which means somewhere in the system

477
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
Any system that whines up here we just need to fix from

478
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
The start

479
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Apologize exactly exactly have dismantled the entire legal system along

480
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
But that might just be me

481
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Yeah I think that's

482
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,552
For this correct it could be

483
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
So we have a movie coming out in

484
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
14

485
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
What's

486
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
It's a movie that has excited about

487
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Okay

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
Expect that I Am Legend

489
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
Truth about 9/11

490
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
I like to be saying that Michael Moore gives bad Solutions and all of his illusions

491
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
Self-promotion

492
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Are you promoting Alex's s***

493
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Yeah yeah

494
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
The screening

495
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Fahrenheit 9/11

496
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
I'd get them to

497
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
How do you mean

498
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
Get them into my Revenue stream

499
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,072
Recruit this is a perfect recruitment ground bracket right

500
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
So what's going to happen

501
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay

502
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
So

503
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,984
Michael Moore is like we need to let the Democrats take over America that's a terrible idea

504
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
He gets bad solution

505
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Sprite we all know that

506
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
But what

507
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
You should do

508
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
Go to an actual business

509
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
And ask for them to

510
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,504
To print out business cards for a place you are unaffiliated with

511
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
In order to give a message to someone who has never wanted to hear it

512
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,440
And then give them a business card that they're going to throw away

513
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
Probably so he is asking you

514
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Do politely

515
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,376
Throw dollar bills at a stranger and the stranger could have

516
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
Did you least use the dollar bill with the

517
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Oops of

518
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Getting them into Alex's information space

519
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,712
Better than if you print up a goddamn business card I bet a lot of people to do that

520
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
Bill marketing

521
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Mia

522
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
What's going on is this

523
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
This is like

524
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Trying to escalate

525
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
I promise

526
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,376
Yeah but you know you have the premise that introduced by Fahrenheit 911

527
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:14,240
People to go around to the yellow not only that but

528
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
After all these people refusing repeater

529
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Annoying

530
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
And also

531
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
Counter to Alex's

532
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,296
Very consistent positions about Michael more about how much he hates

533
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,600
He's useful right now right

534
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Because 9/11

535
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
My brand

536
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
And

537
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
He's allowed in

538
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
In theaters

539
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,792
It is a little bit like if Alex

540
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,144
Went to a Alex was like Hey listen go to this Marvel movie

541
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
And whenever they play the end credits

542
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
15

543
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,824
Boston with your DVD of our post-credits

544
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,432
Avengers endgame

545
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
Collin Avenger

546
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,368
It would kind of be like if Brian stelter

547
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Made a movie about

548
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Covid

549
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
And then Alex wanted people

550
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,072
Promote a movie

551
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,192
But listen we've had a lot of disagreements in the past but this is going to partially wake up a lot of people find

552
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
I can somehow profit off this

553
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,104
Go to see everything I believe is malleable and negotiable

554
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,224
Playing the trailer for Fahrenheit 911

555
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
What are the trailer

556
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Bringatrailer

557
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
It's just Alex recognizes the radicalization potential there's going to be a certain amount

558
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,672
How people who go see this movie that are emotionally affected and invulnerable State when they leave the theater in that

559
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:13,792
Is an inflection point that is a point where they're malleable enough that you can get them to think like

560
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
What is the planes were remote

561
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Control

562
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
That's why I

563
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
Recruit at bus station

564
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
When you get off the bus you're ready to join a cult

565
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
That's just the case for everybody

566
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
You're not supposed to look

567
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,968
You got no choice

568
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,808
You just want to get away from whatever's in the bus now essentially

569
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,160
So leaving all that behind us Alex's workgroup

570
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Matt Drive

571
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,512
We get to something that I think is is one of the

572
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
Great things

573
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
News about listening to Alec

574
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
What's in the past

575
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
We get these little slices of life

576
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
He's a little

577
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
Pictures and glimpses into what his life

578
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Was like

579
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
Early on

580
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Any makes a claim

581
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
About his high school years

582
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Think this is possibly true

583
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
I want to make a cup

584
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
School

585
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
About 12 years ago

586
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
District was doing

587
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Echo testing in ER

588
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
Classroom setting into the guys

589
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
Every senior at his high school.

590
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Clockwork Orange

591
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Call man

592
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
That is nuts

593
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
We get Bronson on the phone he interviewed everybody

594
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,648
I feel like that might have come up

595
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,024
All right I think unless he went to a

596
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,048
Completely wacky

597
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
High School

598
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
What you did

599
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,472
This absolutely did not happen hours upon hours of

600
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,752
Electrodes

601
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
MTV scream stranger things went to that high school he was there with 11 he wasn't he wasn't going to these

602
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,504
You were always close they had every single

603
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Every single

604
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,600
Senior at their eyes tried open and they do watch

605
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,392
Flashing screen

606
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
That's why I can't

607
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Was the debate over

608
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,024
So another explained

609
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
A lot of

610
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
Glimpses into Alex's life

611
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:30,752
About Alex's dad okay

612
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
None of this matches Alex's other bio things

613
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
As for the told him all this future sup

614
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,160
And let's not forget that his dad had to move from Rockwall

615
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
Because Alex

616
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Got in trouble with the

617
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,024
Police but he insisted were selling drugs

618
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,376
Nine racketeering operation and they threatened to kill Alex they didn't

619
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Leave town

620
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
He's not not you fit 18

621
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
This is bulshit

622
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
Yeah I kind of believe

623
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:42,176
I believe this story insofar as it would make sense as to why he's committed himself to a life of

624
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
Gryffin cry

625
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
Can do become a school teacher you going to be broke

626
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
What you should do

627
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,672
Grift millions of dollars from people duh

628
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,232
Be a criminal if you want to succeed in the lawn first

629
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
But also if you just wanted

630
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Three criminals be a criminal and that's

631
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,168
The way to do it legally because they haven't outlawed it yet

632
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
This story is b*******

633
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Considered in the context of

634
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
Alex is all of his other stories

635
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,064
So how naive is he at this point are you a criminal Alex

636
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Legally has to say yeah

637
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
You better believe murdered multiple crimes in this time.

638
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,312
She was 16 you know like a crime

639
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Prime

640
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,640
I love this

641
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Assistant thing with Alex that is

642
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Everybody who

643
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,808
He runs into his friends of his dad or whatever

644
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:57,184
There is a highest level the top Ranger Federal Marshal Intex

645
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,584
Nobody's ever just like a middle manager at a bank

646
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,448
Oil producers in the country Mercedes

647
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Oh yeah

648
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
So

649
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
The top person

650
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,824
Coup

651
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,920
Actually how you would rank people involved in Ruby Ridge

652
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,968
Randy Weaver's probably the most

653
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
Stooges member of that event

654
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
And he's on

655
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Now

656
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,304
Thanks Alex glad to be here and I watch new one

657
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,984
What's new Under the Sun

658
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Well what's most

659
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,040
Probably what was important to him 10 years ago and that's

660
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
One World Government

661
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,720
So it's important to remember that talks about one world government

662
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Cycling to some

663
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
American Spirits 8 theories

664
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,656
Yeah reason to know that

665
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
With the

666
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
The world of

667
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Ruby red

668
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,776
The entire story

669
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
What Randy believe

670
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Actually

671
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:24,736
On some levels Alex doesn't know a lot about

672
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
Alex is very much

673
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
Created a Randy Weaver in

674
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
His mind

675
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,416
That Brandy Weaver believes without

676
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
Believes

677
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
Those two shall never meet

678
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:41,888
All right and I imagine that Alex heard Bill Cooper talking about Randy Weaver Ruby Ridge

679
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Assertive

680
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
Flip some switches in his head

681
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,032
Ruby Ridge at this time is already lore

682
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
It's already not even a real events

683
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
So much as it is

684
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:55,968
Is the story of the event happened because of

685
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
The

686
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,272
Waco

687
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,832
The Oklahoma City bombing being fired

688
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,160
In some ways because of those events right

689
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,464
And if it does become a larger Ark

690
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,768
That

691
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
Specific

692
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
A33 pill

693
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
You know you don't remember Horace Grant

694
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Contributions in 1991

695
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,312
You just remember Robert Horry

696
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,384
So here's another thought

697
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,664
That Randy has

698
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,416
And it's going to be too late

699
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,976
They're going to be sorry

700
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,768
And they really should get

701
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,304
Defensive offence

702
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
Join our side

703
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,096
End

704
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
Police officer

705
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,288
We better get up get out and join our side

706
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Wow

707
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,176
Wow I'm not going to join your side

708
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
No I mean I mean

709
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Is is Randy Weaver about to read

710
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,296
From the Turner Diaries on

711
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:08,672
Conair is that was about to happen he doesn't get that far. The Bookies on tour for

712
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,536
Talking about how everybody at his school got Clockwork Orange

713
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
It's part and parcel of this

714
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,216
Weird narrative he has about the government forcing everybody

715
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Need to get on antipsychotics

716
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Which

717
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
Talked about here a little bit

718
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
As we know this happen

719
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
Yeah the government years later

720
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
Forcibly drugged with antipsychotic

721
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
People who get diagnosed with conditions

722
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
Could be helped by psychotic

723
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
Forced to be on

724
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,128
Nope nope

725
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,736
Yeah they have as of yet not eliminated either droogs or milk

726
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,576
Both of those still in full Supply

727
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,440
Full disclosure I'm on

728
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
Where is very long time

729
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,328
What kind of medicine not because I think they didn't

730
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
And work because

731
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,424
I was just going to going along with talk

732
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,496
Therapy ingestion

733
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Wasn't taking meds

734
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
That would have

735
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
No one

736
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,736
Pressured me in anyway that's the weirdest part all too often I remember is like it's easily not be on meds

737
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:42,880
You should have at least

738
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,696
Any Triumph I would have I would have been fine with that hate Maybe

739
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Triumph

740
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,072
Nobody ever gave me that it's so weird the reality of Mental Health

741
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
As compared

742
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
To the version of it that

743
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Existen Alex

744
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,240
There's like they're going to test everybody

745
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
As if it were.

746
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Possible to

747
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
To test everybody

748
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,152
Diagnosis is not like

749
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
You can't just take

750
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,016
Blood be like

751
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:15,648
It doesn't work that way no it's

752
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,232
Are nothing but the other thing that I've been doing on Fridays I've been talk

753
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:25,376
Talking to people outside of our showing their experiences with men

754
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:30,752
Old watches magicians Isabel

755
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,848
I know it's really really interesting because everybody story around this

756
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Regardless of whether or not they

757
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
How to diagnosis or whether they're just

758
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
Like suspicious or they've done talk therapy or tried everything

759
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
All unique

760
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,832
And none of it has ever been like

761
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
People work

762
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Clearly helping

763
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,232
Get the help I need

764
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
Incredibly uncommon

765
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
A lot of vehicle

766
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Also

767
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
That there's an under understood

768
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Aspect of this

769
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
Particularly for people like Alex

770
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
That is it

771
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
If process

772
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
Like if you're not engaging with it and

773
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,736
Working absolute it often

774
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
Will not

775
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Leeds

776
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Any kind of

777
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Progress

778
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
It's silly

779
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,720
Sing is silly

780
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:26,560
Anybody would listen to him yell about how the government

781
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
It's going to

782
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Forcibly

783
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:34,752
Screen everybody somehow for mental illness haven't forcibly drug everyone psychotic

784
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Is

785
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
Is Ludacris I mean anybody

786
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,920
The f*** is this guy's problem I don't know about something else

787
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
You know it's not

788
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
It's not real

789
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
Yeah then the fact that this is from 2000

790
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:51,392
Forgives me zero hope 2040

791
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,232
Not not feeling good about the future

792
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,328
Kinds of attacks on Psych

793
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
A Masjid

794
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
G

795
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
In the present and Alex

796
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
Of course is still banging this drama although he's

797
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,080
Clearly has no real G now I don't know Reelfoot

798
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
Imagine if

799
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
At this time. In 2004 he's

800
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
He's banging the drum for people getting help

801
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,856
More people getting the f****** help that they need well I'm going to just say this and I can't prove this obviously fit

802
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Working theory of mine

803
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,928
That is the reason the people like Alex

804
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,256
And Marjorie are so opposed to mental health care

805
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Is because a large part of their base

806
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Probably me

807
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,424
They need some kind of

808
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Probably be

809
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Be in these communities

810
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
If they were receiving appropriate Mental Health

811
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
Yeah and I would lose their audience

812
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,896
And the market that they make money off of

813
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
Were people

814
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
To take their health

815
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
Right eye I mean

816
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
You know somehow that sounds cynical

817
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,136
You know the idea that these these people are willing to

818
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
Perpetuate and exploit

819
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,024
Pains of people who give them their trust

820
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Implicitly

821
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Play N total

822
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
You know that's Annika

823
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
I'm going to go even worse Ivan

824
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Think that they

825
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Mass shootings are good

826
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
A business

827
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,568
So how cynical do we got a cynical are we going to treat this

828
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,872
I think I know

829
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:19,968
Join you slightly as long as we provide the caveat that I own

830
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Think any of that is

831
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Just process

832
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:27,136
I don't think it necessarily is a thought that like shootings are good for our

833
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
Politics and I don't think I don't think

834
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
Think that Alex or Marjorie are like

835
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
Attack psych meds because

836
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,144
The people in our audience and leave them and we would lose money if people got healthy

837
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
I think that is a conscious

838
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
This thing but I think on some level

839
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,312
Part of the motivation

840
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
Intuitive understanding

841
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
Yeah I don't think they're in like a

842
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,200
Lounge with a fireplace

843
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
Snifters

844
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
Brandy going how can we destroy the Vino but

845
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,368
It's their amazing kid in some ways it is there

846
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,024
So Alex gets back to the story about the woman who left marshmallows out

847
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Yellowstone

848
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,608
Wendy Weavers take on this

849
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
Don't tell me cursive

850
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
It's not good

851
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,176
No criminal record

852
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
You know I didn't

853
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
See that article

854
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
It is so

855
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,391
Anymore

856
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,207
The first thing I tell people to do Alex

857
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Get R Gun

858
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
Get loaded

859
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
People with

860
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
And if somebody wants

861
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,607
To come and give you a $50 ticket

862
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
From marshmallow

863
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
What litter or whatever

864
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
I'm afraid.

865
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Is marshmello

866
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Finish ticket in.

867
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Get out of my face

868
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
Real quick seems like a great idea with a gun

869
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
For trying to get a ticket for leasing food out

870
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Which could attract

871
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
There's another

872
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:33,855
Edibles and beer

873
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Bowser

874
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
People enjoying Yellowstone

875
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,815
If that's your solution for a $50 ticket solution I don't know if I want to hear your solutions for

876
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,655
Any other problems

877
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,751
Variations on one idea

878
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,775
Brandy's head

879
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Is a

880
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,943
Hey here's the ticket you left food out at walk walk away

881
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,343
Away

882
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,743
You're under arrest for a massive felony of threatening a Ray Wright with Wright

883
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,279
Find out all forest rangers can

884
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
Control animals and there we go

885
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
Everyone is now

886
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:26,079
BAU

887
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
For something that you did that is against the rules

888
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
And now we're turning it into a life-or-death situation with the

889
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:38,623
Loaded weapons involved

890
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Mayonnaise and then she got mayonnaise can I get to take on this real quick

891
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Just always

892
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
Just always have a loaded gun

893
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:58,079
Yellowstone agreeing to the conditions of that like

894
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,615
You are in the wrong

895
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,639
If you eat food out

896
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:05,759
Are you I mean this is one of those big moments where I would like everybody to understand

897
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
You are less important than Yellowstone Park

898
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
As an individual

899
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,695
I am more concerned with Yellowstone Park in the long-term

900
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Boutros Boutros

901
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
You exist

902
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,559
In the conversation of the park

903
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,655
In the context of the other people that are there

904
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,495
You have a responsibility both to the nature and to

905
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
Everyone else was

906
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,823
Just as much of a right to enjoy it as me

907
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
And

908
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,431
Yeah I do I don't understand this being presented is tyranny

909
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
As much as it is just

910
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
A formulation of making

911
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
I'm sure everyone is

912
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Respectful to each other

913
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
Obviously it would be great if

914
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:46,719
You didn't have to worry about people leaving to wear out but I do need to punish

915
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Real people

916
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,119
Forget melda's leave food out everybody's going to get eaten by bears mean it is it is like

917
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Can you imagine

918
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
Narnia had tourist adjust B

919
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,287
Garbage everywhere people throwing garbage at mr. tumnus

920
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:05,663
Space like that's the way I've always thought of national parks is like literally I'm going into a magical place

921
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,503
Well if it louder is they might get something better than Turkish delight

922
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
Maybe there's an upside

923
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,879
So this the spirals out of control and

924
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,975
Reveal something that Alex really doesn't want to

925
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
I wouldn't.

926
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
The ticket

927
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
Yeah you tell me about it

928
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
Scary

929
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
You know what's scary is these people

930
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
I thought I think

931
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Dragon growth

932
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
People think the way they do

933
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
For sure was a

934
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
Freshman High School

935
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,151
Alex is really wanting this to look like

936
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:15,551
A joke or a metaphor but it is not helping with that conversation turned to the

937
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
Wrong direction sell faster

938
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,207
At this point still trying to Brand himself as

939
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,047
Different not that David Icke and UFO type

940
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Aaliyah it cuz he

941
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
He wants that like

942
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Credibility of like

943
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,447
He's like how Tucker for a long time

944
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
Or even just this week

945
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,919
To distinguish yourself from something that is a touchstone

946
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
Is silly to crazy

947
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
At this point it's the alien stuff

948
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Documents

949
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
In the Bilderberg Group

950
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,463
And yet he doesn't want Randy Weaver this large figure the page

951
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
Patriot right-wing movement

952
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,791
To be honest show talking about how he

953
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
You seen UFOs about something with a kid

954
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,679
And he believes in Aliens and maybe that the people in charge are actually alien

955
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
Yeah

956
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
I have to pretend that it's a metaphor a joke

957
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
It's not

958
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
You can't

959
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,383
You know if you're blindsided by it you can't turn it around

960
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Until it's too late

961
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,295
You know the moment he said people don't think like that differently there aliens from when I was growing up here like

962
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Okay that's fine

963
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:26,207
That sounds great you know people are different and then he's like they're aliens you're like hahaha

964
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:30,047
Nothing I can do now LOL I disagree I disagree

965
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,911
The weather out like when I grow up I think they're aliens

966
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
You need to immediately say hi you said it might be like a brandy

967
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:47,967
Conversation

968
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,831
How's the kids Bento s*** no not like that

969
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Conversation

970
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Talkabouttd

971
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Do pivot the conversation right hard

972
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
Because

973
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,559
It's so silly

974
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
For you to allow it to go into like

975
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
How's the UFOs my whole life

976
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,751
Really wants

977
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
This to look like a

978
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,759
No I'm not

979
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,831
I am crazy you know we are the naughty ones

980
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Alex

981
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Accept the fact

982
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Big Lots

983
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Okay

984
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
It's not joking doesn't have the chops

985
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
For that yet

986
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,311
He has been like Randy is being like

987
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,639
Facetious and sarcastic with the yeah we're The Crazy Ones

988
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,455
He wasn't about the aliens

989
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,503
Play all of it as joking in

990
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
No but

991
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,599
Get out he gets off the subject

992
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
As little damage

993
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Just possible

994
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,695
I guess

995
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
I just

996
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Ivy

997
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
It's hard to go from

998
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
What's your take on this

999
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Cruise thing

1000
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,959
Shoot people

1001
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,775
What's things like now

1002
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
Aliens are everywhere okay alright this is Uber is going to be at a Mexican restaurant we can figure

1003
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,759
Where it is interview for everyone involved

1004
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,319
Another really bad ass by

1005
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Oh no

1006
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
I enjoyed

1007
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,207
I don't get you

1008
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Shortwave radios

1009
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
Several years ago and I never I still can't get the

1010
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
Starting to work there in Jefferson Iowa

1011
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
I cannot pick up

1012
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Good speakers

1013
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
Talk show host like you

1014
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
Yourself

1015
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
Yes it is

1016
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,919
Ohio

1017
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
475

1018
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
I'll try it

1019
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,511
475

1020
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
3210

1021
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
As far as

1022
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Don't know anything

1023
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,839
What's wrong with Iowa

1024
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:48,191
Couple times nice state

1025
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
I never enjoyed

1026
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
It's fine it's I bend

1027
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,383
I don't know why you need to fire shots at it though Alex in particular

1028
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
Sure sure

1029
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Why I should say I have been looking

1030
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
Through Alex

1031
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
His current radio Philly

1032
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
Play it's open doing a little bit of checking in on that

1033
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
I can say with

1034
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,135
Confidence in Iowa now

1035
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,511
0 stations in Iowa stations in Ohio

1036
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
Four letter states are not going well for Alex these days

1037
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
Might be 0

1038
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
I think there might be something like outside boss

1039
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,455
Not Cambridge download

1040
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:38,111
It's a has I just as much of a presence in Iowa as he did in 2004 that

1041
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,671
So yeah it's

1042
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,255
Give you tickets at a national park

1043
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
You got to talk to the aliens

1044
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,375
I can't figure out how to hear you on the radio

1045
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,167
And also I'm speaking into Mex

1046
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:56,287
What what a smorgasbord of all the things that shouldn't be going

1047
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
Yeah you know it's interesting cuz

1048
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,175
Turn on the episode and I hear Randy Weaver is going to be out of my kisses

1049
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
Huge

1050
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
Pretty big deal

1051
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:09,343
Is a diamond in the rough we randomly stumbled across it

1052
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
Zoe

1053
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
PT

1054
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Colon

1055
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
Slash

1056
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
Switch Lite

1057
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Is it forward slash inspected

1058
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,071
Can you put in the address

1059
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
You have to hit enter

1060
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,447
All right don't forget the right.com

1061
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
We've already noticed a couple times

1062
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Is this sarcasm

1063
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
Alex is using

1064
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,847
And it really is incessant

1065
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,895
It is essentially his only rhetorical.

1066
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,719
Well I don't know I just

1067
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
Good

1068
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Don't like small confined areas is

1069
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,071
Especially if I'm locked out of my guess

1070
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,447
Yeah well not me they're not

1071
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
Laika

1072
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,663
I prefer Verbal Intercourse bearing back in

1073
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Imports but if they want to get

1074
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,991
My face is a gun I'm going to meet you

1075
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
You know I'm saying

1076
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,743
Also they come to me with a ticket I have a gun

1077
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,071
You have clearly decided to respond with a gun

1078
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,143
Not all not all my numbers

1079
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
I think Alex uses this

1080
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Sort of

1081
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
Technique

1082
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
A lot

1083
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,871
Over the top on this episode

1084
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
Maya the English teacher that I cried it with a

1085
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Helping me become a writer

1086
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Doing that whole

1087
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,367
He used to tell me that sarcasm was a

1088
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
The two of the Wii

1089
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,719
To which I said Sarkozy

1090
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,327
And I wish you could be any more of a teacher we became friends until

1091
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:01,983
It's I mean I think people use it as a way to express that they're on

1092
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
Uncomfortable without feeling like there we

1093
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,103
You know Soul sounding like that

1094
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,455
I don't mean because I don't mean we can message rat mean like they're not

1095
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,223
They're not

1096
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,271
Being dominated in some way you know like

1097
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,367
I'm still a person of equal standing with you even though I feel like I'm

1098
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Not doing well in this

1099
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Situation

1100
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:24,255
That got it

1101
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
A little easier than

1102
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
Kind of more creative

1103
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Cleverness

1104
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
Alex Penza and his conversation with Randy

1105
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
And

1106
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
He's plugging

1107
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
Here

1108
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
This feels right

1109
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,151
Before I do

1110
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,623
And I'll read all the news article

1111
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:32,351
I got to find that break down a 1984

1112
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:38,751
What's the f*** you going to spend the rest of tonight like really trying to find

1113
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
And then secondly the

1114
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,359
Her point that here is that

1115
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
This is what he should be doing

1116
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,503
He should have his website that has a subscription aspect to it

1117
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
And you know why he can't

1118
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Don't want to pay for this s***

1119
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
We couldn't get people

1120
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,439
Go to subscribe to his content

1121
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,047
Because they don't want to they bought it for free they want to passively

1122
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
Engage with a to be like

1123
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,631
Look at this guy

1124
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
You gallon gallon things I like

1125
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Righttime

1126
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,239
Maybe I'll buy a pill

1127
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Southpoint

1128
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,079
Alex's tricked me into thinking I need

1129
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,383
Right it is it is a little bit like his

1130
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,735
Pill business's success is actually a reveal that his content is worthless

1131
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
You know

1132
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,623
I think there's something to be

1133
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Be sad for

1134
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
You know

1135
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
Providing your content

1136
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,999
For free obviously that I'll be in many

1137
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
I-i'm

1138
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
I'm big into

1139
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,375
I think this Alex just

1140
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,423
Wouldn't be able to get anyone to give us

1141
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,239
You can give this stuff out for free

1142
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
And get enough views on it

1143
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079
Terms of anybody being like

1144
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Oh yeah

1145
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,663
I'll go in for this I'll get us some

1146
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
Directions to his website

1147
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
Clearly doesn't move the needle

1148
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,039
He couldn't do that anymore that's

1149
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
Kind of sad

1150
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Yeah because this is the model

1151
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
This is

1152
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
This is the model for him

1153
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,279
Everything that he says little f****** blowed somewhere

1154
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
You don't need him

1155
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Nope nope

1156
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
Nope, don't need his pills

1157
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,727
What do you need from him why do you keep going back to him

1158
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
Cuz you're in an abusive relationship

1159
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,823
Ship with a weird cult leader

1160
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,919
No you're in a social relationship with a weird cult leader

1161
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,015
I thought we were in the morning

1162
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,367
Yeah I just I thought I find

1163
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Interesting

1164
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,975
Vaped this was there and it could have

1165
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
Ben what he

1166
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
He does yeah

1167
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
Buddy

1168
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Just now pills

1169
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
Play this is even after like x with gold sales and

1170
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,239
Stuff right now

1171
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,031
You still involved at Anderson

1172
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
B

1173
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Maybe he just really dreamed it

1174
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
At this point that is content was valuable

1175
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,807
Well you know maybe this was a situation where he saw that maybe this was the model

1176
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
And if he can sing

1177
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Succeed at that witch

1178
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Which is what he's trying

1179
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
To do that he can succeed

1180
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
And then he realized that his s*** is s***

1181
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,511
I'm so he started walking

1182
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,815
Yeah it may be

1183
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Do you still

1184
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
That's true

1185
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
Water filter

1186
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
Sponsor on

1187
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
But it's

1188
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,743
This person to answer the phone

1189
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,351
I will be the person who talks to you yesterday do a little mini infomercial

1190
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,679
I don't know I just think it's like

1191
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
Obviously if it works

1192
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
He would still be doing it

1193
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,543
If it made enough money

1194
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,103
This would be the way he operated

1195
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,943
And whether it is because it wasn't enough or because he is

1196
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
Driven by greed

1197
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:05,087
He moved on to something that made a million

1198
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:09,183
Could very well be that we're leaving out the intense possibility that

1199
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
He was

1200
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,767
Successful at this business model.

1201
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Yeah but not

1202
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,327
Billionaire

1203
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,167
And that is to me indicative of somebody who's not driven by

1204
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
The supposed mission

1205
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,007
Yeah but he claims to be on because

1206
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
This is a perfect

1207
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Microwave

1208
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,359
To be able to disseminate the information

1209
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,175
Support base

1210
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
That is organic

1211
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
From the audience

1212
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
And still not have your boss

1213
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,039
And mop

1214
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:40,415
Poison people with iodine with monsters monsters

1215
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,231
And then back yourself into all kinds of weird

1216
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
Narrative

1217
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Based on

1218
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
What you support

1219
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,679
Yeah that's that doesn't seem like you know he was building the very walls

1220
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Even then

1221
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
That contain him now

1222
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
Randy Weaver says

1223
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,639
He doesn't so Alex is another Gaston

1224
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Actually this

1225
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,247
God was really revelatory for me because it helped me realize

1226
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Why

1227
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
He was doing that stupid

1228
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,575
Clockwork Orange

1229
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,647
Narrative that led into everyone's going to be

1230
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:16,767
We forced check cuz it was all just setting the table for this

1231
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,239
I'm just grateful Allen

1232
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
Having me on

1233
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
So now

1234
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
Great because

1235
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,919
This show has structure

1236
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
This episode has a meaning.

1237
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Structure

1238
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
That makes

1239
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Sense

1240
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
It's all bulshit

1241
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
But it makes sense

1242
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,135
Yes now he has this b*******

1243
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:21,279
Story about everybody being forced to be on antipsychotic meds medication

1244
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Psychologist

1245
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Doctor breeding

1246
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
Story serves

1247
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
That's why he

1248
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
He's covering

1249
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,263
There is a narrative structure and art

1250
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
He's Park

1251
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:38,431
Talking about this lady who had a marshmallow out at Yellowstone because he has Randy Weaver on

1252
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
These are stories

1253
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
That are meant to connect

1254
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
The guest

1255
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
He has on

1256
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,391
They are setting the table laying the groundwork for these guests

1257
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
And whatever

1258
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,487
Propaganda narrative bulshit they're going to bring to the table

1259
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,791
Make it more easy for them to have a jump off

1260
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,327
Point something in the news

1261
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
To be a touchstone stone for them

1262
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
It makes sense business

1263
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,679
Discraft

1264
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
Yeah yeah I mean

1265
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
Repeat it so

1266
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,055
Add for us to talk about it

1267
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,359
But this is how you would produce a show

1268
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:14,527
Yeah because I listen to so much of his show and

1269
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,063
Often times these

1270
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,599
Sweetly bulshit

1271
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
Off the Wall White

1272
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,415
The f*** are you talking about this story

1273
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,951
It's not connected to anything

1274
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
And in this case

1275
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
It makes total sense

1276
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,327
Two stories that are off the wall

1277
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,351
Meaningless

1278
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
Why are you talking about this

1279
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,423
It's because of your guess

1280
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
That is leads me to suspect

1281
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:41,663
Use production and crafts goes into it

1282
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
And he's covered

1283
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Bring the story to be

1284
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
A gift for this

1285
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,783
Easier to interview

1286
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,343
I am a cancel until you just had

1287
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Covered some

1288
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,671
Bulshit story that means nothing

1289
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Wait

1290
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
Was that I don't remember

1291
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
I was trying to figure out if you got to give it up

1292
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,887
The Somali pirates who is

1293
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
It was an it was capped

1294
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
Ben Phillips it was later released posed to be him right

1295
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
In the movie

1296
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,783
Developer interview

1297
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
What was it like

1298
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
Well I'm going to be honest

1299
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,695
I got to give it up to the Somali pirates on this one

1300
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,999
This guy doctor breeding

1301
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
When is an auntie meds

1302
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583
Psychologist that believed

1303
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,887
He has a philosophy that is

1304
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Wild

1305
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703
Colts make better horses

1306
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,519
Or something and so it's like essentially

1307
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
The the

1308
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
Argument is

1309
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Hey let your kids be nice

1310
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,151
Yeah

1311
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Crazy

1312
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
I think

1313
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
Bit of something to that and within reach

1314
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,647
I think you know you do have to understand the kids make mistakes and

1315
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,183
Act up in Waze

1316
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
Is that like

1317
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
Maybe as an adult you like

1318
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
The f*** but

1319
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
There's also

1320
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
The emotional distress

1321
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,447
So they could be manifested through kids acting out

1322
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,007
They should be taken much more seriously than just

1323
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
Hey kids will be kids

1324
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,615
See this is why you don't want people like dr. breeding using idiom

1325
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
Sounds like a wild Colt

1326
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,175
Let's make better horses

1327
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,991
Is because on the one hand you could say oh well this means giving

1328
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
Children's ability to run free

1329
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
Will allow them to become better if you know

1330
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Adam the other hand you could take that as saying like

1331
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,951
Listen if they die they die

1332
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:35,839
God gives us who wins and who dies well I mean it's kind of Scott Adams

1333
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
Open ComEd

1334
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,655
About to have you have to watch

1335
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
Kid become a

1336
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Killer Hornets

1337
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Kill them

1338
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
If he dies he dies

1339
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,103
That's all that's all I know

1340
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:53,759
You should have a gun at loaded with you for any time somebody's like wild horses

1341
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
No problem

1342
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
That's how you spell problem

1343
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Channels off

1344
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
Yeah that did go a little bit of rice

1345
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:36,767
To become

1346
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Yeah

1347
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,887
Yeah but I think I'll so you know this

1348
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Kind of Illustrator

1349
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Of this

1350
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495
Long-standing inconsistent

1351
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Stream and nonsense

1352
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,567
Opposition

1353
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
Into public school

1354
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Existed

1355
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Just just

1356
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,431
Anything that

1357
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,455
Challenges

1358
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,271
The legitimacy and not just that

1359
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Of their world.

1360
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
Even if it's just like

1361
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,879
Hey baby

1362
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:07,487
Don't pull a gun out on a ticket you know like even if it's just that they're like

1363
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:13,887
We go back to this again like with the opposition to psych meds and stuff being

1364
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
Detrimental to Their audience

1365
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Retention

1366
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Same thing with

1367
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,311
Education is detrimental to their audio

1368
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Pretension

1369
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,175
Don't hold up to the experiences that you have

1370
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Live with

1371
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,479
Public education

1372
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,039
The people you interact with

1373
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
The

1374
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,623
I'm not being under the influence of your parents

1375
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
At all timer and they can kind of have an eye on you being

1376
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
Being able to

1377
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:39,999
Create

1378
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
Through a social

1379
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
Structure that dust

1380
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
Include

1381
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
The oppressive religion of your parents

1382
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
It's being pushed

1383
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Latino party

1384
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
They like to have that can

1385
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,983
Control over children

1386
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,799
Schools going to be

1387
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
Kids in beds

1388
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
Being experimented upon

1389
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
That would be almost preferable

1390
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
And it's nonsense

1391
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:06,879
It should work on that screenplay there's still time cuz this has not happened

1392
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,511
Oh they were aliens come on get out of here

1393
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,535
Also this

1394
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,071
Caller calls in

1395
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
He's an interesting story about school

1396
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,959
I don't know what's going on here but I found a story in

1397
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
Weather

1398
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
I pick the kids up on time

1399
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,079
Hayward

1400
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
52

1401
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,015
What it called when you go in like the whole school goes I have a big

1402
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,831
Meet up in the cafeteria and what else

1403
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Giving out there getting out

1404
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
No anything

1405
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
Educational

1406
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,879
4

1407
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:17,791
You notice they are when Alex said it's a 17 preschools the guy was trying to correct him but it wasn't

1408
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
What's preschool making up details

1409
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
Yeah well he

1410
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
Right right

1411
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,783
Like we live in a society where it's

1412
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
Promote

1413
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Powers an idiot

1414
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,183
At mediocre people don't even know what they

1415
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
I didn't even think about it

1416
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,095
And I look at on the

1417
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
Look on Aaron and who the kids

1418
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,983
Show the picture of two kids

1419
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
Working together in spine

1420
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
Play right now.

1421
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
On the fence

1422
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
It shows us Dying Light

1423
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,783
Blue jeans

1424
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
Shirt and a construction

1425
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
Is happening

1426
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,839
We need your help

1427
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
What

1428
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,679
I don't know what this is about but like

1429
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
I could see some

1430
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
Kind of

1431
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,263
Like

1432
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:36,639
It's something being misconstrued like it being an observational exercise or something like that

1433
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
Like you know

1434
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Having kids

1435
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:46,367
See something and then be able to describe it right something Brave rather I see that being an

1436
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Occasional exercise of some sort

1437
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,743
But also to the premise of like this being anything groundbreaking

1438
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:57,887
Like using it the whole thing from like 1930s magazines of like Spike it's being in the

1439
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,983
Invisible ink in the back of the magazine.

1440
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,799
Things will be total rip-off Caesar not

1441
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:09,151
Real X-Ray glasses

1442
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,711
Ivy something that's been popular among

1443
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,039
Kids for time immemorial

1444
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:21,439
Hard to B hard to be like all those 30s adventure stories of those kids didn't have any

1445
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,535
But that's why there are like constant stories about like

1446
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
Harriet the Spy

1447
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,863
The archetype of

1448
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,471
Team little kid defensive pedia goddamn Brown

1449
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,567
These things are are popular for a reason it's because kids gravitate towards that

1450
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,103
In the same way they like

1451
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
To play

1452
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Pirate

1453
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
So what would it be

1454
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:48,831
Flexible spike it it would he be happier if they handed out like a Hardy Boys novel where they did invest

1455
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,903
Notice notice what does I really thought he said

1456
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,231
It's my kids though so I kept thinking it was the Robert Rodriguez movies

1457
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,791
Starring Antonio Banderas and his like

1458
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,119
Can you really be that mad at this movie

1459
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,423
I think the timeline might be off

1460
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,775
Come out yet I don't know

1461
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Look

1462
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
I also don't know what this guy's talking about because he

1463
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
He seems to be saying that they gave them microphone

1464
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,039
There's no way they'll be cost-prohibitive there's no way they're giving microphone

1465
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
Kids giving them those like old-fashioned song Michael have the little Echo

1466
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:30,047
Start just like the tube with a little ice cream cone on top

1467
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,095
Did you ever have those

1468
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:38,751
So it's like a little microphone cream Coronavirus

1469
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
Is plastic

1470
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,591
And it has like the little microphone top on it

1471
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,359
In Oaks

1472
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,967
And it was hollow inside and when you spoke into it the sound with echo in the chamber and it would come out like

1473
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
No idea what he's talking about

1474
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Anyway

1475
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Read one last clip

1476
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,975
He does not still believe he seems not to still believe this

1477
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
I don't think this is s***

1478
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
It's been over four billion dollars in

1479
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
Strongly connected to

1480
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,079
Bush senior Bush

1481
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,615
Jr in St Louis

1482
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
Political appointees

1483
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,903
Wow

1484
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
Schizophrenia is real

1485
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,231
That's a man who's been told he is

1486
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
Bentley accuses people of being scared

1487
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,679
He throws it around just as a pejorative

1488
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,983
4 people

1489
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,847
I understand you're trying to do is frame something

1490
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
These drug companies of created

1491
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,687
Condition

1492
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,991
Or whatever

1493
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
I don't think

1494
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
That Alex actually believe

1495
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
I think this is

1496
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,599
Indicative of him

1497
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Just talkingshit

1498
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,671
I need something that serves

1499
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,743
The s*** talking that he's doing with Doctor breeding until he's making

1500
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,047
Like I claim those

1501
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
Responsible

1502
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,887
And audience

1503
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Maybe some of them

1504
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,703
Here then be like that isn't real

1505
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,823
Maybe some people in his audience have people in their lives been diagnosed or themselves

1506
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,663
I'm hearing something like that it's not even a real thing

1507
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,247
Right they can be it can be pretty irresponsible pretty dangerous

1508
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
Yeah I mean

1509
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,575
The thing with that is

1510
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:32,159
Once you start cutting away at what is and is not

1511
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,719
Based on whatever he decides

1512
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
Then it's it's all up

1513
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,047
You know like if he gets

1514
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,607
It's this AOL schizophrenia is not real just cuz I get

1515
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,447
Get to say it he can say that anything is not ready but mental illness

1516
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:50,847
That's just not real you're just wasting all of your time on that you know you understand that's parcel of the position that he's at

1517
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:57,247
Giving himself in his profession because Alex is the Arbiter of like this Secret

1518
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Information that he's able to

1519
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,551
To decode

1520
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
From the globalist

1521
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,367
He in essence

1522
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,183
Is positioned himself as someone who gets

1523
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,767
Dictate the terms of reality for these people listening

1524
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,327
And the way he does that is so irresponsible

1525
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,119
Call ended the way it manifests

1526
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:17,215
18 things like this schizophrenia isn't even real

1527
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,751
Is abusive

1528
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,847
Yeah for the position that he's put himself in

1529
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
He feels no

1530
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,895
Responsibility

1531
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
To take care of

1532
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,247
The people that he is put into the position of like

1533
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,271
They get there

1534
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
Experience reality through him

1535
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:38,207
Totally and if you're if you hear that the only responsible thing to do is like literally stop everything and be like okay fine

1536
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,559
You don't think schizophrenia is real what is real and what is not let's go down the DSM f******

1537
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,887
4 and then you can tell me what you except

1538
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,263
Doctor breeding doesn't even do that he's not he's not stopping out

1539
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Looks to be like well

1540
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,687
Like I understand you have some grievances with maybe you're going a little far here for once in our lives

1541
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Let's team up

1542
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,271
41 in the positive column

1543
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,855
As we allow the 1 billion served in the negative condo

1544
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Tell Colin to keep going

1545
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:15,583
Batman sounds

1546
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,607
That man is dead

1547
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,191
We got attacked by a literal Wild.

1548
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,239
Well you tried to give a Randy Weaver ticket

1549
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
