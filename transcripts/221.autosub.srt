1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Look up a little bit by Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
The f*** is going on

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
I can't answer that question that's sad interview questions

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,512
Star last episode

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,864
I don't feel good about it because we were operating under the contacts

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Quit cuz when we recorded it

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,728
That the Roses mailbox

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
Was a isolated

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
I kind of was operating under that

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:53,760
Other than the fact of you and so

12
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,856
Posted that episode 130 or so on Tuesday night

13
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Putting episode up

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
Went to bed woke up in the morning

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,584
Computer see how the world is doing

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
The first headliner

17
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
It's crazy because like on Monday

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
I'll get some sleeping

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,176
I sleep I wake up

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,136
In the past three days every time we have gone to sleep

21
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,024
I refuse to make that connection necessarily

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Thrown around then the very Act

23
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Sleep is causing

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,496
Recovering Alex Jones at the present

25
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,360
Because he's so full of s*** in the world is so crazy right now

26
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,944
The present are almost instantly data

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
They're almost

28
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,856
Instantly but don't have the full picture just by virtue of

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
How everything changes on a diamond

30
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
I don't

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
You know I see all these other people

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Bob

33
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
The people

34
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
It's still all people that screams about all of the time

35
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
I don't unique

36
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
These are all people that Alex yells about because the right-wing world has

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Become so Alex defied

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
So who don't spot

39
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
That

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
Who's going to let that

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
I was intentionally did that while you're taking a step

42
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
It's become so much that

43
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Become such a blur as to like

44
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
What could motivate

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
To the point where honestly

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
The only way I would be

47
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Convinced that this is Alex Jones motivated

48
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
Not prompt Tucker Carlson all that

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
Just be whole world of the right motivated

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
As if Brian stelter got

51
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Alex is probably the only person she'll there all the time

52
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Control group

53
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Situation

54
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Scorsese

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
See

56
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Wildwood DeNiro get

57
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Obama along with everybody else

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
I'll tell you why this whole thing is just a mask

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
That Scorsese is pissed off

60
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
The DeNiro spent those twenty years in the wilderness

61
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
Klumps movie

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Look Who's Talking Now

64
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,672

Bless your job

71

Also would like to say thank you to somebody who came in a little bit of a higher level

72
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
I appreciate it also very much

73
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Reverse

74
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
You are now at

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Technocrat

76
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Dogs get mad and tell her you're brilliant someone sodomite sent me a bucket

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Has a Caribbean

78
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
I don't want

79
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
You're Oliver

80
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
Thank you very much Oliver

81
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
So much I knew you like to meet

82
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
We will have our breakdown coming up in the near future

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,751
I realize I looked at the vote totals there's no way for me to justify

84
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,335
The will of the people is The Obama Deception

85
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Coming up

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
And also there's a

87
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
The time of our website content that will be coming up

88
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
We reach that next goal

89
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
That is

90
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Driving me crazy

91
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
But

92
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
For now

93
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
I'm at the top of the show

94
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
That we didn't have all the information at our disposal

95
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
When we did our last episode

96
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
And unfortunately I thought well the only responsible thing

97
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
To do is now that there's more of the story available as much as its

98
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
Talk about a present-day episode

99
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
I feel like it's our responsibility to jump in

100
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
And do another present day episode

101
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
To go over what Alex Jones is talking about now

102
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,367
Could be the October 24th episode 200 from Wednesday

103
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,231
In this first clip we're going to be listening to hear Alex is talking to Owen Shroyer

104
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
About the situation

105
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
What is unfolded all around

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,959
Did you sweep of other houses

107
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Those for March 12th of this year during the Austin

108
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
Totally mixed up.

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Actually the first clip

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Erica

111
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
Propaganda

112
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
People in Congress

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Michaels

114
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
Talk show host

115
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm sorry I f***** up again that was from April 20th 2010

116
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Now that's two in a row

117
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
And

118
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Coincidence

119
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
I need three to form a pattern and then I will know whether or not this is going in a Direction

120
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
Honestly it was my intention to just do that the entire episode

121
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,087
Like that would be a way that we could Escape actually talking about the present but I'm horny

122
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,207
My archives of Clips are much more difficult to go through then I would like to

123
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
You like to think

124
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Two that I pulled their to demonstrate like alright

125
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
Whatever you talk about bomb goes the same way

126
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
I always fall swag stuff

127
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
I don't know if I can

128
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
I don't know

129
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,871
From October 4th 2018

130
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
And it's a little bit of a pre-taped thing

131
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
With Rodger Stone

132
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
And you'll see you'll see the vibe

133
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
He's putting out here

134
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Say something

135
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Rodger Stone

136
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
Emperors

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
We do not want any violence

138
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Bryant

139
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639

00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,231
It is not

146
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
False flag

147
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
With the goal

148
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
A blaming alley

149
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
I think we just did

150
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
Mission accomplished raise at banner up we did it

151
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
Cuz you can hear about Rodger stone that he's like a little bit more using legal language

152
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
Be a little bit of the mind of legal action characters living or dead

153
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
Play called for violin

154
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
The specific people who were bombed

155
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,055
Represent Alex Jones or Rodger Stone despite the fact

156
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Countless

157
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Numbers of times

158
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Called for direct violence

159
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:31,135
Political violence he never has that always been

160
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
January 5th 2018

161
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Disingenuous

162
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Perpetrator

163
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,103
He will.

164
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Scalp

00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,759
Senior Living

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Understand that

167
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,743
Skelter

168
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:14,911
Advocating violence

169
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Demon and that means

170
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Is that you was immoral

171
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Send have

172
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
No choice

173
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
It's like in The Exorcist where the Exorcist

174
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
The demon was like

175
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
Call William

176
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Peacefully

177
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
Of course that's a little vague and stuff like that but

178
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
Here's a clip from March 20th of this year

179
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
Judicial

180
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,111
So president to take covert action against his supposed enemies

181
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
I believe that

182
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Legal for him to kill these

183
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Come on

184
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,191
Fair enough

185
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Alex's

186
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
I'm totally against violence and you can never save it

187
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Encourage anything

188
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Anybody who says I encourage violence

189
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Fill your hand

190
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
I'll beat your ass

191
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
Play with Rodger clearly preemptive

192
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Damage control

193
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
Because I think that they probably got the sense of like

194
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
We better put out where we literally say if somebody.

195
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,175
They should really have opened every show with that videos

196
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,623
It's really fun here is that in that clip

197
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
You forgot

198
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Cut out of it

199
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Showers

200
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Why did you keep that in

201
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Why didn't you cut that out

202
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,471
He said move

203
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,871
Alex

204
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
You got it you got to come up with more than two

205
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
Yeah I got to work a little harder on that day

206
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
You chicken

207
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Right

208
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
What

209
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
How would you how would you spell literally

210
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Is there anybody

211
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Decry

212
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
You bet

213
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,615
And that is not

214
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
I'll miss you talking about stuff

215
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Actually I'm Studio not in the

216
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
Broadcasting worldwide

217
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
2019 historical action

218
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
Obama

219
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
CNN evacuated George Soros

220
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,215
Right on time so they can play the victim

221
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
The ground

222
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,807
50000 people

223
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,255
From usaid

224
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
The George Soros doesn't pay for it

225
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
The US taxpayer through the UN

226
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
Is that wood donations run the operation

227
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
And there they are

228
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Dislike

229
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
We predicted to slam into the Border

230
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
2 days before the election

231
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
They'll be more than 200,000 people

232
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,023
50000 now

233
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
The other day was around there

234
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
I've made this point

235
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Alex

236
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
Everything is an exaggeration

237
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
But it's exactly what I expected

238
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Define. Tuesdays show

239
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Until Wednesday

240
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
To come out with this narrative

241
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Because if the obvious narrative

242
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:30,047
It's his knee jerk reaction is already rolling on Tuesday

243
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
The false flag I bet you

244
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Next are going to say that it was Clinton

245
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,847
Threatened

246
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
But instead

247
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
I don't know what it is like

248
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:51,039
I know that on the last episode I said that there's no Universe I believe exists that Alex

249
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Didn't know about Soros getting a bomb made me not know I wonder if maybe

250
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
I think it might be possible

251
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,351
Wednesday instead of Tuesday

252
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
That makes no sense

253
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
No-shows are heavily scripted

254
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,615
They do dress rehearsal breakfast

255
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,687
Is that the case

256
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,831
Professional

257
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,927
Who did all the block

258
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
I don't care about breaking news

259
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
Absolutely

260
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:44,287
Worldwide I am your host Alex Jones

261
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,151
413 days out from the midterm elections and all hell is breaking loose

262
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Obviously

263
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Coming up

264
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Dozens and dozens of clips

265
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
Imma show you the news articles for yourself here in a moment

266
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Precisely

267
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,751
They are preparing the public

268
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,823
A conservative media

269
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
They are terrorists

270
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
Who are going to attack the media

271
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
University

272
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Democratic

273
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,743
Jury's out on that one just say that collections are illegitimate and that we are going to

274
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,047
Cause all of this violence

275
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
I wouldn't say the last one

276
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,495
This is a situation where like you just get into this stupid game

277
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
I'm out

278
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Because

279
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,711
What he's describing is the media covering

280
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
Trumps rhetoric

281
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
Alex is rhetoric

282
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
That they're saying

283
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Hey you know History A lot of times people and demonize a certain population that populate

284
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Ended up getting

285
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
For marginalized even further than they already were

286
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
Weather in this case journalist

287
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
You know when countries that have slipped away from democratic principles largely the first step down that road is

288
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,151
Demonizing the media

289
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
Throughout Eastern Europe and tons of countries the idea of

290
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Free Press

291
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
Is one of the most dangerous things to our crew

292
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,903
So like when you have that

293
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,255
The media covers it in such a way that says hey

294
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Really

295
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
Not good

296
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
And there's

297
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
Exact rate

298
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
The stimulus there's literally no difference

299
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,335
Between the reality of the media warning about something and Alex

300
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
They're trying to demonize

301
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,943
Did the middle like what make

302
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,039
What makes both sides do what they do is this

303
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
It's just that one sides

304
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Defensive and full of s***

305
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
I was really nothing

306
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
You can do about that

307
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
There's nothing you can do about it

308
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
I was just be like how you're awesome

309
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Here's the most

310
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
Obvious

311
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Reason that these guys

312
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
No the rhetoric is Viola

313
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Annie's

314
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Causing

315
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Violin

316
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
They are defending

317
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,711
Before we know anything about who sent

318
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:37,343
You texted me that and I thought that was like such a good distillation of this like all you need to know

319
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,695
They didn't even wait for a 5 Second

320
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
They might not be at fault for this one

321
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
They might be fun

322
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,495
But this might be a false flag

323
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
I think the odds

324
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
I agree minuscule but I would even

325
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
Trinkets

326
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
But the nature of whoever is doing this

327
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Do right-wing media Outlet

328
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Atolls

329
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
None of them are even saying

330
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
Hold on and find out

331
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,351
Who's done this before we

332
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
Terrorism admitting

333
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
Alex is responsible for this in a spiritual sense

334
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
No matter what they are

335
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
I still I still think that Alex

336
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Has helped us get to

337
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
To the point in terms of the rhetoric

338
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Acceptable

339
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
That sort of thing

340
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
B that weekend Where We Are

341
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
I didn't

342
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,959
I don't think it would be appropriate for us to be like this guy for sure

343
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
We can we can have

344
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
I would like

345
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,383
Looks like it

346
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
For that would be

347
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Stupid

348
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,295
This affects the entire right-wing

349
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Media sphere

350
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
People who were like

351
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Formerly

352
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
Had the pretenses like I'm not Alex Jones people like Rush Limbaugh

353
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
None of them have even come out and been like

354
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
It could just be alone crazy

355
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,896
None of them have even given any other

356
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Sabila

357
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,552
But I think you're I think you're totally right that does indicate

358
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
It's like we got to get

359
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
In front of this thing

360
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,416
Because otherwise when the truth comes out we're f***

361
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
And that's a strategy

362
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
How do you say I think a lot of

363
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
These people Hitler

364
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,352
For propaganda so that's not good

365
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:02,240
Now it is clear that the bombings

366
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
The attempted bombing

367
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
All of these Democrats

368
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Robert De Niro

369
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Debbie Wasserman Schultz

370
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,480
Yep you know it's just

371
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
It's balloon from where it was

372
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,928
Yeah and he said that it's it's fake

373
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:26,304
And it is clearly as I'm doing it to themselves because I need sympathy in the other midterms

374
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
And he's going

375
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
Be blamed for it

376
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Bank line

377
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Narrative

378
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
But in order to make his

379
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
He needs to link it to another bomb

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Of recent day

381
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
And if this is this is a bad

382
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,880
Wards.com

383
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Tours.com

384
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Is that

385
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
A pipe bomb got mailed yesterday I'm very small little pipe

386
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
Another similar to CNN

387
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Wanda Obama

388
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
And one of course to the clintons

389
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
We are in New York

390
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
Remember if you go back

391
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,464
About a month ago at gentleman was busted New York

392
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
Cooking up a

393
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
A true

394
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Hundred

395
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Spaceman

396
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
The bomb the Republicans to cancel the election

397
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
Inside

398
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
Washington Monument Mall

399
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
On the morning of election day

400
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Try to cancel the election

401
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,480
Because the Republicans are going to try to steal the election

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,808
That doesn't make sense either crazy laptops

403
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,904
So that's really bad

404
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
And here's why

405
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
Alex is juxtaposing the stories of all of his enemies receiving mail bombs with a story about this guy out of New York

406
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,424
Building a 200 lb

407
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
He's doing

408
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,008
I'm claiming that the man was deranged left

409
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Because doesn't know anything but

410
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
This false narrative serves his purposes

411
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
Resent the idea that the Soros Clinton Obama

412
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
False flag by the left

413
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
The problem is that Paul Rosen

414
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,808
Built that bomb was not elect

415
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,672
Nor is it any mystery as to what his intentions were in planning to blow up

416
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,512
He wasn't angry the Republicans is Alex's reporting

417
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,584
At least he was no more angry with

418
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
From the FBI press release

419
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:44,032
Quote in August and September 2018 Rosenfeld sent letters and text messages to an individual in Pennsylvania

420
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:49,920
These letters in text messages stated that Rosenfeld plan to build an explosive device and detonated on November 6th

421
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,968
2018 International ball

422
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
DC

423
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,600
Rosenfeld's

424
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,696
AB litical theories advocates for the random selection of government official

425
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Alright

426
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Alright

427
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Val

428
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,120
Closer to you now interested

429
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
He's not like to build a bomb

430
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,264
To do this but I read some of his

431
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
It doesn't come off as crazy as a lot of the manifestos you end up repeating him

432
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
I have no idea about that

433
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
Seems like it'd be hard to build a home-brewed 200lb bomb that's big

434
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,952
It's hard to build a loaded in a van

435
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,328
Bacon

436
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
It's 200 lb

437
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Let alone Obama

438
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
You know

439
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Stuff

440
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
But I mean

441
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
The cake

442
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
I mean obviously

443
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:56,480
No no no more dangerous a lot of difficulties

444
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,296
Country was going in the wrong direction

445
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,136
The thing is he felt like that for a long time for Trump

446
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,232
He'd written blog posts years ago called things like the extinction of politic

447
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
And others

448
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,560
It was the only way to go

449
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,888
He opposed the Democratic process as a whole

450
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,704
Which is why you chose election Babe Ruth plant

451
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,800
He's going to kill himself with the bomb

452
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
Timer

453
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
These got hit that thing with a hammer

454
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,712
He broke the majority rule is monarchy

455
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:33,856
The constant political maneuvering of individuals and factions must inevitably winner-takes-all conclusion

456
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,160
Even today despite all our democratic

457
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
Pretensions of the US

458
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,768
One might easily imagine a scenario in which President Bush

459
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,352
Following an active nuclear terrorism suspends the electoral process

460
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Under the pretext that terrorists have a

461
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
Infiltrated the Democratic Party

462
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,520
Perpetual Bush L via plausible outcome

463
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,872
Most people imagine a democracy and monarchy are different animals but they're actually cousin

464
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
You wrote that

465
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:03,552
Before it appeared the truck was going to be the next president

466
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
And Ducks out of the election

467
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Did you mean

468
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Okay

469
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
That sounds exactly like what Alex was saying about Jeb Bush in the 2016 election

470
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,656
Grammar in more developed ideas

471
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,008
Also sortation is a philosophy that is not largely associated with the left

472
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
They're far more

473
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,712
Do you know who it is

474
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,760
Who are generally now like

475
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
They like to hang out with libertarian

476
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,928
I mean like I'm not saying

477
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
Is it

478
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,256
Abate

479
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,072
Like sole possession of the right

480
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,912
Or anything like that it does happen heavy overlap with

481
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,216
People who are anarcho-capitalist to art

482
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Liberal

483
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
Philosophy involved

484
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Corrosion

485
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
Intentional erosion or getting rid of

486
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
The Democratic process

487
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,712
You're on a whole different Spectrum

488
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
A Venn diagram

489
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
What if

490
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,184
The short story The Lottery button

491
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,232
Instead of getting killed they become leader

492
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
Republican

493
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,632
That's why he was going to blow up a National Mall is

494
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,216
He doesn't know anything about the story but he needs to connect

495
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,824
To his other story idea that all of these bombs are clearly

496
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Some sort of a democratic false flag

497
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
Doesn't matter if it's true or not

498
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,416
That's care about like it

499
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
If you if you want

500
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:47,232
Represent the idea that all

501
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
All these are false Flags

502
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,792
You shouldn't

503
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
Bring up a story to reinforce that belief

504
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Vegeta

505
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
Know anything about a dozen

506
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,800
I wanted to do better is what I'm saying disappointing

507
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
It's 8

508
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Always

509
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
It's always

510
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,272
What bombings are false flags and what bombings are not

511
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,112
A little bit a little bit later

512
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
Seems like

513
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Statistically

514
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
You're right wing bombers can't

515
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Don't tell Alex

516
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,704
YouTube video of left-wing bombers that were false

517
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,776
By the right I still be like

518
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Like for real left-wing

519
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Mercer

520
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
I promise you will get into bombing

521
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,688
Statistics here in a little bit

522
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:44,064
Alex had to take umbrage with the media

523
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,392
For painting him in an unfair light

524
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
Let's go back now

525
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Adjust a few

526
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,840
Weeks ago and a few months ago here's two weeks ago

527
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,008
First person

528
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Terrorist

529
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
Acquired

530
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
Article a v

531
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
So I found that article

532
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,088
The headline is actually the information

533
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
Plural

534
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,512
Mike cernovich all those especially

535
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,120
Confirmation process Article 4

536
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
If it doesn't have anything

537
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Technology

538
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
Information terrorism is not a term I apply lightly

539
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,688
Terrorism is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation

540
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
Especially against civilians in the pursuit of political aims

541
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Refute

542
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:50,880
More apt to describe what this group is Unleashed against their fellow America

543
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Alex has

544
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Brass balls

545
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,000
Complaining about why you're calling him an information terrorist

546
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,072
What is website is called Infowars

547
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
So

548
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:10,592
Information Wars use the definitions of all words

549
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,456
Determine what they mean

550
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,600
Ergo Heathen information because in the information

551
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
Intentionally political result

552
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
ARS now

553
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:38,496
Discuss this idea of information

554
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
It's an interesting concept but

555
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,664
I don't know I don't know how full it is because

556
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
Part of the article

557
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Terrorism is defined as the unlawful

558
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,600
And if you are using that is your definition of terrorism

559
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Spell legal most

560
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Of the things I like

561
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,768
Texas doing

562
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
Particularly distasteful awesome doesn't fall under

563
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Illegal

564
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Maybe that's a minor squabble if you wanted to argue

565
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,688
You why this article is unfair

566
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
And also it is nowhere

567
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,024
Scroll down like four times board

568
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,328
He gets to the picture of himself as I was getting good

569
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
No more pictures

570
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,520
Nerd

571
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
So now all of the right-wing media

572
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Is united in calling the

573
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Little all but all the

574
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
Most

575
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,112
If we apply this to

576
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
I don't know

577
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,720
This would be very similar

578
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
You all of the

579
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
Mustang Las Vegas

580
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
False flag

581
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Sandy Hook was a false

582
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Cosplay

583
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,704
Heather Harris death

584
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
All of these things

585
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Is it

586
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,336
Legally action

587
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
If it's legally UK

588
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Conseil

589
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
We're going to sue Alec

590
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
What's Jones

591
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
For calling

592
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
Sandy Hook a false flag

593
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:36,512
I think that the only people who would have liked standing are the people who receive the bombs

594
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
I think that they have better thing

595
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Things to do

596
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
I really don't if it means they can take down is not a lie

597
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Alex Jones the target is

598
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Fox News

599
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,920
Do you have to you have to realize like how big of a court case that would be that would be the next 10 years

600
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
What else you want that to be I don't think he wants it to be

601
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
Worst Outlet in American history now we see it that way

602
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:13,120
One of them

603
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
Barack Obama

604
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
I think I think a lot of them know that

605
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:24,384
Airbnb such an uphill battle you don't end up having to end up redefining so many

606
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
About

607
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Except if you are one of those

608
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
Cuz I'm broke but sure other reasons probably

609
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,000
I think it'll be a real headache

610
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,864
Alex's reinforces the idea that this is a big old.

611
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
Rocket science

612
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,032
That when they start

613
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:02,272
He said that on 60 Minutes

614
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,880
Yes you didn't you didn't say it clearly

615
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,184
When are the ones calling for violence against him

616
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,328
101

617
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,448
So you know you have a lot of the last carries out violence

618
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
Against

619
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Folks

620
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
100 100

621
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,616
It's a little bit and I'm going to redo this year

622
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,736
Of the global terrorism database by researchers at the University of Maryland published

623
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
In 2070

624
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,552
Increase

625
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,856
In the sheriff attacked by right-wing extremist

626
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
From 6% in the 2000

627
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
35% of 2010

628
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
Hard to imagine what's cause that

629
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
35% it went

630
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:54,496
Of all domestic terrorist act are done

631
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
Spell electoral

632
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,944
What is a scientific study

633
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
I'm assuming

634
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
To be 3500

635
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
3500

636
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,624
Meanwhile the sheriff attacked by left

637
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Strop from 6

638
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Percent in the 2,000

639
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
To 12%

640
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
Emma 2010

641
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
A lot of that is because of

642
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
Like the 64%

643
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
2000

644
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
Is a lot of Eco terrorism

645
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
Animal rights

646
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,896
2016 2016

647
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,712
That's so they wanted to look into it a little bit further

648
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,344
Buy quarts of the same Global terrorism database

649
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
That the trend persisted in 2017

650
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
We're both attacks in the US were committed by right-wing it's

651
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,584
Out of 65 incidents that you're 37 were tied to racist anti-muslim

652
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Homophobic anti-semitic fascist

653
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,936
Anti-government Rosina phobic motivation

654
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
In that same set of data

655
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
11

656
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Explaining actors

657
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
7

658
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,640
6511 we're less leading actor

659
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,016
And a closer review the data shows that six of these left-leaning Terror attacks were done by animal liberation

660
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
So that leaves five

661
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,904
And then there's also Environmental

662
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Almost

663
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Nothing

664
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
BioLife

665
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
Is a very narrow

666
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Picture of

667
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
The court as opposed to the

668
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Rampant

669
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Spraying

670
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Coronavirus

671
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:36,384
Terrorism

672
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:43,296
Right right

673
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Because we're

674
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,648
Dealing with a person leaving Bombs all over

675
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
The place and Alex

676
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,024
Defensive about it and talking about how

677
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
It like that

678
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
I feel like

679
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
It's important to

680
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,704
The only way for the right wing

681
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
To discuss this element

682
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
All the terrorism

683
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,104
Is being done by their side is false flag

684
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
There's literally no other way to avoid looking in the mirror and realizing

685
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
The statistics

686
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
Terrifying

687
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,552
Globally the number of terrorist attacks

688
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Has been on a decline

689
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Since 2014

690
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
17 thousand or so attacks

691
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
In 2014

692
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
As compared to 11,000 or so in 2017

693
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
Is a drop-off going this very

694
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,632
Considerable but in this country that trend has reversed

695
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
In 2015 there were less

696
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
In 2016 and 2017

697
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,800
A win trumps rhetoric has shifted the Overton

698
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
What sort of things are acceptable public speech

699
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
We see that number dropped to 64 and 60

700
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
55in those years

701
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,600
The world is going down

702
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
VCR is going

703
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Way up

704
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
And the share of them

705
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
Being right-wing extremist going

706
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Way up

707
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:03,680
So I mean to talk about this isn't true and that

708
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Or else

709
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
You have to wrestle with the idea that like

710
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Maybe we're doing this

711
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
Maybe this is something that we are responsible

712
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Do that

713
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
If Alex

714
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
And Fox News and

715
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
If they ever actually

716
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
Maybe what we're doing

717
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Is

718
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
Violence

719
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
Right isn't that

720
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Like the biggest problem they have is not

721
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Are we are we

722
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,168
Causing the needless deaths

723
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
AIDS

724
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,544
Look at how popular we are now that we're calling 45

725
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:45,152
It has a lot of ass covering there's a lot of like this is what we do is win

726
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Is my job

727
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
I mean it's

728
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
The digits dehumanization on a mass scale

729
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
Cuz I made you look at you look at the numbers

730
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Not all those attacks

731
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Fatal

732
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
Anything like that

733
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
Good but there are numbers that are

734
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
And

735
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
When you look at that and you realize the human toll

736
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
Numbers represent

737
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
And you realize like oh

738
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
Huh

739
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Maybe

740
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Public

741
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,920
Good stop but

742
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Dollars

743
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
In the place

744
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Because

745
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
This is something

746
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Sing that

747
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,440
Imagine that

748
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Every like

749
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Human Fox

750
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Employee

751
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
On a daily base

752
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
I'm part of

753
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
Yeah I wonder how many of those are left

754
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
I don't know

755
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
Keep working

756
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
I make enough money

757
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
Surviving

758
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Lined up

759
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,200
I might go broke

760
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,832
Probably a moral imperative not to work

761
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Fox News

762
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
That stuff I don't know

763
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:05,792
I don't know I don't know how that would work

764
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Sure

765
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,776
Have been saying that like I've been predicting this

766
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Has has been touting

767
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Tons of proof

768
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Times articles

769
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
To make his own proof

770
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Show

771
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
Platform

772
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,656
Perfect Storm

773
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
To demonize conservative

774
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
It's also Perfect Storm

775
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,824
For conservatives to bomb people

776
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,384
Elections bigger than 11

777
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,919
Three blind on Trump and Alex

778
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Call Joan

779
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:02,111
Emergency

780
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,439
Big check to steal election

781
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
About to be

782
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
Watch

783
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
August 16th

784
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,959
Alex Jones

785
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
False

786
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
August 17th

787
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
Alex Jones warns Applebaum Federal Building

788
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,319
And here we are two months later I told you I got tribe

789
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,135
Emergency reporting

790
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
Softball Flags

791
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Two weeks before election

792
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
Call specifically

793
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
Two weeks before launch

794
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
The mom Multiplex

795
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,871
Do you have a clip 3 predicted the summer of Rage predicted that the dollar was about to be

796
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,687
Completely devalued never once

797
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
If you stay things repeatedly and keep

798
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:07,391
Varying up what you're predicting eventually something you're going to have a clip free like

799
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
But I also guarantee that is equipped

800
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,351
Almost before the election I guarantee there's another clip

801
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
The day off

802
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,383
There's a false flag coming now 2015

803
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,991
The further thing that's really important is all those headlines

804
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,831
This is improving anything except that he keeps saying

805
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,903
None of it depicts reality at all

806
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,671
None of it

807
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
At no point in

808
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,791
Does he actually

809
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Reprove

810
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,631
In any way that the media is

811
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,239
Keep saying it and then uses those articles that he and his

812
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
Himself produced

813
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
As evidence

814
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
But I got it right I got it right because this happened

815
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
So

816
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
That he likes to try and present

817
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
The argument that he tries to make about this

818
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Is the

819
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
He's able to make these

820
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Throughout August

821
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
And all this

822
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Is because

823
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
It's like when you see

824
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
Commercials for the McRib

825
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,399
You know that the McRib is coming back okay but the commercials are telling you that the McRib is coming back

826
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:26,495
Right David his rhetoric is dangerous

827
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
And that means to him

828
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,359
I know that that means they're going to false-flag themselves

829
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
To blame me

830
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,199
So he writes all these articles

831
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,527
And then attack happened

832
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Bring

833
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,183
Sooner or later just called is going to get the end-of-the-world right

834
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
In this case

835
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,327
His version of it is this idea of like advertised

836
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
It's like you know McDonald's wants

837
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,471
YouTube I this thing in the future so they prepare you to know that it's coming

838
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Or whatever

839
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
And that's great

840
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,103
Great I'm not going to take away from his argument that's that's super

841
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
For fun

842
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:09,247
Rather related to it I like to talk about Alex's actions of the media

843
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Personally I believe the media is

844
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,367
Pretty accurately warning people about the

845
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,647
Consequences

846
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,927
Of the human icing

847
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
And violent dangerous Reddit

848
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
So when I look at Alex's Behavior

849
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
The media is going to fall swag themselves

850
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
Writing article after article about it

851
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215
It's less

852
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
In advertising

853
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:37,407
And what it is it's more like the PR department at a company that knows they're about to get caught for something

854
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
Yeah you know it's like we know we've been littering and polluting for a long time

855
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:47,647
What is about to put out a report about it

856
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
About how

857
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
The Watchdog group isn't

858
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
There are not credible

859
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,119
They are they have been taking money from interest

860
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Take us down

861
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,727
Because then when that report comes out about the police that they were asked

862
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
You have that to fall back on

863
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,151
Groundwork has been laid before the story comes out and he be like

864
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
Oh no look we're not responding to this story

865
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
We're responding

866
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
Me too like we know that there

867
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
They're dirty

868
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
I said Dad

869
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Who's like

870
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,207
Killed three people in the cops

871
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
But he's like a month out and

872
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
They're going to say a lot of bad thing

873
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
I mean I did kill those

874
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
But none of what they say

875
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
You're going to hear a lot of things

876
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
You don't believe

877
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,687
You don't believe anything anybody tells you but what Daddy

878
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
He says and daddy says

879
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Wait whatever is my business murderer is dead either way that you want to go with

880
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,255
What does

881
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Comes back to is exactly what you're saying

882
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
The beginning

883
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,607
That they know

884
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,399
The end result of their actions

885
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
As well

886
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:08,287
Make all of the post

887
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
I'm talking about the media's going to false flag themselves

888
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
If you didn't have a

889
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
Keen awareness

890
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:20,063
Trump saying the media is the enemy of the American people

891
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,623
Walter and talk about how he

892
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,671
Kill and rape your family

893
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,255
Natural end result of that

894
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
When unhinged person

895
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Here's those sore

896
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
The Natural end result

897
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
Possibly

898
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Someone hurting

899
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,495
This is preemptive damage

900
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
Control4

901
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
It is not

902
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Addicted

903
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
It's not predict

904
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
Except

905
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,407
For the fact that he's predicting that this will

906
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
It is also

907
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Something

908
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
I would say

909
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Trying to make

910
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
Happened

911
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Do the world like

912
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,719
Maybe maybe maybe maybe

913
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
Maybe I don't know I don't know about that I'm only

914
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,327
Hoping you a little bit because I think that's too

915
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:08,191
Too close to Alex's predictive programming ideas

916
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
He knows is that it is

917
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,335
I'm throwing in

918
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
Regardless you know it is it is damaged

919
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Preemptive

920
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
But

921
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
At the same time

922
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
While he's writing those stories

923
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:24,831
There is

924
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,159
And I hope this happy

925
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
So I'm right

926
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
Yeah maybe

927
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
He's never happier

928
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
Then when he gets to say he's right

929
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:46,335
So probably psychological piece of it's like that

930
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,687
Probably doesn't care someone gets hurt to make

931
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,991
Especially

932
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
Rochester

933
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
That's our new shirt

934
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
Like

935
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:10,911
I think that we're kind of getting the idea here that

936
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,495
It's pretty easy to smell through what Alex

937
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Cuz Rider Wrecker Service

938
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
You know it it's pretty easy and his next wife is even more over

939
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
13

940
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
Will be

941
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,695
He visited drudgereport

942
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
Tucker Carlson

943
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
He watched Fox News

944
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,863
You can you can see the scripting at boy we told you

945
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
Jonesy's

946
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
Why

947
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,567
Why he mailed the bombs are or his his somebody

948
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,735
Anxiety that's the right wing that Hillary

949
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,575
Soros and Obama are good guys that

950
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
Or just trying to

951
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
What about the news

952
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
Help America in

953
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,743
We've been resisting them and saying their globalists and self

954
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,071
We would say.

955
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
And so now

956
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,911
With the election 13 days away

957
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
You know they're planning

958
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,639
Now there can be the big event

959
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,455
The group or individuals

960
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,247
Lone Wolf

961
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
That's behind it

962
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Properly blame

963
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
So

964
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
You see there that's

965
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,695
Next

966
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,487
Evening

967
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
Like puns and tons of things

968
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,351
I would say that I know that

969
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
This person

970
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Four-person

971
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Who's responsible

972
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495
Was inspired by Tucker Carlson

973
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,079
Spiritually responsible isn't even the person was

974
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,615
Influence by Alex

975
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,407
Directly

976
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:01,247
All that because he needs to say all of that

977
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
In case any of those things

978
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Is R-Truth

979
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,903
I told you beforehand that they were going to say

980
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
Also there's such a

981
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Which is that like

982
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Right wing

983
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Soyboy

984
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
And the media is trying to portray them all

985
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Good guys

986
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
It doesn't

987
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,295
Matter if they're good guy not at all

988
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,343
Nope

989
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Yeah

990
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
You know like what can't you just start

991
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:44,255
You could just start

992
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
I don't even think

993
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,239
In listening to this episode that I heard him say it's bad

994
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
You know I

995
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:59,103
I didn't even realize that but

996
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,687
You're right. He doesn't think you the disclaimer but that doesn't

997
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
No

998
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,135
It's not on us not on us

999
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Yeah

1000
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:19,327
Is trying to play this game

1001
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
They're trying to get to the

1002
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
For themselves trying to make themselves seem like a victim

1003
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
Demonizing

1004
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
Demonizing

1005
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,287
The false flag

1006
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
You know you got this false wagon the next

1007
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Viola person that did it

1008
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,711
Wyckoff

1009
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,527
Bring out somebody

1010
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Wearing it

1011
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,367
Lock her up shirt

1012
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:47,231
We got a long history of posting on the internet about

1013
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:53,887
Liberal

1014
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,079
Scripted because

1015
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
And it's a script

1016
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,503
Always know that it's because it happens so frequently

1017
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
To be scripted

1018
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,879
Frequently like similar offenders

1019
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:18,719
Similar psychological profiles and patterns

1020
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Statistics

1021
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
Could not track call false flag

1022
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,863
The nature of false-flag stuff

1023
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
From the false flag accusation

1024
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
They get mad when they get

1025
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:31,775
I want things I realize there's a real General Trend among people

1026
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
The claim that thing

1027
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,127
That would tend to make them be seen in a realistic way

1028
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
Are actually elaborate plots

1029
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Against them

1030
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
And there's no better example of this.

1031
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,807
Fallout that happened after the right rally in Charlottesville

1032
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:48,671
Initially the hard-right media Figures were totally fine with the rally and supported

1033
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:53,535
Extension

1034
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:58,143
Gavin McGinnis had the organizer of the rally Jason Kessler on his show to promote

1035
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Alex was firmly in support of the rally

1036
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Absolutely

1037
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,799
The reality of the worlds that they help

1038
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
Facilitate became publicly visible

1039
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,663
Nazis white supremacists and weird fascist

1040
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,991
Were there uniforms unashamed in the light of day

1041
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,319
Heartedly on Alex and Gavin McInnes his side

1042
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Then

1043
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
Heather heyer got murder

1044
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:24,255
Videos of a group of white men beating the s*** out of DeAndre Harris with metal pipes and boards

1045
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:28,095
The obvious to anyone

1046
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Who is looking

1047
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
The situation

1048
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,775
Things didn't get better when it came out that the rally organizer Jason Kessler was

1049
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,847
At least a second-degree member of McGinnis

1050
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:44,223
Immediately McGinnis went to control mode

1051
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,039
And it's becoming too proud boy meetings under false pretense

1052
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:53,695
Tessler being a proud boy was a false flag to associate his definitely not white nationalist

1053
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,023
With street gang style violence perpetrated by

1054
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,303
Real lights National

1055
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,399
Alex would do the same thing having Kessler on his show to try and get him

1056
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,751
To confess that the whole set-up was actually a Democrat

1057
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
It didn't work

1058
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,871
The Kessler wasn't on the up-and-up with

1059
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
The Patriot movement

1060
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,479
Another brand of the Charlottesville tragedy a globalist fault

1061
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:21,855
The appropriate response to a situation like the one in Charlottesville is deep reflection and empathy

1062
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
Unfortunately for people like Alex and Kevin

1063
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,255
And deep reflection leads people to realize that they are the

1064
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
The problem so that.

1065
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,863
Shot

1066
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,655
Did any

1067
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,703
Left-wing media say that it

1068
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
It was a false flag

1069
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Perpetrated by

1070
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,103
Didn't you see Rachel Maddow going out and screaming about the

1071
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,431
It was awful

1072
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,527
Did they interview that guy and say that he was actually a plant by the Republican

1073
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:55,391
Interview I believe like the guy who committed the offence

1074
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,183
His neighbor

1075
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,071
And he said you know you

1076
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,495
That sort of sex version of it

1077
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,287
No

1078
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
They didn't end up talking

1079
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
The shooter

1080
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Ballpark

1081
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
I am done being like

1082
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
You're really working

1083
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,551
Koch brothers trying to make liberals look bad

1084
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:29,183
Anyway it's all it is interesting to me that I started to realize

1085
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,047
But the Volkswagen accusation really only comes out

1086
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
Being like 911

1087
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Text Jessica business

1088
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
These days these days it comes out so much when it's like okay this

1089
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
Can't be part of what people think about

1090
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,527
Therefore is a false flag

1091
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
Because if they believe this about us

1092
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,391
We can't continue to operate the way we have

1093
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,975
We will not be allowed to or will be so obvious

1094
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Monsters

1095
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,791
That we have to deny the real

1096
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,119
They reveal themselves

1097
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
To be obvious

1098
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Monsters

1099
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
No Doubt

1100
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
No Doubt

1101
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,287
About Tuesday's episode

1102
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,871
We heard Alex saying that he is

1103
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
Gesture George Soros

1104
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,223
The Grim Reaper come to his door

1105
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,015
Death

1106
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Which was

1107
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:35,743
I'm starting when I woke up in the morning a little bit

1108
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,047
I've been looking online.

1109
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,095
He also named Lord Rothschild

1110
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,703
Venus Fly under the radar

1111
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,543
Because that would be like oh my God

1112
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
Probably claiming that he was right about that too

1113
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:58,783
No I am death I am death

1114
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:05,183
Evan Felker

1115
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,487
It was

1116
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:13,119
It was relishing it too much in a way that would I think

1117
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
I think he would have

1118
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,471
Beetle that it would take away from his

1119
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,055
Credibility maybe I don't know

1120
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,335
This is crazy.

1121
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
Are we hanging on to that clip baby

1122
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
You think that

1123
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,087
That one might be there for a while

1124
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,391
On this episode

1125
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Wednesday episode

1126
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,487
And now he's actually talking about the situation

1127
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,095
Hitman he's still not being like a cool about to these people

1128

Yorkillon infowars.com

1129
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
She's worse than that

1130
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,359
POTUS fascist dictator

1131
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:05,855
Was that the headliner with the editorializing

1132
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:10,207
A pipe bomb shows up at George Soros the Kingpin

1133
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,279
Last night

1134
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
The same headline

1135
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Holocaust Survivor

1136
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
He survived the Nazi

1137
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
The poor thing

1138
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
Now he's facing pipe bombs

1139
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,335
He worked for the Nazis and said it was the best

1140
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Timeless life

1141
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
Nachos

1142
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,527
I can't imagine

1143
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,087
This level of being a shity

1144
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,415
I get Alex needing to Kant

1145
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:46,047
Saved Soros is a Nazi collaborator by taking that 60 minutes and other interviews that he's done

1146
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
Completely wildly out of context

1147
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:54,751
Like that

1148
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
You got to do these things

1149
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,359
Demonizing your philanthropist anime

1150
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,151
Business business

1151
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:01,919
Good strategy

1152
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,527
I understand you got to say these sorts of things are false Flags is

1153
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,551
Preemptive

1154
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Kontrolfreek

1155
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,671
But I can't understand the level of

1156
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Combine the two

1157
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Like the day after

1158
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:19,071
Because I'm some level Alex f****** knows this isn't a false flag

1159
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:24,959
Well you know damn well these people's lives word at very least threat

1160
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,031
You know whether or not the song

1161
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
A terrorist

1162
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
You know I don't know if you've ever had your life

1163
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Have you ever had someone say they were going to kill you

1164
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,015
I have as well

1165
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,551
Incredible

1166
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
We're just like I'd like to f*** yourself

1167
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,791
That's

1168
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,703
But when I worked at a movie theater was a little bit younger it's some guy came in night

1169
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,751
Kick him out cuz he was acting up like crazy

1170
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,543
He said he was going to come back and kill me

1171
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,847
And I knew he wasn't going

1172
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:06,687
Unbelievable level

1173
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,991
I had I like I was like I have to

1174
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,783
I can't stay and do the rest of my shift

1175
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,599
Pretty unlikely

1176
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,903
And then I was like a peeking out my windows

1177
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
Real number on me

1178
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Agreed to that one

1179
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
That was when I was like 6

1180
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,047
17 years old

1181
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
And these are adults

1182
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
Federer

1183
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:30,495
Then I was at the time shows up where you are

1184
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Not going to not

1185
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,567
Levi impression on you

1186
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,407
So when Alex gets on air

1187
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
Sores look like

1188
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,295
Sweet little baby he's are not there yet collaborator

1189
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
It good day

1190
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
It

1191
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
It's inhuman

1192
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,159
It's

1193
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,463
I'm feeling levels of tallus Cruelty

1194
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
That

1195
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
It's pretty pretty spry

1196
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
I mean it's not but it's

1197
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
It it feels

1198
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,375
Real

1199
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
Nasty

1200
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
And I would

1201
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Broke so I was hooked

1202
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,223
Insidesherpa

1203
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
One night I

1204
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Got my ass

1205
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
To the tune of like

1206
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,367
102 huh

1207
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
Said I was always

1208
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,559
You never bring your own puke

1209
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,143
Okay

1210
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,191
So this dude I was like

1211
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
I don't have this much money on me

1212
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
I got to go to my

1213
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,103
And he's like okay man that's fine but leave

1214
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
You keep here

1215
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
So I skipped out on

1216
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
Because of course

1217
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
Brightridge

1218
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,039
Okay

1219
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,855
Dishonorable

1220
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,439
Brokeback

1221
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,255
So then like

1222
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,047
Maybe two years later

1223
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,887
I wound up going back to the same place

1224
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,935
The city where I was doing

1225
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Ever forever

1226
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,007
And I was just walking by this

1227
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
Pool table area

1228
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,871
And this dude f****** was like

1229
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
Cuz I recognize him

1230
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,551
Immediately

1231
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,415
Wait did you

1232
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:25,951
I think I

1233
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
No you

1234
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,535
I was like now you can

1235
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,095
And he's like can I see your ID

1236
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
And then he went

1237
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Van life

1238
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
F****** kill you

1239
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
When you leave this

1240
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,919
Sneaking out the back and telling one of the managers as like that guy

1241
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
Immediately

1242
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,647
The Ruff Life

1243
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,559
I was living like Tom Cruise in the color

1244
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
It's never not a good fit

1245
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,215
Never appreciate

1246
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
I know that Soros doesn't listen to

1247
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,383
But the idea of being this cruel

1248
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
To somebody who is just

1249
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Received a bomb

1250
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
I find it

1251
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,271
I find it

1252
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,599
Deplorable

1253
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
Quarterback

1254
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:40,191
Jeremiah

1255
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,239
LOL

1256
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
Bombs are there

1257
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
They're such

1258
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Victim

1259
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
There are hundreds of Chase

1260
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
Declassified false flag

1261
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,087
It's the oldest trick in the book

1262
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
TV shows like

1263
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
The TV show

1264
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,071
The oldest tricks in the book

1265
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,471
The issue that I have is yet

1266
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
There are false flags that have happened

1267
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
Saying that

1268
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,663
Doesn't prove that any individual thing is one

1269
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
All of them

1270
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
Cuz

1271
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
Does exist

1272
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,831
Doesn't mean all things are at

1273
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
Right that is

1274
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,391
Portable sink

1275
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,463
And he doesn't go much further than that in terms of trying to

1276
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,583
His arguments are essentially false flags do exist at the oldest trick in the book

1277
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,399
Therefore this is a false flag

1278
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,495
I saw it coming this based on all of these articles

1279
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
That I wrote about this with a really just preemptive

1280
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:53,407
Control cuz I know that someone's going to dragon attack him eventually and I don't want the Heat

1281
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,967
That's all he's got that's all the other

1282
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
It's

1283
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,295
Super thin

1284
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,879
Little bit about bombing

1285
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,439
Because there's another talking point that Alex Jones

1286
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,767
Doesn't bring off but I've seen posted a lot by

1287
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
S*******

1288
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
Twitter

1289
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,399
About like of course it's fake and none of them went off

1290
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
Of course

1291
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,007
Obviously if there was a bombing

1292
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:25,407
I need to address this because whether or not Alex brings it up and what we're covering I'm sure he'll bring it up eventually

1293
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,455
Hot fire with the

1294
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
The Twitter

1295
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,015
This needs to be addressed

1296
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:34,879
There are few super important points that you need to know about making bombs

1297
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
1 super easy

1298
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,231
They're very very regularly don't work

1299
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
It's very

1300
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:44,351
The process

1301
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
Along with factors

1302
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,471
Completely outside of the perpetrators control that they're nearly impossible to pull off

1303
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,847
Since the 1970s there are virtually no left-wing bombings in the United

1304
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
Well it's again

1305
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,271
70

1306
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
It just died

1307
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,695
Specifically is not been the behavior of the left

1308
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
Again if you exclude

1309
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Environmental terrorism

1310
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
And animal rights

1311
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Which I don't believe or necessarily

1312
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
Appropriate to fit under it

1313
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
The umbrella of

1314
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
Left-wing terrorism as Alex would like

1315
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
I think that would be disingenuous

1316
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Healthcare

1317
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,735
Right

1318
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,271
Listen to an issue that nobody is talking

1319
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
That would be the equivalent of terrorism

1320
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
For Alex's lightweight error

1321
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,463
You can find plenty of list of bombings and terrorist Acts

1322
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,815
Some people who made their bombs wrong

1323
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,095
So they didn't end up.

1324
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,935
It speaks actually goes off

1325
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
When someone plans

1326
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
The bomb people

1327
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,079
One of the very few large-scale bombings that were successful was the Boston bombing

1328
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:02,687
Another was the string of bombings in New York and New Jersey between September 17th and 9th

1329
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
26

1330
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Steam which left 35

1331
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:10,879
The perpetrator said previously been arrested for stabbing his brother in the leg

1332
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:15,487
After quote and another brother attempted to stop him from assaulting their mother and sister

1333
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Left-wing terrorist

1334
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,375
He spent a few months in jail and later became radicalized by online Jihadi material

1335
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,703
Which is been inspirational is planning

1336
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,263
Isaiah

1337
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
Some sort of violence against women

1338
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
And online radicalization

1339
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
Then we have the Austin situation

1340
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,223
When was terrorized Austin for 19 days

1341
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:44,671
Is done by a twenty-three-year-old man whose motivations are still not totally clear but absolutely not

1342
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
It wasn't

1343
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
Just motivated at all

1344
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,279
And that was another one that Alex had

1345
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,583
Respond and go back in

1346
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Those episode

1347
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
On the list of 9/11

1348
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
You'll find

1349
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,007
You that are bombings of mosques and specifically targeting Muslim

1350
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:03,871
One of them was a man in Spokane Luther King Day parade

1351
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
What are the Target

1352
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:09,759
Mexican consulate one of them was a bizarre omage to Fight Club

1353
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
0 of them

1354
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
I'm having carried out by left

1355
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,135
The game with the exception of environmental extremist

1356
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
An animal rights

1357
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:22,303
Almost all modern bombing behavior is attributable to Isis related terrorism and far-right terrorism

1358
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Is just out the facts breakdown

1359
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
But I think there's a more important thing that you

1360
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:30,239
Overwhelming majority of bombing do not go as a bomber plant

1361
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,287
It's incredibly hard to make bomb

1362
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,127
Then it's even more difficult to deliver them where you want them to be

1363
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:39,711
And make them detonate when you walk without someone finding them first

1364
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:45,599
Exact this is why you see so many failed bomb plot through history and why we can so clearly remember the ones that

1365
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:50,207
Completion cuz they're the exception to the rule and they're deeply emotionally scarring to ever

1366
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,279
Hard to build a bomb

1367
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:57,631
It's like not the way we do mass killings in America

1368
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
You don't need to get in

1369
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,543
Today in Estero

1370
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,359
But yeah man it's it's one of those things

1371
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,943
These things went off is

1372
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,015
Foolish as an argument as in the reality of it

1373
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,575
The number these people have Secret Service detail

1374
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,207
Immediately

1375
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
He has people

1376
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
Working there and are going to find these things

1377
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
And even though the ones that were left

1378
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,375
People's offices

1379
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
Security guard

1380
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519
Leave a bomb somewhere

1381
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
Do you want it to explode

1382
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
It's so hard for me

1383
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
How to find

1384
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,175
You get the timing right so it hurts

1385
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,039
The person that you were very difficult meaning

1386
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
More not that

1387
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
One of the bombs went off

1388
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,719
Yeah it's surprising more that not like one of the bombs went off

1389
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
And just killed some

1390
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
None of the people who

1391
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
You got bombs wherever

1392
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Alien day

1393
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,423
It was it's the people who work for

1394
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,239
Which furthers your argument that it's more about a mess

1395
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Subs and everything else

1396
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
We should know

1397
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,335
That's out of media

1398
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,127
Alex Jones preemptive

1399
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
In order to do that

1400
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,687
To blame him

1401
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
Him and make him the pass

1402
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
He knows that

1403
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,503
Because

1404
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
One of the anchors

1405
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
What's the NM

1406
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Who is not name

1407
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
Okay

1408
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
Alex Jones

1409
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,655
I'm really scared we should kill us with bombs

1410
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,447
Dimension

1411
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,847
I know I know it's terrible. We're not going to Banning

1412
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,295
Information

1413
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,647
You know when they're on every channel saying you're

1414
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:03,839
It's something that's about to happen

1415
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,519
You say they do all the time

1416
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,335
Michelle's with bombs and guns

1417
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:23,295
I think he realized envelope or something

1418
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Bryson

1419
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:30,463
That their pricing is coming

1420
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
Send it

1421
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:35,839
I don't particularly care to parse through Lester Holt to take on Alex Jones's battlerite

1422
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
Ashley was more on Alex's side about it and the context of it wasn't about an offensive sort of thing

1423
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:49,407
That was sort of emails from listeners informant

1424
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,687
Connotation

1425
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,831
We may not understand the whole context as a non gun non-military serving

1426
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,391
I don't know I can't speak to that

1427
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,999
But I don't want to get mixed up too much

1428
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:09,887
Not going to listen to others

1429
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
Listen to their perspective

1430
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:16,287
I don't I don't I don't really have a take on Lester Holt's comments

1431
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:22,431
Right but what I can tell you is that Lester Holt's discussion of Alex Jones of comments came after a number thing

1432
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:26,015
One of them was out getting on Aaron starting

1433
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:29,087
We're going to pay people to go on live TV

1434
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
Angelle CNN is Isis

1435
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,719
It was a formal contest that Alex launch promising thousands of dollars to be

1436
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,791
Quetta news networks with a terrorist organization

1437
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:46,495
A little bit after that griesmer was arrested

1438
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
January 9th and 10th

1439
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:51,359
In which you made terrorist threats and talk s*** about the Jews and black people

1440
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:57,503
In one call you said quote I'm coming to Gunn you all down I'm on my way right now to Gunn the f****** CNN cast down

1441
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
I'm coming to kill you

1442
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,623
He referred to them as fake news and dropped a couple n words for good measure

1443
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:07,231
The president of this country previously called the fake news media the enemy of the people

1444
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
He frequently attacked again and it rallies press

1445
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
Prison on Twitter

1446
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,167
It's no surprise that Lester Holt would take something appeared to be threats seriously

1447
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
That's something that's happened

1448
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Quite a bit to him

1449
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
Recently

1450
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:23,615
Refusing to accept that sort of context just saying like

1451
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,687
Nowhere

1452
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
Get your battle rifles ready

1453
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
ATMs

1454
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,111
The weakest critique we can always have four houses

1455
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,391
Being a little unfair

1456
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:42,047
But it's a little unfair

1457
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,607
Contact the things that

1458
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Okay before that

1459
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
Because they make your argument look like s***

1460
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,239
You could describe it as media script

1461
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
Scrip

1462
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
What's that

1463
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,847
Right-wing media has written

1464
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,919
They've written this whole they've created this

1465
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Whole situation

1466
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
This is

1467
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,855
To be a result scripting in that sense I think what you're talkin

1468
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
About is inadvertent

1469
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,535
Consequences it's not like at the end of it they know exactly what's going to happen

1470
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,583
It's more like this

1471
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,607
Created a

1472
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Sandbox

1473
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,167
All of these

1474
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,727
And the only logic

1475
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Cold

1476
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
The sandbox

1477
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Is

1478
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:28,383
So it is next with Alex brags about how insightful

1479
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:33,503
We have to consider

1480
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,551
But that lives in the atmosphere

1481
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,855
Literally wrong about almost every

1482
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,463
How you know when a new Coca-Cola flavors come out

1483
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,023
Cuz you see Billboards everywhere

1484
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:58,847
Ribbons

1485
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:06,015
Play Alex Jones said blow up and shoot the media

1486
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,295
Call the media

1487
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,591
You are great

1488
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
Because you see this as a giant

1489
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,455
As opposed to seeing the trends

1490
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,015
That have been pushed forward by your side

1491
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Worst part

1492
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:42,879
Is

1493
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Essentially saying

1494
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
It's okay

1495
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:53,119
Oh no that's another thing that I was going to get into is that like what we're seeing is a normalization of bombing

1496
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
We are seeing

1497
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
Literally

1498
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,447
In front of our eyes

1499
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:59,263
Of domestic Terror

1500
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
That is

1501
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
So crazy

1502
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,663
How evil is it for you to watch

1503
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,199
People get

1504
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,015
I didn't say

1505
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
It's a false flag that they're purple

1506
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,391
And that makes them

1507
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:28,447
But let's imagine a scenario where I know that we're not that important so it doesn't really matter

1508
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,871
That's how I would

1509
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
Sure

1510
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,247
I get killed in a bombing

1511
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
Alex Jones

1512
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,135
Knows that I demonize him all the

1513
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,927
All the time from this show

1514
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
So

1515
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743
It would be an easy argument to make

1516
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
That like

1517
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Something like that

1518
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
Well I mean

1519
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:14,015
The only difference between that and what we're seeing now is I'm discussing a bomb

1520
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Did go off

1521
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,087
Yeah if any of these let's say

1522
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,159
Didn't go off

1523
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,743
One of them getting killed Debbie Wasserman Schultz

1524
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
Could he still make this argument

1525
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,071
You Betty

1526
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,679
You f****** and if you would do it with one of them going off

1527
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
He do it with all of

1528
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Them going off

1529
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,775
This is

1530
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,567
Like I know that we

1531
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:43,967
I've talked about 42 Pierce on this show all he does is normalize and

1532
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
Violence

1533
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
And pretended White

1534
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,623
Violence and terrorism don't exist

1535
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,671
But didn't level that he's going to

1536
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
To hear

1537
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,975
He's profoundly Danger

1538
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,279
And what it implies for the future

1539
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Is

1540
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
So f***** up

1541
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,119
It's so scary

1542
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,423
To hammer this point home

1543
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,239
Years ago when we started this podcast

1544
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,567
Right

1545
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
Every

1546
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,479
Single f****** right-wing media Outlet is saying it's a false flag like Alex's

1547
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,087
Better by normalizing bombing the same way Alex.

1548
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,159
We thought we were out on the middle of the

1549
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:29,023
We were we were

1550
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,607
Real world

1551
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,887
This is our fault

1552
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,215
No it literally

1553
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:42,591
Maybe we normalize this language based on our audience we literally can't wait

1554
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,431
Listen to our shirts

1555
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:54,623
I don't know about that years ago different landscape for Alex was being as like

1556
01:19:55,135 --> 01:20:00,255
You was out there and now he's right in line

1557
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:04,863
Right that's absolutely right it's not it's not that Alex has changed

1558
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,423
The GOP although

1559
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,311
He's become much more of a quote basic b**** of the right it's that the right has come

1560
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
To him

1561
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:18,432
In terms of the craziness

1562
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,456
I don't think anyone

1563
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:24,576
Leaving us could have predicted that never replies is like

1564
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,904
Literally the most dangerous mentality that is possible

1565
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,184
Because

1566
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
Anytime

1567
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Now

1568
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
That any attack happens on people on the left

1569
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,840
This is going to be the narrative

1570
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,912
That all of these heads on Twitter and

1571
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,216
Ann Coulter Sean Hannity

1572
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,240
Lou Dobbs

1573
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,312
That is going to be something that's going to be a card they can play

1574
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
And when

1575
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Now that they played

1576
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
That card

1577
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
Seems like they can

1578
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,272
Go back

1579
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,600
They've already called it a false flag

1580
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:02,720
Bright

1581
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,024
What they're doing and that person will have to be a pastor

1582
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
We'll have to be innocent

1583
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:18,080
Going backward

1584
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
Progression

1585
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
From

1586
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,528
Conspiracy theory stuff it propped up as Trump

1587
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,576
Became much more normal

1588
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,880
And then as it got closer to the election

1589
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
More normal

1590
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Went crazy

1591
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
But

1592
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
Smaller level

1593
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
You have

1594
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
The normalization

1595
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,632
The right-wing media

1596
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,912
Especially Fox News

1597
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,472
FIFA

1598
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
And

1599
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
The proud boys

1600
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,800
Are the same thing

1601
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:54,176
We're sort of organized

1602
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
Group

1603
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:00,064
Rite Aid and all they want to do is go and beat up Chris

1604
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:05,184
Yeah right perspective as opposed to it being a loose-knit

1605
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
Group of unorganized

1606
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,584
Groups of people who go in

1607
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
Encounter demonstrate

1608
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,960
Fascist

1609
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,752
Fashion and are willing to fight with

1610
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,056
With them as opposed to a lot of

1611
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
Straight against

1612
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:29,248
So you have that on that side and then with the proud boys you have a s******* cult leader

1613
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:33,088
Play Gavin McInnes who screams all the time but how he wants

1614
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,928
And thinks that Society is too weak we should kick the s*** out of each other

1615
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:43,328
And has a group with a regimented structure where the fourth level of it is you have to

1616
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,144
To beat somebody up or get arrested for the cause

1617
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,936
Heat incentivizes

1618
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,216
Business idea of

1619
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:53,056
Going and that's the fourth level of The Proud boys

1620
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,592
What's 1/4 / 4

1621
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,872
That's real

1622
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,688
You have to get into a fight

1623
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
I guess not

1624
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,272
Can you not do that no because you

1625
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:06,112
Pretend

1626
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:12,256
But of course

1627
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
As opposed to

1628
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
There is nothing like that on the left

1629
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:19,424
Did you go pick a fight with you

1630
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,032
It's crazy because that language of

1631
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,312
Equivalent of

1632
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
Cowboys

1633
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
And they're funded by Joy

1634
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
George Soros

1635
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,552
That sort of language about

1636
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,600
What did the

1637
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,136
Broader picture

1638
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:43,744
Is the first step that leads up to

1639
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Nick terrorism

1640
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
And you know

1641
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,400
Charlottesville President coming out saying good people on both sides

1642
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:54,496
It muddies the water of what we're at

1643
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
We talkin about

1644
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,080
And that even goes back to Alex's

1645
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
Yep because he never defines what Nazi

1646
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
Collaborator mean

1647
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
Which makes it

1648
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Stole

1649
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
Because if he said

1650
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,392
He's a Nazi collaborator and by that I mean

1651
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:17,536
When he was a very young boy he was a part of the Jewish Council which was an organization

1652
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:24,192
They should also tell you that back then they didn't let Jewish kids go to school until they had to become a part of this

1653
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,800
Deliver messages to

1654
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:32,384
Is around town and then I was a

1655
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,688
They give this message

1656
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
They would end up getting taken away

1657
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,576
So young George Soros told his dad about these message

1658
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
He was told to deliver

1659
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
And his dad

1660
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
Deliver those messages

1661
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,720
That you tell everybody that you give that message to

1662
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:48,512
If you show up to that meeting

1663
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,792
They are never going to

1664
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,584
Comeback you warned them

1665
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,400
That this is something that there is not what it appears to be

1666
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
You deliver those messages

1667
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:02,080
And I want people as his father did as well

1668
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,872
Save the number of people from

1669
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
The Holocaust

1670
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,176
From being taken away.

1671
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,480
Dashi as boy

1672
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
After he made that run

1673
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
Like I am not doing this anymore

1674
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,832
So he disappeared

1675
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
Stop the stop going

1676
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,160
Into the Jewish Council

1677
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Meeting

1678
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,976
That he was made to do because Jews

1679
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
Going to live to go to school

1680
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,584
Paul Revere

1681
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,216
Was called a British collaborator

1682
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,520
Right tells you that the

1683
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,568
Evil is coming

1684
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,848
That person is

1685
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,640
We collaborated with that

1686
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
How could they

1687
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:41,248
But if you wanted conversation

1688
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,576
About what does collaborator mean

1689
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,368
Then that would be easy we

1690
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,184
All the power out of his deck

1691
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,488
Akita Nazi collaborator and buy that I have

1692
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,536
Brought it definition

1693
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,168
The verdict

1694
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,216
The process that he was

1695
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
Supposed to be

1696
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,032
Looks like there's all this stuff

1697
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
The essence of

1698
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
What's going wrong

1699
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,128
Thursday

1700
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
Deterioration of

1701
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Definition

1702
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,736
There's a deterioration of

1703
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
Contact

1704
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
All of this stuff

1705
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,600
Just serving

1706
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
I don't even know

1707
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,720
Defense people playing defense

1708
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,816
Does it mean if you look at

1709
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:33,216
Popular who wouldn't be in any way if they weren't staying the shittiest thing

1710
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,288
So for them there has to be some sort of

1711
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,616
The financial incentive 100,000

1712
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,176
Don't have a gig otherwise

1713
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
Anita's Ally

1714
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,784
With what he said

1715
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
Even if

1716
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Was the

1717
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
False flag

1718
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
And he's arguing

1719
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
Is that

1720
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
CNN

1721
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Trying to pay

1722
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,912
Poor little baby

1723
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
Which you put those two

1724
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,984
Two things together and what

1725
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
Play saying is

1726
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
Why would you care if he got back

1727
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:15,456
That's definitely a piece of it

1728
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:20,832
He's a book He's a Nazi collaborator why are you even trying to stop him from getting

1729
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,672
Why aren't there is a piece of that

1730
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,048
Maybe a couple more clips

1731
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Get to it which way

1732
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
We're not legally allowed

1733
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,680
Trump outlawed

1734
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
Magical mirrors

1735
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,520
I am

1736
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:45,664
A couple more Clips before we do that I want to talk a little bit about how

1737
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
For today

1738
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
There were a number of like I didn't want to talk about present-day of core

1739
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368
I don't want to put people through that

1740
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
And I think that a lot of

1741
01:27:59,232 --> 01:27:59,744
We've been having this

1742
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
It's fairly basic

1743
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,656
But it doesn't really charmie all that much

1744
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,704
To reiterate

1745
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,264
This is why

1746
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
He talks about false flags all the time

1747
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,872
Yeah this is this is his way of

1748
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
Like you

1749
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,688
Very eloquently put

1750
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
Admitting without admitting

1751
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,296
He knows something is really bad

1752
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
Tunak

1753
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,112
Papillon look for it

1754
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,928
So I started to Rack my brain to think about like

1755
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,720
What are other time

1756
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,512
That we could draw analogs

1757
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,840
Hey one of them was the Boston bombing and listening to that

1758
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,632
That was just a waste of an hour

1759
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,960
Unless we did a dedicated episode about that

1760
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,008
If so

1761
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,872
It's it's hard for me to experience the things were experiencing together in the country right now

1762
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,920
Without thinking back to April 2010

1763
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:56,064
That month was a month it was full of right-wing Insanity episode I wanted to go

1764
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,112
See what Alex was saying about a couple incident

1765
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:02,208
Imagine my surprise when I didn't find him saying anything

1766
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,280
And mostly just talk about how Oklahoma City was a false flag.

1767
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Cuz April is the universe

1768
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,168
There's some things I did learn

1769
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,472
April 2010

1770
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
Confirm for you that Alex was protein

1771
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,592
So you does end up getting on board

1772
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,872
Buy a April

1773
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
2010

1774
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:25,760
You were very closely aligned with the rising tide in the Tea Party

1775
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,832
April 2010 Wet'n'Wild

1776
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:34,976
On April 15th 2010 president of the Cleveland chapter of The Oath Keepers Matthew Fairfield was arrested

1777
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,768
And indicted on 28 explosive

1778
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,304
Surcharges 25-count

1779
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,840
Receiving stolen property

1780
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,144
And one count of possessing criminal tools

1781
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,728
When the police searched his home they found a literal Napalm bomb

1782
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,288
But he'd constructed as well as child pronography

1783
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,688
From an article on cleveland.com

1784
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,456
Tough

1785
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,480
Two-hander

1786
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,064
ATF agent said

1787
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,184
The discovery of the homemade bomb was particularly troubling because Napalm is designed to Target

1788
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:06,720
Of course

1789
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,280
This wasn't any kind of isolated

1790
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,096
Fairfield was previously convicted in sentence

1791
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,912
Two years probation in February for carrying concealed weapon

1792
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:19,008
He's dropped a loaded gun to his ankle while attending an event at a country fairgrounds

1793
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:23,104
The Napalm bomb is obviously a huge red flag but this guy also had

1794
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,896
A bit of an Armory going

1795
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:31,296
Motorcar detonators to m4 assault rifles a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun

1796
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,344
A 22 caliber bolt-action rifle

1797
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Semi automatic

1798
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
I can't dance from

1799
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,928
He was hunting

1800
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,584
This got a guy who was arrested on 28 explosive charges among other bomb

1801
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,864
Generally speaking

1802
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,168
You do not build bombs for recreation

1803
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,776
Just sitting around is a bomb that is not serve

1804
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,312
It's only purpose

1805
01:30:54,080 --> 01:31:00,224
So I went back and listen to episodes around the time of fairfield's arrest there was an article that came

1806
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
A couple days after his arrest

1807
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,344
So I checked that seems like maybe Alex missed the news

1808
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:10,976
Expected Alex to say it was a false flag and there was attempted besmirch the good name of The Oath Keepers

1809
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,536
What I found instead with him not bringing up the

1810
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
Story at all radio silence

1811
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,864
Radio silence

1812
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:21,984
And what's difficult for me about that is I had to listen to all of that and I can't prove to you and Nick

1813
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,056
I can't sit here and play a clip of him not saying that

1814
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,848
Right go ahead

1815
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,408
Waste 4 hours drive

1816
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,248
Unsatisfying

1817
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:37,344
So here was the president The Oath Keepers chapter in the city of

1818
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,904
Population over 2 billion people

1819
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,928
Being arrested

1820
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,720
For building a bomb that was meant to

1821
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
Target people

1822
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,768
With napalm

1823
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,560
And Alex doesn't talk about it

1824
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
At all

1825
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,608
Don't come up

1826
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Emily's

1827
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
That sucks

1828
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,192
The kind of wish that Alex

1829
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,008
Had claimed it was a false flag made meant to make the o.c.

1830
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:58,336
People's look bad cuz then I could have told you all about Derek Hough

1831
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,736
The Tennessee okiboru got arrested on April 30th 2010

1832
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,504
Courthouse

1833
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,576
Where he would assert control them put everyone under citizen

1834
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:11,392
I could tell you about how get 300

1835
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,696
An AK-47 as well as a handgun

1836
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
Because quote

1837
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,744
I've got my 45

1838
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
Because ain't no government official going to go peacefully

1839
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:24,960
I could tell you about how only went to take over that because they were hosting a trial for a sovereign citizen weirdo named Walter

1840
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,240
Fitzpatrick

1841
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:32,640
Who's being tried for trying to make a citizen's arrest on the foreman of a grand jury charged with him

1842
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,248
I can tell you that help was under surveillance

1843
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:43,648
The entire time he was traveling from Madisonville because

1844
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:45,696
Buddy we're going to take over Madisonville

1845
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,024
I can tell you about how the city of

1846
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,888
I could tell you about how the city of Madisonville surreptitiously rescheduled.

1847
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,288
I told Courthouse employees to stay home that day so hopefully his militia buddies ended up showing up to an empty Courthouse under

1848
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
And have you got four years

1849
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:07,712
Four years in prison and ended up getting hurt

1850
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Get him for that one is like

1851
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
You know I'm saying

1852
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,136
Man

1853

Really super small town of like hey if you're trying to

1854
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,096
Take over a town where y'all at

1855
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:29,216
Should be higher

1856
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:33,568
Town meeting

1857
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,592
Some stuff down

1858
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,128
I could tell you about

1859
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,176
Countless other very serious

1860
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:41,248
He like that last one

1861
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,808
Cinnamon plant are carried out by right-wing groups

1862
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
Country

1863
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,624
Just because something doesn't go off

1864
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,672
Has planned doesn't mean that it's fake

1865
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,696
Which is an important

1866
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
Distinction

1867
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
And secondarily

1868
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,024
There is a ton

1869
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,072
Oathkeeper related

1870
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
Right wing

1871
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Violin

1872
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
Damn terrorism

1873
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,728
Are you otherwise

1874
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,264
Doesn't even make the effort

1875
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
To say it's a false flag

1876
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,944
Earlier when you bringing up this idea of like what does he call the false flag and you were suggesting all the things

1877
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,224
You can paint on the right or

1878
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:12,992
False flag

1879
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,784
Albany just doesn't talk about it

1880
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,624
And this one like this dude this initial dude here

1881
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,208
This guy Matthew Fairfield

1882
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,768
Is there a one-to-one parallel

1883
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,608
Who the guy was making multiple bonds one of them a Napalm bomb

1884
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
I mean

1885
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,704
This is the sort of things

1886
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
You see

1887
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,360
I don't remember it

1888
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Seniors

1889
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:46,528
I get it that should be so much longer I get it mixed up cuz there was another story about another guy from

1890
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,088
May or may not have had a

1891
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,880
Stolen

1892
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,160
A grenade launcher

1893
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:52,928
But he claimed

1894
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,336
What happened

1895
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:13,152
What island in Hawaii

1896
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,944
Right

1897
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,736
Yeah they going to the leper colony

1898
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,528
No no no

1899
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
Underwater now

1900
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
Can we put them on

1901
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
Underwater now

1902
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,672
I feel like housing

1903
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,768
Difficult Island it can't be an island again

1904
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,376
That's good

1905
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,424
Molokai

1906
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,728
Cinnamon that's a leper colony Island

1907
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:44,640
Other people how to make f****** when I lived in Hawaii

1908
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
2 island

1909
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,968
Molokai

1910
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
Can't go cuz

1911
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,504
Used to be a leprechaun

1912
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,600
Is entirely owned by

1913
01:35:54,368 --> 01:36:00,512
What is all fruit

1914
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,448
I don't know if that's okay maybe we should have islands that are just fruit I don't know I don't know if it's 104

1915
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,544
The understanding was growing out there's like

1916
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,080
You can't go there

1917
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,360
Don't buy.

1918
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
Pennywise

1919
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,968
That is to say

1920
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,784
I kind of wanted to talk about that stuff even though it's not

1921
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,344
It's relevant to this episode but not 100

1922
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
Alex.

1923
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
Talk about

1924
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
Is that

1925
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,488
Our real-world damaging

1926
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
He does predictively

1927
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
Repair

1928
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,376
People

1929
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,144
4

1930
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,936
These narratives that are going to be

1931
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,984
Or real-world events

1932
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,008
Latinos are coming

1933
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
They can't avoid

1934
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,848
He can avoid that thing with the oathkeeper

1935
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
This one

1936
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,176
He knows that the guy that

1937
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,712
He is the biggest fan of

1938
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,736
Is

1939
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
Two-way that jeopardizes

1940
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Safety

1941
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
Journalist

1942
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
In order to

1943
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,624
Protect himself

1944
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
She has to create

1945
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:02,976
So

1946
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:06,304
The issue is that it's not just

1947
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,608
It's not just about saying

1948
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
These bombs are

1949
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
There's something much deep

1950
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,192
Cheaper at hand here

1951
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,728
And this is why I ever wanted

1952
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Very worried

1953
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,528
The shut it up and test the public

1954
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:29,856
And Obama is

1955
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,144
Rolls

1956
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,032
Osecina

1957
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:04,160
Alex's articulating exactly what you said about the idea of now

1958
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,696
If something does happen

1959
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,256
That will be what you know that doesn't matter

1960
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,816
He's saying they're going to blow up

1961
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
BNN

1962
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,608
Which

1963
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
Is that does happen

1964
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
Alex now is ready to be like

1965
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Who cares

1966
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,264
It's not real it's all fake

1967
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Who gives a s***

1968
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,568
This is a globalist

1969
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:28,736
All terrorism is on the table man

1970
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,320
I still think there is one and there really isn't

1971
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:38,720
There really isn't those nowhere else for them to go but lower than whatever you think the floor is Alex's expensive

1972
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:43,840
All of the right-wing media

1973
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:48,704
Two of his way of being which is to normalize white violence and white terrorism

1974
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,032
To the point now where we entire political party

1975
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
And their propaganda organ

1976
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,616
That are in service

1977
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
Of

1978
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,200
Man if any white guys do anything it's fake

1979
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,064
I think that the election

1980
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:04,832
What about

1981
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,696
Anxiety

1982
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,464
The midwestern

1983
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,000
Just felt like they were left

1984
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,072
It's hard to say what the motivation

1985
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
But we can certainly see the effects

1986
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Land

1987
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,984
I know I don't want to leave people feeling like

1988
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,008
Hey

1989
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
Cuz Alex

1990
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,640
No cuz I was wrong about

1991
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
I don't I don't

1992
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:33,760
I don't think anybody should take him to be

1993
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,808
Like evidence that it's going to happen

1994
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,600
But I would say

1995
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Did Alex

1996
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
If you can clearly see that

1997
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
He thinks

1998
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
S*** this is going to ask collate

1999
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,304
And he knows that be

2000
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:50,400
He knows what his fans are like that's why he runs away from them on the street

2001
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,680
That's why he's

2002
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:58,848
He doesn't want to go into the Trump rally because there's too many Trump people in there

2003
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,384
He knows that

2004
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,712
That's why he yells at a piece of s*** and calls it Beto outside

2005
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,992
Instead of actually

2006
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,016
Engaged

2007
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,064
The thing

2008
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,088
He's created

2009
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,112
Dinos

2010
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,392
He knows that there are

2011
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,184
Dangerous people on that side

2012
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:14,976
Statistics facts

2013
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,816
And there's no reason why he would

2014
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,352
You would make that prediction

2015
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,144
False flag

2016
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,728
So probably going to happen

2017
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:26,496
Control

2018
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,520
Well I don't

2019
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
I don't know

2020
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,592
Does anybody

2021
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,640
No course

2022
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
Nobody thinks that

2023
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,736
Ten bombs

2024
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,760
That don't go off

2025
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
Where it ends

2026
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,320
And especially

2027
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:45,696
Like I know that we're recording this here on Thursday evening

2028
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:49,536
Fresh thyme we can have

2029
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,840
The perspective of like

2030
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,376
No one's been caught

2031
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:56,448
But someone will eventually this case

2032
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,496
Pizza floppy

2033
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
Situation

2034
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:07,200
Criminal mastermind I'm sure there are fingerprints done investigation is going

2035
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,992
To happen it's going to

2036
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
More facts

2037
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,296
We'll come out and we'll be able to

2038
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
Disgusting more accurately

2039
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,392
But

2040
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,464
At the same time if you're the person who did it

2041
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:21,280
And you see an entire political party working

2042
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
In order to pay

2043
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,096
Presented as if

2044
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,400
You weren't doing the thing that you did

2045
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:30,752
I don't know what other message that sends bombers

2046
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,800
It sends a message of eight

2047
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
You do this

2048
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
We're going to bed

2049
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:42,528
Even if you don't get caught we're going to do our best to make sure that people think it was this shadowy cabal of

2050
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
Definitely not Jews

2051
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,880
So I mean the world that were entering

2052
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:48,672
F***** up

2053
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,440
Dangerous

2054
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
We Don't Step Up

2055
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,024
And the media doesn't step up

2056
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,048
I know

2057
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,096
Some people are doing a good job about

2058
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,400
Don't get me wrong I'm not saying everybody suck

2059
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,448
But people need to step up and

2060
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
Talk about it

2061
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,544
They're normalizing terrorism

2062
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,848
It's not a situation of

2063
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,176
Hey what's this quirky false-flag hashtag that's going around

2064
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,456
It's not that

2065
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,784
Intentionally or not

2066
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,808
The right-wing

2067
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,624
Speaking to normalize and make okay

2068
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
White Terror

2069
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
I'm saying that

2070
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,232
With no idea if

2071
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
Who's doing this is why

2072
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:26,048
We don't know anything about it

2073
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:29,888
Matters

2074
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,424
Because they're defending

2075
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,752
As Bill the person was there's that

2076
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,800
The reasons that I'm putting

2077
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,824
Into the equation is

2078
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,592
Because

2079
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
Look at the

2080
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
Imo

2081
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Past history of the

2082
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
People who are doing

2083
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,248
Who are they getting the media

2084
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,088
Like Lou Dobbs like Russia

2085
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Limbach

2086
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,184
These are people who is made careers out of justifying

2087
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,488
And minimizing

2088
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,512
The effect

2089
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
On their V

2090
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
These are the people

2091
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:01,376
I mean Tucker Carlson did fine for himself

2092
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,400
Crossfire

2093
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:05,216
But he wasn't making nearly the amount of money he is now

2094
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:05,984
Being just

2095
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,520
Lap dogs

2096
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:10,336
Is justifying white supremacy on tonight

2097
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Salt Lake

2098
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,432
I'm saying that they're doing this in an effort

2099
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:16,224
To normalize white terrorism

2100
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,504
Because of the

2101
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,784
People in the media

2102
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,576
Their behavior

2103
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,856
Beer is in line with

2104
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,208
Not necessarily that

2105
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,232
Perpetrator

2106
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
Turcotte is why

2107
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,792
I need to make that clear

2108
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,120
When I accept theirs

2109
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,144
Entire world

2110
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,936
Out there of possibilities

2111
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,704
Disperse

2112
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,752
Azar

2113
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
Imagine

2114
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,128
Like we don't get the opportunity to imagine

2115
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
Alex does

2116
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
Have a writers room

2117
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
Deeply script

2118
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,600
I imagine being in that

2119
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,624
Production

2120
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Tucker Carlson

2121
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
And there are

2122
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,768
A bunch of producers in there

2123
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,048
About what it is we

2124
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:04,864
The content

2125
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
This was there

2126
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,960
Maybe we're

2127
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:09,984
Not

2128
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
Doing this

2129
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,288
Maybe we should

2130
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,592
I mean it goes back to

2131
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,408
Like we were talking about employees at Fox News like

2132
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:23,808
I'm not saying I'm not talking they're all awful or anything like that

2133
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,832
I find

2134
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,112
Difficult to imagine

2135
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,160
People there who have

2136
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,976
Quit already it's hard for me to

2137
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,816
There are no

2138
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,120
Designer

2139
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,424
The whole thing

2140
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,960
Like there is somebody

2141
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:45,568
Tucker Carlson doesn't record a show live like Alex

2142
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:50,176
Alex

2143
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Everstaff

2144
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:55,040
And the people who wouldn't maybe been like I don't know about this

2145
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:58,624
Natural selection

2146
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
Things that we're going on

2147
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,120
Look I'm not trying to

2148
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
B2 fatalistic

2149
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,704
Go to like a freak out but like

2150
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:17,056
If we are not more careful about how we allow stories

2151
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,848
To be told how we allowed

2152
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,896
The media to behave and I'm not saying like

2153
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
On the media

2154
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,456
But like

2155
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,736
People who

2156
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,272
People riding the headline

2157
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,600
Need to be substantially

2158
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Be more careful

2159
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:33,696
They need to be more aware of what's actually going on

2160
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,560
And effect of this right-wing propaganda is

2161
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:41,120
It's incredibly difficult

2162
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,144
I do not

2163
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,448
I am not in any way jealous of their position

2164
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
I couldn't do

2165
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,824
Finger-like

2166
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,872
I could do your job or anything like that

2167
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,176
I couldn't but I also didn't go get a journalism

2168
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,760
You guys put yourself in this position

2169
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:02,624
Because you who study journalism and now he's made a career out of being journalist

2170
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
The public

2171
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,976
Trust you to know how to do journalism

2172
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,512
And we trust you

2173
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
To adapt

2174
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
The times that we're in

2175
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,840
And not falling

2176
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
To the traps

2177
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
These right-wing propaganda

2178
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,448
That will lead us all down the road to hell

2179
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,984
Where any attack

2180
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,520
On anybody on the left

2181
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,568
Because that's where we're going

2182
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
Without

2183
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,896
Where We Are

2184
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,224
But that that's where we're going

2185
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,992
We don't get the

2186
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,784
And I say we

2187
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
I don't mean to laugh

2188
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,672
Because it's easy for it to swing the other way to

2189
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
I don't think we want that

2190
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:50,240
Hopefully the one that's fair

2191
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,360
Might be deserved but

2192
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,712
I don't have anything to take this thing off this at all or anything

2193
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,248
At all

2194
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:05,344
Hopefully there won't be any more Banzai next week she'll be more fun

2195
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,880
Listen to the show

2196
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,440
Expecting optimism about the future

2197
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,208
We

2198
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
Have put

2199
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,560
Together a long track record of being very positive about

2200
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,120
The directions

2201
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Getting everybody

2202
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,656
Please erase

2203
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,424
To an opinion

2204
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:26,080
Everything is good looking on the bright side

2205
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:30,688
I am over here

2206
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:36,576
Antifreeze

2207
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,904
So I don't know it sucks but next week

2208
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,184
Hopefully I'll be better

2209
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:47,584
Anyway website.com

2210

It's really

Really good

2218
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
It's a really positive

2219

Bomber

2220
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:26,752
No that's true I'll tell you what he did though

2221
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,032
Probably

2222
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,872
