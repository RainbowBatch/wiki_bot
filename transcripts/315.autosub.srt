1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,080
Beverages and talk a little bit

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
About Alex

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,920
Jones

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
Have you ever been in

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:25,856
Corn mazes maybe I feel like I have been Central Missouri we went

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,696
Interstate fairs

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah I never had any

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,584
Experience

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
I feel like I've been in haunted houses

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
More

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
Good houses I always found up unpleasant

13
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:49,408
There was too much awareness for me that these weren't monsters they were people

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
Trying to scare me

15
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
And that made me was that

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Enjoy that

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,856
Of course I did one time go to a rave at a haunted

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
House also

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
In Columbia

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
But during that

21
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
During October time

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Was that

23
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Haunted house

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Know when this was but it was

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Not during Halloween

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,800
A bunch of people who held the RAV4 there

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,152
As much as I may be sure I wasn't apart of that

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
A lot of industrial music maybe not for

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
But it was surreal to walk around the

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Parts of the house

31
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
With the light

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Yeah

33
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
It seemed like all of you

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,584
These weird quarters were people would hide

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
But looking back on it

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,848
Or anything I don't know if it was it was just weird

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Notable it happened

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Play I definitely

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Hello.

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
How many mazes come up

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,744
Today is DJ Chicago supposed to last

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Celebration

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Was trying to walk over here not realizing

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
Well we live on

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,312
We live is the parade route

46
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
2

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Some reason

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
I don't know

49
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,440
Are they going to hold up.

50
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
It was only like a block but I had to backtrack and go all the way around it and then

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
To do this Ziggy zaggy thing to get from

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Because Broadway is Miyazaki

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
Apologize

54
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
And I know a lot better

55
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Alex Jones

56
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
And I only know what you tell me about both

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,208
That's right

58
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,632
But before I say

59
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
Episode

60
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
I got to take a little time

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
People who signed up and are supporting the show

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
We really appreciate it

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,848

I'm a policy wonk

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,280
Next of Barnes Barnes

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Paris Enoch in barn

72
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

73
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
I'm a policy wonk

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
Thank you Laura offices of Barnes Barnes

75
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Patterson acambaro

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
All I have to say

77
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,944
You donated on a little bit of an elevated level we appreciate it very much

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Is freakishly large

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Stripe.com

81
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
But instead Sports sure we'd appreciate

82
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,599
First thing I need to say is a little bit of a correction information

83
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
Slightly

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
In

85
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Complete information on her last episode

86
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
And that I was incorrect

87
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
About

88
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
You going away led to

89
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
The development

90
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
No s*** yeah so cool I was incorrect about that

91
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Now I will say

92
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
That I was not correct

93
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,431
About my kids my contention that they are very

94
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
There are similarities

95
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Between the two

96
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,343
But I was wrong about that aspect of it

97
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,743
So I guess

98
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
It was my sin

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Your intention Jordan to do episode today here we talk about Alex Jones

100
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Credit card debate

101
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,711
Is doing live coverage of Both Worlds

102
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Cuz all the time

103
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
How far off the rails

104
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
End up really f***** up with

105
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Drunk

106
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
And yelling about us someone basically irresponsible

107
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,703
Sometimes even cries and tells us about the four ways humans can learn two things does a good thing

108
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
I sat down to get us

109
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,127
Source material and it immediately was not going to work

110
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
On the first night of the Bates Alex was not drunk

111
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
It definitely feels like someone may have given him a Stern talking-to and the show is pretty much just a boring version of his normal

112
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Show but with Owen Shroyer

113
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
And Barnes co-hosting

114
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
It's a Telethon for sure

115
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
And it's really less about the debates and more about Alex's victim status and how everyone's crying

116
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Take him down

117
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Ultimately was a huge disappointment.

118
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
4 hours worth of b******* that we don't

119
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
I need to go over

120
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
So I tuned into the Thursday show figuring Alex

121
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Cuz got to have some next day

122
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Throw out

123
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,223
I can almost taste how hard he's going to go after Beto for talking in Spanish

124
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,575
Has the show started up I could tell that what I was hearing was a pre-recorded message

125
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Message from Alex

126
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,951
It sounds like he's recording it at like 4 a.m. inside a tin can

127
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,535
It's basically just a accusing Elizabeth Warren of being on cocaine

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Okay here is a taste of that

129
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Think about

130
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Obviously

131
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:21,087
For 2 hours

132
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
Guarantee

133
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Large amounts of it

134
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,095
So it sounds like it's awful

135
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
A couple of minutes

136
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
He has Barnes host the rest of the show which is unlistenable but it does feed into your theory that Barnes

137
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
Just trying to take over

138
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
So I must just be tired

139
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,319
He was up late doing the livestream that I before so we had Barnes cover for him to get energy back

140
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
Fortnite 2

141
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
A big night

142
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Closeout clown world

143
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,071
So I turned on night to a my reaction was not unlike that of a lovecraftian protagonist

144
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
Come face-to-face with some sort of Eldritch Horror

145
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
Alex wasn't even on his own debate live stream coverage it was all

146
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
Goodnight and barn

147
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Is awful

148
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
They didn't they did play a 2-minute recording

149
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,319
Recalls the Democrats losers

150
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,951
But it sounds like it was recorded at about 4:10 a.m. in the same reported the other day

151
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Message

152
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
And then Friday shows just that's

153
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Alex is basically announced

154
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
Factor in his democratic debate coverage

155
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
On Friday it's just Barnes

156
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
David Owen Shroyer again

157
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
He doesn't even get to make fun of how Marianne Williamson. It was there he was funny

158
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
The party

159
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
That what's up

160
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,855
Alex is supposed to be deposed in the Sandy Hook lawsuit on July 1st and 2nd

161
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Or Monday and Tuesday of this

162
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
Connecticut case where Norm Patterson

163
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Doesn't charge

164
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
Given the s*** that's been happening with Alex between these horrible response to the illegal pornography that was discovered in discover

165
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
You know his very clear attempts

166
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
To threaten opposing counsel

167
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
And put a million-dollar bounty on them

168
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
I wouldn't be

169
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Surprised if Norman

170
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Alex actually prepare for this deposition

171
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
If you work all he does

172
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Kind of wants to win the case

173
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
As opposed to Barn to seems far more interested in logging a h on

174
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Iran Infowars

175
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
And making a lawsuit

176
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Milka

177
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
Milks for all the publicity they can bring

178
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
And then settling the case

179
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Because whenever Shake

180
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Get to real

181
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Yeah

182
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,639
Would get more market value out of a better outcome of the case

183
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
I don't know why we like totally wrong

184
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
I have no idea

185
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
Possible make

186
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,647
Said it wasn't a situation where nor made Alex come to Connecticut early

187
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
Which would explain his absence

188
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
As well as the shity sound quality the recording

189
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Might have been filming it in an airport

190
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Whatever the case is I have no new Alex

191
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
To cover the past

192
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Follow how Alex

193
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Two narratives

194
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Sandbox

195
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
After Sandy Hook

196
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Today we are going over February 17th

197
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
1/18

198
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Some of it's fairly interesting

199
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
And some of it is

200
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
Profoundly upsetting there will be one portion of this episode

201
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
That I'm going to give a contact

202
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Encore in

203
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
F***** up stuff

204
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
But

205
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
It's because I did not watch

206
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,751
Right

207
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
Narrative is like

208
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
You know I

209
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Me and

210
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Subreddit

211
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
The Donald we got

212
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Censored

213
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
No one could attack by I'm scrolling through my Twitter feed and it's like all

214
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Or try to avoid

215
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,839
I don't really have a hot tub

216
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Like that so it's better that we stay for a little while

217
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
I don't know we'll see what happens

218
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Butts

219
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
So

220
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
It's interesting cuz the the February 7th

221
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Where we last left off there was that Russian

222
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Getting pretty silly about

223
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
Being a little irresponsible that the end was nigh

224
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
So we're going to see how that plays out on the neck

225
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,663
Today because that last one we listen to the Friday we're jumping back on

226
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
On the 17th

227
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Pictures of Sunday

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
Before we get to today's episode

229
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
For the dogs

230
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
What did you say

231
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Where are the dogs and Alex's world coming out of his mouth

232
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,919
So the first year from the 17th

233
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Alex is responding

234
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
Some media coverage of his coverage

235
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Of the Russia

236
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Meteor

237
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
This is very

238
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Very stupid

239
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Analysis very wrong

240
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,719
About

241
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Support.com

242
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
Was it

243
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Ga-14

244
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
On Friday

245
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,271
Tear

246
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,623
Alex Jones

247
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,799
So this is a real serious trying to goes on

248
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
These two days

249
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Is Alex misrepresenting people talking about

250
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:15,295
Call Friday explicit point of how Alex need to report a dumb theories that

251
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
What are true

252
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,207
Problems

253
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
It'll come out of the Alex Jones's

254
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,143
His writers are so bad at writing

255
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
Can sometimes be difficult to tell what they're actually trying to

256
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
So in this case

257
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
I wanted to figure out what was going on what was this Atlantic article what was the Infowars archive is there a cure

258
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Leave this

259
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Temptation going on

260
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
I decided anybody

261
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
It's probably me

262
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
So I checked out this article in Atlantic

263
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Has the headline

264
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
Russian meteorite

265
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Conspiracy theories

266
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Here's what the Atlantic article says

267
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
As it relates

268
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,727
More wide-eyed theorists have suggested that the object may have been a meteor

269
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,335
May not have been a meteor at all and could have been a satellite that was shot down or some form of

270
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Kinetic bombardment weapon

271
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Russia

272
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
The conspiracy loving folks over it

273
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
1112

274
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Alright Infowars

275
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
So the beginning of that part is

276
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
The quote from an Infowars Artica

277
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,743
You know this is the part that makes it clear. Indian forwards articles

278
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
They're discussing quote more wide-eyed.

279
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,447
That's pretty much the article goes on vladamir

280
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Azuree

281
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
0 Knob ski

282
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
The meteor was a u.s. weapon

283
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Target

284
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Better breaks down hoe that's not

285
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
But at no point does the article say that Alex's advanced

286
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295
They take a quote from the article where Alex is

287
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,159
Or the Infowars article is saying that more wide-eyed serious are suggesting

288
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Doesn't matter

289
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Doesn't

290
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Suggest that

291
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
They're not advancing those.

292
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Yeah

293
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
4 yd

294
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
More

295
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Totally fine actually almost responsible

296
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
It's totally fair

297
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
So the Infowars article itself was written by Steve Watson and it pains me to say this but

298
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Stupid

299
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
This is about the best version of it you could write

300
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
The Atlantic accurately cover the Infowars article they quoted the part of the story where Steve Watson had written about the WiDi conspiracy

301
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Believing this idea which is a fair representation

302
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Text no harm

303
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
No foul

304
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,567
Not just because the Atlantic article accurately discuss Steve Watson

305
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Article

306
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
They might have been able to make a much different case

307
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,711
They took into account all of Infowars outfit

308
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
16th and Fort Worth Public

309
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Special Report titled quote

310
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,415
Russian meteor shower?

311
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:06,815
That was published article

312
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Publish an article quote

313
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
Suspected meteor explosion reported in central Cuba

314
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,263
They published this article with so little information

315
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
It was a real thing

316
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
So they had to add this absurd editor's note

317
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Quote there is a lot

318
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
Capital letters

319
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,319
Direct Auto

320
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,951
Okay there is a lot of disinformation floating around about this possible occurrence

321
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
And I know I wrote it

322
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
The word occurrence here

323
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Is misspelled

324
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Good editor's note

325
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Stonework

326
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Satisfied

327
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:52,639
No videos or images of the supposed surfaced from reputable sources at the time of writing

328
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
Fun fact

329
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
The articles

330
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Supposed

331
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
He's just a copy and pasting of an article in Xena

332
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
State-run paper out by the Communist Party

333
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,231
Something you definitely wouldn't think that would be on Alex's Rolodex

334
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Copy and paste articles from

335
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Wait

336
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Okay

337
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
These types of bulshit headlines at

338
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
The irresponsible reporting

339
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Analysis

340
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:29,247
Sentences that the media came down in Russia could be related to the larger

341
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
Class B. Literally no reason

342
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
I think that was the case

343
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
It all adds up to Imports doing a really bad job with meteor

344
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
2013

345
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,255
Their behavior shows a clear desire

346
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
To kick-off some sort of fear and paranoia

347
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
But he was very non-committal and I think that's what hurt

348
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
They went half speed

349
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
Which any football coach will tell you is when injuries happen

350
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
You're going to f****** your propaganda game would you go halves

351
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
That's when you get here

352
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
Real hard

353
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,719
So the situation is that the Atlantic article accurately covered

354
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
Alex is projecting onto them

355
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,631
Some sort of lie

356
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
And it's really it's really silly

357
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Describe it

358
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
So it kind of feels like Alex

359
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
Defensive towards

360
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
You peace that they that the Atlantic wasn't talkin

361
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
No I think it's these defensive about his larger Corpus

362
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
I think it's an issue

363
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
It's also

364
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
I don't think he likes it whenever

365
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
Even mentioned at all in an article that has

366
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Debunked

367
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
He's being associated with these

368
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Things that are being done

369
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
As opposed to him being one of the only

370
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
News

371
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Quote news sources

372
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
Have a large platform

373
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,599
Even dip their toe into the dumb but this was

374
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Hoodsite

375
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,047
I don't know that's on him

376
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,375
Nobody's coming to Rally behind me or god dammit

377
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,215
You're in the pool

378
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,335
It doesn't exclude will you find out that you know

379
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
What is frustrated by the

380
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Discover him

381
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
You know if he'd had his

382
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
His druthers

383
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,039
Never be getting disorder coverage

384
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Farming again

385
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
The people who are at odds with the oil painters are of course

386
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Okay okay

387
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
How do you summon

388
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
People plus a day

389
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:33,568
Artist who decided to quit in order to fight a perceived global

390
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,712
War never heard that before

391
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,528
Weird well there's a big difference

392
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,808
Apparently

393
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
The internet says that Hitler was there we go

394
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,768
Do you work for PETA

395
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:04,288
Selling his old oil pay $1,000 on the boardwalk

396
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,616
Remember to Boardwalk

397
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
I need to pay

398
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Within the context of me taken

399
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
Describing it I believe

400
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
He started selling

401
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Cheaper on the street

402
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,208
And then people started to come around later

403
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
That they're like

404
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,168
I need get me and Alex I want to say this very clearly

405
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
If anybody

406
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,520
Knows how to track

407
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
I don't know how I'll pay for it

408
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,712
But I will find a way I don't care I will

409
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Now that being said I'm not sure the exact

410
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
And anybody has one

411
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Or knows where I can

412
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,368
Taiwan

413
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,952
I'll probably pay like 200 bucks

414
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
Hey by the way Alex

415
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Bye-bye Alex if you listening

416
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
You need two hundred bucks

417
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,984
Just make one now

418
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,384
I'm disappointed never

419
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
The Pretender right Road

420
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,952
It's in his fantasy backstory

421
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,280
What's.

422
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,352
Throughout

423
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,984
Having a lot of feelings about the Nigerian email

424
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,592
This comes after him

425
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Doing his normal spiel about the Nigerian

426
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
What's interesting

427
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Refine

428
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
News about what happened in the second

429
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,184
Of the email scam which implies

430
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,256
He's probably

431
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,840
Marion Diehl

432
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
But you got to put

433
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
So he knows what happens if you fall for the scam how the scam evolve

434
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,024
And also where would he be getting the money to send to the Nigerian prince sales

435
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
It all fits also took out a huge insurance policy

436
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,288
Put it all together that's what happened

437
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,336
Show is

438
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Silly

439
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
I was listening to it on like this

440
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Is

441
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Not a good show

442
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,088
Worse but in a much different one

443
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
And that is

444
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
Because Alex

445
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
It comes in

446
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:05,024
And it is Oath Keepers founder Stewart Road coming back in

447
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
Gunn weirdo

448
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
We love guns

449
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:16,288
Call Sandra.

450
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
But I found particularly interesting

451
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
And worth discussing

452
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
And here is the first one

453
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,440
Fulton County County

454
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,512
Accounting

455
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
They're not going to comply

456
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
Tom Lauria Fulton County

457
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,904
Either retire or go to prison

458
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
For those guys

459
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,536
You're coming in talking about this is a molon labe count

460
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
I have those really interest

461
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
January 2013

462
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,264
Roads in The Oath Keepers launched what they called The molon labe Pledge

463
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Where they declared that they will never Reg

464
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,896
Just never

465
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Castration of weapons

466
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,528
And they would violently resist quote the breakers who try and disarm

467
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
On their website this Pacific

468
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
Quote

469
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
This is the Pledge we published in January 2013 in response

470
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Selective calls

471
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Four more in French

472
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
To keep and bear arms after the Sandy Hook shooting

473
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
That writing is specifically signed by Stewart Road

474
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:52,288
It is explicitly saying that he was compelled to write this pledge for his group of Gunn weirdos

475
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
In response to his feelings

476
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Which is interesting

477
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,944
But I found this even more interesting

478
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,968
We know that

479
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
Before January just before January

480
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Launch

481
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Molon labe shirt

482
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Which he announced

483
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
On his January 11th

484
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,720
Show the best seller of

485
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Never sold

486
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,120
All that thing she doesn't know how to pronounce Bola de l'abbaye it says quote

487
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Monet label

488
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,152
The expression molon labe popular among right-wing militia types for a while

489
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,760
Adidas shirt who's clearly ripping off something that was cool in the Subterranean world

490
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
List

491
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm trying to sell it to the main

492
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,672
Cuz he was even unaware of what how to say

493
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
Whereof it enough

494
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,304
But he didn't really know

495
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
So he was laundering.

496
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
That's the feeling I had

497
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
A perfect analogy for what does with his rhetoric

498
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
But what's more interesting

499
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Tumi is the Stewart Road

500
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Didn't make his molon labe played

501
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
Until after Alex released

502
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
Shirt and if you

503
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Cellar

504
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Could you have here is an interest

505
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Glimpse at a business

506
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
In terms of rhetoric

507
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,648
Alex

508
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Bucked up worlds of

509
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Acceptable

510
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
The more mainstream audio

511
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
In the process

512
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
He bought at Isaac

513
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Shirts

514
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,448
Bumper stickers

515
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
All the lights

516
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,752
Take this

517
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,544
Gross world

518
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Ideas

519
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,616
Shines them up and then markets

520
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Then

521
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
The representative is f***** up world to Alex's

522
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Platform

523
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Take the product

524
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,344
He's created based off of rhetoric that comes out of their world

525
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
And sells it back to

526
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Extremist

527
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
I think that there's a cycle gear

528
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,024
It's also the the cycle of

529
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,376
The more you Market this to people the more people see it and

530
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Get associated with it and it normalizes molon labe arises that then

531
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Brings it back

532
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
Alex starts

533
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
Recycling

534
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:08,480
And it's a little bit further more money off this if you just

535
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Let's say some weird

536
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Three percenter Shirt Company

537
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,208
Made a molon labe it's much more Market penetration centralization

538
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Of concept

539
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Etcetera

540
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
And it's also pretty easy

541
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,912
Alex is enterita Trump s*** having a pretty similar

542
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,008
With him stealing Hillary for prison as a line that he read on a bumper sticker

543
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:42,016
None of this is David Alex doesn't actually want a war to break out over guns or that he doesn't want Hillary in prison

544
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
Look at this

545
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,624
There's a kind of a parasitic marketing relation

546
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Between Alex and

547
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Community

548
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Follow a pattern

549
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
I don't know I ate I just find it very interesting

550
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
You know that Oath Keepers had been

551
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Around four years

552
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,240
Do a molon labe

553
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
Tell Alex released his bowl

554
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
There's a

555
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
There's something

556
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
Wondering

557
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Black chicken and eggs

558
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,088
Situation

559
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
The dumb Oath Keepers

560
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,440
Talk to Alex

561
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
See that shirt out there

562
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,000
And then are like

563
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,560
Okay cool we can capitalize on

564
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,888
Were they the ones who gave Alex the ID and the

565
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
The first place

566
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,752
He put the shirt out there and then they can release their pledge

567
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
It's already

568
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,104
I think it's probably closer to the second

569
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Let the world

570
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432
Where is The Oath Keepers Fester

571
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Yeah

572
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Going back to

573
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
Formation

574
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,088
Call Patriot militia

575
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
Molon labe with something

576
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
Was

577
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
It exists

578
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,256
It is a catchphrase

579
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
And a cold

580
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
In those worlds already

581
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
Okay okay

582
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
To like the 300

583
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
The Spartans

584
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
From a historical perspective

585
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
You can go back that far

586
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
American

587
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
It did exist

588
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Since like the early 2000

589
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,344
So I think Alex ripped it off from that

590
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,416
Whether or not it was a field

591
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
But I

592
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Function I think

593
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
You're describing is a

594
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
In the way each serves each other

595
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,376
There's purposes

596
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Capitalize off

597
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
The actions of

598
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
Yeah I agree

599
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Clip

600
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Trying to start something physical

601
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:01,536
Virgin

602
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
You know plan in Fremont

603
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
So

604
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,344
This makes no sense

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,464
Stewardess saying that he tells his guys to prepare a 3-month Spurs

606
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
So you got to do whatever you can buy April 9th

607
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
But this episode is taken

608
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Place on February

609
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192
17th which you may or may not know is not 3 months before April

610
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
So I decided to see

611
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:45,056
What's 3 months before April 19th roads up to

612
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
And on January 19th

613
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,664
2013

614
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Cordially

615
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
In Idaho

616
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
He's three months nonsense has nothing

617
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
To do with the choices

618
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
He chose April 19th

619
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,048
Because that's the day when the battles of Lexington and Concord

620
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Started back in 70

621
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
1575 Revolutionary War

622
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
We are grown up

623
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
Really interesting

624
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Because it tells you what these guys are obsessed

625
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
They're not really obsessed with the underlying causes of the American Revolution

626
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,944
Because if they were

627
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
To memorialize

628
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
December 16th

629
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
Vanoss and honor of the boss

630
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
Party

631
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
We could go with November 1st

632
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
In memory of the past

633
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
Fortiva

634
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,208
Immortalized

635
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Successful conclusion

636
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,792
The six-year uprise in The Regulators

637
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
Carolina

638
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
There are many many options for a date

639
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Stuart Rosen

640
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
When is gun weirdo friends could use

641
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
But you chose

642
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
April 9th

643
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
They chose this day

644
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,872
Because it was the day when their version of Justified Violence

645
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,640
Kicked off

646
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
And I fantasize about being able to relieve that

647
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
So desperate

648
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,064
Scholars of the Revolutionary War would probably be on white

649
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,624
Play the say that the war started with the battles of Lexington

650
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,720
They would probably be likelier to say that

651
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
The Escalade

652
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,280
Listen to a shooting War started

653
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
That is why the date resonates so much for these militia picture

654
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,448
Because they want that to happen again

655
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
If they didn't then we probably have a more robust

656
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Analysis

657
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
The forces that led up

658
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
To the eventual shot heard round the world

659
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
As opposed to

660
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
Just talk about how the British

661
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
We're going to see the weapons

662
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
And that started the war

663
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
It's f****** nuts

664
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
For people so obsessed with the revolution who screamed about the

665
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:38,976
76 it's wild that I have never heard Alex bring up the Intolerable Acts

666
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,280
I've never heard him bring up at Oz

667
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
Suffolk resolves Place

668
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
The Patriots of Massachusetts

669
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
It was state of open Rebellion again

670
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Against the British

671
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,800
I've never heard any of that from

672
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
None of this sort of analysis

673
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Your argument is

674
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Stupid and I suspect

675
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
It's partially that way because their argument isn't

676
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
Sphere

677
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
The idea that gun compass

678
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
Navigation caused the American Revolution is not

679
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Anybody could

680
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Seriously argue on the merits

681
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
But it works really well

682
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
If what you really want to do is math

683
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Your underlying desire to

684
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
Peculiar political rivals

685
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
And you need a justification

686
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
That seems to be what's going on

687
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
If it weren't

688
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
Stuart would have probably chosen

689
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
For his imaginary end

690
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Three-month preparation

691
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,152
I think these people belie what they're so interested in

692
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,688
With the way

693
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
They present

694
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
No ice

695
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Before these guys

696
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
Really want to kill somebody

697
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,720
And they know that they can't do it first

698
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
Yeah that's what they want they want

699
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Can't do it

700
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,120
Without any control specific

701
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
Types of human beings

702
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
No sake

703
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,056
I think I don't want to.

704
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,640
I'm kind of old Betsy Ross I think they would be pretty sad

705
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456
If they killed another militia guy

706
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Pretty safe

707
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,816
The Sunday show so go to Shorter show that

708
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,120
Is much going on

709
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Fences

710
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
About his coverage of the

711
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Meteor

712
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Stewart Road

713
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
Yelling about guns

714
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Silly fun

715
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
And

716
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
Alex was very

717
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
Trigger

718
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
About people talking about his meteor coverage

719
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,272
Another bit of

720
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Criticism

721
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Of his argue

722
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Come out in the media

723
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,648
And Alex is not happy about that

724
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,424
It ran in

725
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
The analogy used to murder all pay

726
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Patriots

727
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,400
So

728
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
In some respects

729
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Screaming

730
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Alex

731
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,064
Complain about the media covering him unfairly

732
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
In this case is related to his

733
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,184
But the federal government is buying a

734
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,536
6 billion rounds of ammunition

735
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
It's strange

736
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,472
6 billion people represent 1% of gun owners

737
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,752
The gun control measures

738
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
The government

739
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
6 billion bullets

740
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
This is the sort of thing that I said

741
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Just going to drive any numerologist you might be listen

742
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Completely insane

743
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,088
The average family has 1.6 children all my God

744
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
The crypto Fibonacci number

745
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
I don't know

746
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Understanding of what the articles

747
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
They're saying

748
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
They agree with Alex

749
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Government

750
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
6 billion bullets

751
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Conclusion was

752
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
And that very easily available facts contradict his stories

753
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
The details in order to escalate paranoia

754
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,856
All the right-wing sites that cover the ammunition purchase

755
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,416
Constantly frame it is Obama buying all these

756
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,720
These bullets

757
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:33,632
In reality what happened was that the government of put out requests for people to bid on contracts

758
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
The provided very large number of

759
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,520
Presumably around the 1.6 billion number that Alex site

760
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,568
It might be less than that but I'm not really a

761
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Splitting hairs

762
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
The reason the people are unwilling to say that Alex is right

763
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
Despite him being

764
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,248
Pretty much right about the government

765
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
It's because all the stuff he says they're buying

766
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
At 4

767
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
I need to bury a annoying around this imagine

768
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Purchase

769
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:00,256
When the truth is that they were buying the ammo for training and shooting range

770
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
End of the contract they were looking

771
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
Still work for the next

772
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
5 years

773
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,656
It's not like they wanted one points

774
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
6 billion bullets

775
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
To show up ready to go tomorrow

776
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
It was over the next

777
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Of course

778
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Half a decade

779
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,104
And their idea was that if they could vote

780
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
Contract with a huge purchase

781
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
The federal government might be able to get a better price

782
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,784
At first glance 1.6 billion is a joke

783
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
A Second Glance

784
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
It's still a gigantic

785
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,488
But if you start to consider how many federal law enforcement agencies there are and how many agents

786
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,768
The train at State train

787
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
That number is reflecting a five-year

788
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Apply for all those purposes

789
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
It doesn't really seem like that crazy

790
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Your number after all

791
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
If you want have a conversation but how

792
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
It is that our law enforcement practice

793
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
This revolves so heavily around weaponry

794
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,872
Maybe we should disarm the police

795
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
Conversation

796
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
The fact that

797
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
And the fact that it gradually becomes

798
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,928
Less

799
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
And saying that it's 1.6

800
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
6 billion

801
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
Seems ridiculously normalizing

802
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
2 something

803
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,680
Really really bad.

804
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,520
And it's crazy looking at it

805
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
Hi early different perspective than Alex

806
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
We can have complaints about the

807
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
Complaints be completely incompatible

808
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
So the meeting was taking issue with Alex

809
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
Consistent with the bullets

810
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,320
For the government's use in a war against

811
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:33,952
Which is a very especially when a very reasonable explanation is readily available

812
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
He was sort of right

813
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,328
Because most generous

814
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,400
They might say he's right about a fact

815
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Did wrong button

816
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
Interpretation

817
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
If I were running this media Outlets

818
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
I probably would not have been so diplomatic

819
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,336
I probably would have said that he was using the

820
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
July

821
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Because that's what he's doing

822
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
I don't

823
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Complaints fall on deaf ears

824
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,855
A bit over the past

825
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,207
Few years of trump

826
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
We need to treat them fairly and we don't save it

827
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
We say that

828
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,375
Mismanaged

829
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
The point where most news outlets

830
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
Trump lied about that

831
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,335
Not enough probably

832
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
More than there were

833
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Yeah

834
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,991
Back in 2013

835
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Nobody would say that

836
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,487
Except for Joe Wilson

837
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,535
Wow

838
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,327
I don't think so

839
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
Most of the show that Alex is doing is about

840
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,751
Like a lot of the show is taking up with his complaints about the

841
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
The media coverage of Heaven Howard's asiop

842
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,735
Russian with this video

843
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Did the government

844
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
1.6

845
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,551
Billion bullets

846
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
It's just come

847
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
This whole thing is just exercising

848
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,279
I think I'm mostly pulled this quick cuz I think it's funny

849
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Alex

850
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
Play the clip

851
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
From CNN

852
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,399
Reliable sources

853
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
Shell which is

854
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Free Brian stelter

855
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Is always

856
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Axe to grind

857
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:36,575
Metaphor

858
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
It's very own brand

859
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
Discussion is going on in the clip

860
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,279
He plays is someone I don't know who it is

861
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,815
Unreliable sources

862
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
Why is the f*** with Piers Morgan

863
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Even book

864
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,679
Alex Jones

865
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Is Joe

866
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Does anybody know what Alex

867
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,823
Pyrite

868
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
I just

869
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,719
I love the idea that he's interrupting the clamp to complain of a organ interrupting

870
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:52,863
Delicious irony

871
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,911
Sources also

872
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,935
Hooking interrupt

873
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
Ironically

874
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,287
Most of the show has been a ham

875
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Complaints

876
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
About media articles about

877
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
Why are you covering that

878
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
Because

879
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Exact

880
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
So

881
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
You know obviously

882
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
The audience is going to be

883
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,903
Having the same thoughts

884
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Alex is just

885
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,047
Cover himself self-aggrandizing

886
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,399
No Alex defending himself

887
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
From the

888
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Possible

889
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Interpretation that he's

890
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Just covering any news

891
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
That much was sure

892
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,527
Russia

893
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,183
It's just incredible

894
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,279
14

895
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Not

896
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
It's just

897
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
It's just sad

898
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Just said

899
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,495
Even even his cameraman after hearing that must have been like little s*** bulshit

900
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,591
Like there's no way that you can say we didn't even cover that.

901
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
Complains a little bit more about this at

902
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Acquire

903
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
It's interesting

904
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Because

905
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,415
He's accusing them of lying

906
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
About them

907
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,047
It's weird they interrupt too much

908
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Face

909
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Bumpkin some bunk

910
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:13,151
He is gas-lighting hard it's like

911
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,711
This is how he mainstream's illiteracy

912
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
Responding to a false

913
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,023
Presentation of these articles

914
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,863
Russian

915
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
A response that is

916
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,311
You said that

917
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:47,455
Because for the most part

918
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
He can't

919
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
So this is

920
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,575
Sincere misinterpretation on his

921
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
When is malicious

922
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Right and then

923
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,023
I'm going to jump ahead towards the end of the episode now because Alex

924
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,303
Call her later

925
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
Who Alex

926
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Complained

927
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
About how about him

928
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,959
And the car has a really interesting response

929
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Let's do it

930
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,695
I don't expect anything more

931
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,567
This caller is going to be

932
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,943
His version of it and his sworn off any

933
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,295
Never going to go find the articles that Alex was about

934
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,855
Self-contained and inoculated

935
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,695
Facebook

936
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,511
Jesus and that color almost

937
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,327
Perfectly embodies the

938
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
The gross aspect

939
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
Difficult

940
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
It's it's very much

941
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,263
It's exactly like a

942
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Like it's him

943
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,079
Cutting off his family from

944
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,199
Contact cuz they're suppressive person

945
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:31,135
The other aspect of the authority of the cult leader

946
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Where is called into question

947
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
There's some sort of dismissiveness

948
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,743
Punished

949
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
Yeah another caller

950
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
I have one more question

951
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,191
2126

952
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Million

953
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,775
Bullet Paul Watson

954
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,335
I recorded that the DHS purchase

955
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:56,735
Yes there's a lot of people online saying that he read the solicitation wrong and exactly like 240

956
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Bowser

957
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,327
Probably robots

958
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
Do you have at the cult leader is

959
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Corrected

960
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,959
Infallible is immediately box

961
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,519
People saying that a robot

962
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
Long Branch

963
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,431
Screaming about how right he is about everything

964
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:31,039
I wanted to pull some clips I mean it's not any different than any other

965
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
Screaming and it's one of those things that reveals

966
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,999
Every cult leaders deep AB insecurities behind

967
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,327
They never feel comfortable and so they trying

968
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
Can create this bubble wear

969
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
They always feel

970
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,263
It's a it's a coping f***** up

971
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
That it was based on what that color we just heard

972
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Challenge

973
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
Cut it discusses like

974
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,647
Yeah that caller East you know

975
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,743
You can always said we're not right and I'm like oh my God this is all

976
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
Response to that caller

977
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,583
But this is business

978
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,143
So you get done with the rat and then he says this

979
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
And it sounds

980
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Little teeny

981
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Screaming at Authority

982
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,871
Earlier

983
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,351
I'm sorry I went on that unhinged

984
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
So I triggered by a collar question whether I got some facts wrong little bit

985
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,615
All the time

986
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:04,479
Billy starting New World Order 100%

987
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
He is a loser little titty

988
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Ridiculous

989
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:12,159
So I want the beginning of this episode that there was going to be apportioned it was going

990
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
We have arrived

991
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
So

992
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
If you are particularly since

993
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,863
Some f*****-up topic

994
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,167
Now might be a time might want to

995
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Question

996
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Skip ahead 20 minutes

997
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,591
Because at this point on this February

998
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Encountered

999
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
And listening to his show

1000
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Before

1001
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Really want

1002
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
No

1003
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,839
Usher

1004
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Probably know who David Clark

1005
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:01,567
If not that he's the sheriff who used to show up on Fox News sometimes

1006
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Wear a cowboy hat

1007
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:07,199
I was fake decorative military medals he just giving himself looking like a real dick

1008
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
He came to Fairmont of attention when he spoke at the Republican National

1009
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
Convention in 26

1010
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
2017

1011
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
We also started

1012
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
Play pretty heavily that he wasn't consideration for a position

1013
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
Was Trump's Department of Homeland

1014
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Security

1015
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,791
That position ever materialized

1016
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
And we can all consider ourselves lucky that it did

1017
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
Because David Clark is a f****** Madman

1018
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:31,519
And will probably be in consideration for worst botter and Sheriff Joe Arpaio today

1019
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
That's great

1020
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
Before he was the sheriff

1021
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
David Clarke was a Milwaukee patrol car

1022
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
Joining the force in 1970

1023
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,991
As he rose through the ranks clerk was very careful

1024
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
To the media

1025
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,855
When he was selected to replace live Baldwin

1026
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Retired Sheriff

1027
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
Milwaukee County

1028
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
In the middle of his term

1029
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,839
John Clarke ramped-up is Media presentation even further

1030
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,631
Expertly staging photoshoot

1031
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
Reading stories that made the

1032
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
The department look good into the media

1033
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,519
And always being seen in a full moon

1034
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
However

1035
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,847
Behind that facade with a very

1036
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,687
A retired detective who worked with Clarksville Milwaukee magazine

1037
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Quote

1038
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,247
The people who love him don't know him

1039
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
The people who know him don't like him at all

1040
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
When he was in consideration

1041
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
For sheriff in 2002

1042
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,183
He suspiciously wasn't endorsed by the Milwaukee play

1043
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Police Association

1044
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,279
Even though he was the only Milwaukee Police Officer run

1045
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
Which I think speaks volumes

1046
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,167
Consider how close

1047
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
Police Union

1048
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,687
That guy is not good

1049
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,527
There's always been warning signs the Clark might be a really bad dude

1050
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,111
The 1994 Clark was accused of using excessive force

1051
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,391
15 year old boy

1052
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,231
The child's mother filed a complaint after Clark who was off duty

1053
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,535
Allegedly chased her son and his friends down

1054
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,815
Drew his gun on them

1055
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,095
And made them lie on the ground

1056
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,679
The boys want to five kids Clarksville throwing rocks at cars

1057
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,239
Accounts vary with the mother saying

1058
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:09,055
Your son in the head inside causing bruised ribs

1059
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:13,151
Report claiming he just quote used his foot to turn over one boy

1060
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
Which Meijer kind of sounds

1061
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Politely

1062
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Describing Kik

1063
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
You got it

1064
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
Whatever the case that is the complaint was dismissed

1065
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
Estimation ruled there was insufficient evidence

1066
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Later career implies

1067
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
This Mother's complaint

1068
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
Might have been valid

1069
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,863
Traditionally it's been the role of the sheriff's department to quote Patrol the highways overseas

1070
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,887
The jails and provides

1071
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:34,911
Security and courts

1072
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Reno County

1073
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,775
But the city police and was left to local

1074
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
Even though the

1075
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
Technically within the county

1076
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,479
What are the sheriff Clarke's big things with expanding the role of the Sheriff's Department

1077
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Involve itself

1078
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
SimCity matter

1079
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,343
As Milwaukee County Supervisor Gary Broderick

1080
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Put It quotes

1081
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
He's in post

1082
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
Himself on some other law enforcement agency

1083
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
Eddie's uninvited

1084
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,327
It would be one thing if he was doing a great job with a normal responsibilities of

1085
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,095
The Sheriff's Office

1086
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Just wanted to share his ex

1087
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,423
These other struggling depart

1088
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
But that was definitely not the

1089
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
According to Milwaukee magazine

1090
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
In the first few months of Clarkson

1091
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,175
First term quote his deputies got into a scuffle at the airport with police

1092
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Keith Jones

1093
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,015
A convicted murderer Wrestled a gun from a deputy in a downtown

1094
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:25,855
Did the deputy before being shot by police officer

1095
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,415
Prison

1096
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
Milwaukee prisoners Escape

1097
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,255
Van driven by 2:00 step

1098
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
I'm sure

1099
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,375
You could make the argument that it was just stuff that happened at the beginning of his term

1100
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,447
It's probably all just stuff it was lingering tub live Baldwin

1101
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Previous

1102
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,775
Time to sort things out

1103
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
And you'd be wrong

1104
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
Because things got way worse

1105
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
Is Clark Sturman office

1106
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Continue

1107
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:54,783
On September 13th 2010 and epileptic man had a seizure while restrained in Sheriff's cust

1108
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Officers didn't seem to care over soak

1109
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,391
Completely clueless that their actions made

1110
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Things worse

1111
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,463
Forty-one-year-old James Perry died

1112
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
On April 24th

1113
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
2060

1114
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Terrell Thomas died Welling

1115
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,399
Custody in the Milwaukee County Jail

1116
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
The medical examiner's office will go on today

1117
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Declare the case

1118
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
A homicide

1119
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,799
But when you get into the details it's pretty easy to see

1120
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Cy

1121
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Thomas died of dehydration

1122
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,175
9 days after being arrested and brought to the jail

1123
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
Thomas have been arrested on suspicion of shooting a man

1124
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
He was also bipolar

1125
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,135
So his behavior in the jail

1126
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
To place him in solitary confinement

1127
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Which one would be enough for me

1128
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Me to say f*** David

1129
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Clark

1130
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:43,679
The guards would claim that they did what they did because Thomas had previously tried to flood his cell but I don't believe that as an explanation

1131
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Super Why

1132
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,983
They shut off the water to

1133
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,591

00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,895
Thomas begging for Waterford days

1135
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Before he died

1136
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,967
And given the fact that he died of dehydration

1137
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
I think it's a pretty good bet that they give him

1138
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
This treatment of a person

1139
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,903
Completely horrifying regardless of what they may or may not have done

1140
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
To end up in custody

1141
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,231
The idea being incarcerated some

1142
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,023
Where put in solitary confinement

1143
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,047
Dehydrated to death

1144
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
Over the span of days

1145
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,375
Is a terror that no one should have to live

1146
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
In the end boys were charged

1147
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,007
For Thomas's death Milwaukee County

00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
The million dollars in a settlement

1150
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,615
But David Clark was never held response

1151
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
The travesty

1152
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
July 26th

1153
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,271
Steve Sade squeezer was incarcerated in prison

1154
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Her newborn child died

1155
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
County Jail

1156
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,463
In December 2015 Jennifer Johnson's newborn child suffered a similar fate after guards failed

1157
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,743
Provide appropriate help

1158
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,351
That's a Christian if I bring alcohol and heroin withdrawal

1159
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
County Jail in Milwaukee

1160
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,471
There's a serious pattern of negligence and outright brutality

1161
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
Exist undersheriff Clark's watch

1162
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
And it's also

1163
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359

Pregnant

Eventually gave birth in prison the county for the fact that she was made to give birth while Shackled

1175
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
This wasn't the only person

1176
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,447
Who suffered this kind of treatment

1177
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:26,079
It's estimated that at least 40 women who have given birth of David Clarksdale have had to do so while handcuffed

1178
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Labor

1179
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,151
Sheriff David Clarke is an absolute monster

1180
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,295
Any of these people had to suffer what they did

1181
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
But he didn't

1182
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
Instead he defended

1183
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,743
In labor 40 completely out of line

1184
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,023
Organization

1185
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
He was in charge of

1186
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,911
You may notice that a lot of these problems seem to have gotten worse toward the end of his

1187
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,239
And probably that's because by then

1188
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
And Savor becoming a national media

1189
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,871
In 2015 he launched a

1190
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,151
Called the people share

1191
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
On Glenn Beck's Blaze Network

1192
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,015
Weirdly that's same here Sheriff

01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
6 day trip to Russia

1194
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
Is part of the NRA delegation

1195
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
He's paid at least

1196
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,439
$6,000 to go on their trip from the group right to bear arms

1197
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,999
Which was the group run by Maria butina

1198
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,071
Who pled guilty in December 2018 to felony charges of can

1199

Unregistered foreign agent

1200
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Of the Russia

1201
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
And was sentenced to 18 years

1202
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
18 months in prison

1203
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,823
Legitimately no idea what he was doing there or what

1204
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
But it doesn't

1205
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Cool

1206
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,431
Parkwood Sheriff of Milwaukee County

1207
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
Money from 2002 to

1208
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,855
One of the likely reasons he was able to stay in office so long was he was registered as a Democrat

1209
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,927
Even though he was very obviously a far-right than

1210
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,975
A2000

1211
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,023
You cheered on the Iraq War going so far as to

1212
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,071
At a support our troops rally

1213
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
Scott Walker and Paul Ryan

1214
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,959
Where he expressed his off or George W Bush's quote will encourage

1215
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,799
Milwaukee is an insanely democrat-leaning area

1216
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,127
The county has only swung Republican

1217
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Three presidential elections

1218
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
12 and 2 of those three times

1219
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
Eisenhower

1220
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,319
Registering as a Democrat it being

1221
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
The complete opposite

1222
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
Is it really smart move

1223
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Particularly once you're already an offer

1224
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
You generally win any primaries

1225
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
General election

1226
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,119
Versus a Republican

1227
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
This is exactly what you see in every

1228
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,215
Election cycle for David Clarke

1229
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,519
Relatively narrow winds in the primary

1230
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,567
A crushing landslides in the General Lee

1231
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,871
I'm not

1232
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,199
But if you were a manipulative power-hungry piece of s***

1233
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
Your plans might look at

1234
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
Exactly like what David Clark did

1235
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,367
What do you step, Sheriff Clarke immediately took a position as a

1236
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Senior advisor for

1237
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
The truck backing

1238
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Super Super PAC

1239
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
America First action

1240
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:56,351
In 2017 to 2018 alone right-wing billionaire Sheldon Adelson

1241
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,631
10 million dollars

1242
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
List of that Super PAC

1243
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
They also received a lot of donation

1244
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,239
America First policies

1245
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,311
The political action committee we talked to what about a while

1246
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
Trump campaign official

1247
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
They received a lot of donations

1248
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,271
Probably because they are affiliated

1249
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:19,391
America versus policies is a nonprofit organization

1250
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
But they're basically

1251
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
This is a little bit of a non sequitur

1252
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,839
But also I know is involved with one of Alex Jones's sponsors

1253
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,447
The insane version of the NRA

1254
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
I was going to dig into that a little bit

1255
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Butts

1256
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,335
If you search for David Clark in gun owners for America

1257
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
The first thing

1258
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
Comes up as a completely batshit article

1259
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
SuperAmerica website

1260
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,015
It features an endorsement from Clark

1261
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
Spy comes up in the search results

1262
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
Uncle really isn't about him

1263
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,135
Headline is quote

1264
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,975
Is gone or do not overthrow America in your will

1265
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,535
The article begins

1266
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:02,399
What is one thing you can be sure that the Second Amendment rights are well defended well

1267
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
The future

1268
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,007
Putting gunownersofamerica in your will or trust

1269
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Settlements

1270
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,871
America's

1271
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
To defend your gun rights in the Press

1272
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:20,575
Take a lot of balls to be like hey man f*** your children and grandchildren getting inheritance

1273
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
About guns

1274
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Straight up

1275
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,415
Movie plot con man

1276
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
And they're doing it with

1277
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,055
The explicit endorsement of sheriff Clarke

1278
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
Yep he's literally

1279
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Fine

1280
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Yeah

1281
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:57,183
When someone dies of dehydration in jail after

1282
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,511
People who work for you turn off the water to their cell

1283
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,863
Do you go to prison

1284
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
What happens if you

1285
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
100%

1286
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,519
A murderer who is allowed to walk

1287
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,591
Because America is a f***

1288
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Garbage fire of akka

1289
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah after this interview with Alec

1290
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,599
Before and somebody's indications

1291
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
In the time

1292
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
For there is every reason to have a very serious.

1293
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Destructive David

1294
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,487
Clark even in 20

1295
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
A very serious problem

1296
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
With how he ran

1297
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,095
His Sheriff's Department

1298
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,631
The encroachment of City

1299
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Police

1300
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
That the rhetoric that you was putting out

1301
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
It was

1302
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,335
Concern Alex buddying up with him

1303
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,615
It's not on

1304
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Expected but

1305
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:54,271
It's f***** up really really don't like it really loves play

1306
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Mussolini

1307
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,951
If you see somebody play-acting and wearing metals

1308
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,303
It's a good thing to assume they're probably either a really good actor

1309
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,215
So I also didn't surprise until

1310
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:18,591
Pop-up based on the fact that Alex is really on to the sheriff right now

1311
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,199
Play constitutional sheriffs

1312
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,759
Owners of America connect

1313
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
David Clarke

1314
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
Makes total sense

1315
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,159
He was named like Sheriff of the year

1316
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
At some point

1317
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
Also just because

1318
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
This is a fun fact

1319
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,047
And Larry Pratt runs going under through America and

1320
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Incahoots

1321
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,959
Fun fact Larry Pratt was super against the move to Washington

1322
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
Three Senators back in night

1323
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
1879

1324
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
He was quoted

1325
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,079
Quote

1326
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,359
The amendment would bring in

1327
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,663
Would probably be minority

1328
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,711
It would definitely be liberal on Gunn

1329
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,527
Control course

1330
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
Be liberal

1331
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,879
The first thought you have

1332
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:06,975
Senior opposition to the plan is that the Senators would like

1333
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
Weird

1334
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
The same reason that sheriff Clarke was invited to speak because they want a black man

1335
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
In order to justify

1336
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:22,335
Hating black people I've been pretending that it's not just cuz it's a pretty strong trend

1337
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
You see like I was reading this article from

1338
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,151
2003

1339
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,735
And may quote Scott Walker from before he was governor

1340
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
City Council

1341
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
Remember

1342
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Some stripe

1343
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
And one of the comments

1344
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:41,279
There's no way they could get away with saying these things about the black Democratic leaders

1345
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,375
And it's because I know Scott Walker is that sounds

1346
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,959
Pretty f*****-up Scott Walker

1347
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,007
Then

1348
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
I get what you're saying

1349
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Transparent

1350
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
It is

1351
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,759
Like I have transparent it really is how race

1352
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
Vera Lynn today are

1353
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Otherwise

1354
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:10,975
To give themselves Avenue

1355
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:16,095
Pizzava

1356
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,655
Probably more pressing

1357
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
Tuesday

1358
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Trojan Horse

1359
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Absolutely

1360
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Something that shouldn't be

1361
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,991
Call Stover

1362
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
But

1363
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,831
Being completely

1364
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
Out of control with your departure

1365
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Or your

1366
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
Tying down pregnant women

1367
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,303
Yourself

1368
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
Senior prison

1369
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Human rights

1370
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
AR

1371
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
Yeah but

1372
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,735
To me the fact that the militia dudes

1373
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
On his tip

1374
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
And the cons

1375
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
Institutional Sheriff tip movement

1376
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Entirely

1377
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,951
Is they always

1378
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,975
Lyin Eyes

1379
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
Respect

1380
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,047
You are an utter Psych

1381
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Like

1382
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Purely

1383
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
Cruel Psych

1384
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,935
As almost

1385
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
An aspiration that

1386
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,287
Power

1387
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,847
To destroy their own empathy

1388
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
It has been looking up to

1389
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,503
For sure and then the other part of it is like

1390
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,063
The Constitutional sheriffs that exist

1391
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
Constantly talk about how they don't have

1392
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,671
I don't report to the police

1393
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,231
Yeah yeah yeah

1394
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,023
John Wayne type

1395
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,303
Right image

1396
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,583
Is something that they

1397
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Just can't get enough of

1398
01:08:53,887 --> 01:09:00,031
That idea putting themselves

1399
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,335
Most Authority complete

1400
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,359
Control of everything

1401
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,407
I could take care of the problem

1402
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
And they projected onto

1403
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:07,967
Is that

1404
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,807
Yeah

1405
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
Almost without exception

1406
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
Every single one of these Sheriff

1407
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,487
That I come up on

1408
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:25,375
Nowhere near power people are crazy

1409
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:29,215
Some of them

1410
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,567
I will not endorse any

1411
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
Healthy Sheriff

1412
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
Yeah

1413
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,199
I think calling them all serial killers

1414
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
Unfair to

1415
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
1 or 20 count

1416
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:48,159
102

1417
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,511
Yeah so I think that probably is about to

1418
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
The really f***** up

1419
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,815
Clark

1420
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
There's some other stuff by David Clarke

1421
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
Bears mentioning

1422
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
I'm sure I meant the first is

1423
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Why is he on

1424
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Michelle

1425
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
It's because he just put out a p

1426
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Yes

1427
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,591
Alex is super into

1428
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,687
I am self-funding of course I was setting last clip he was on P

1429
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,271
Piers Morgan show

1430
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,575
TSA was really f***** up

1431
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
Sears Alex introducing it

1432
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Dpsa

1433
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,559
I'm sure of David Clarke and I want to talk to you about something personal

1434
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Your safety

1435
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
No longer a spectator sport I need you in the game

1436
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
But are you ready

1437
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,799
With officers laid-off of furloughed Simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best option

1438
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:41,151
You can beg for mercy full of filing criminal hide under the bed or you can fight back

1439
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Are you prepared

1440
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:48,831
Consider taking a certified safety course in having a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there never duty to protect

1441
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
Yourself and your family we're Partners now

1442
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,975
Can I count on you

1443
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
As We Know

1444
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Who paid for it

1445
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:07,775
It's not the only around this 2013.

1446
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,847
Much to the Chagrin of the Milwaukee County finance

1447
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,967
A 2012 car spent over $22,000 on personalized radio

1448
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,807
By June 2013

1449
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Thousand dollars

1450
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
Do taxpayer money

1451
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,183
So he could grandstand and promote his own personal brand

1452
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Naturally this lied to the finance

1453
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:32,607
Committee voting to do this sort of self-aggrandizing bulshit

1454
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,215
Some Dum Dums out there were arguing that they were putting a gag order on Clark

1455
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,031
But supervisor Patricia

1456
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,079
Who started the motion disagree

1457
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,639
I don't have a bandana big enough

1458
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,407
Have to gag the sheriff

1459
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,455
You see what you saying is that he's a f******

1460
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,479
Can blow hard

1461
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,039
These PSAs Vicky madarsa

1462
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
So f***** up

1463
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,159
If you really break it down it's a sheriff telling people that police can't help them

1464
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,975
And they better get ready to kill someone breaking into their home

1465
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
Which is something

1466
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,911
Glorifies kind of what I thought

1467
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
Sheriff

1468
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,471
Send out a PSA that's like

1469
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:15,871
Cops are going to be there fast enough do you know what to do if you have a passport

1470
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,431
Well okay you're in charge of the sheriff's

1471
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
The other Pope

1472
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:24,319
Police Department yeah supposed to be completely separate you're saying like

1473
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,367
These other organizations

1474
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,391
Also cat

1475
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,927
I responded time

1476
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:29,951
It's really sucks

1477
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Deeply

1478
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,583
And If You Smell Trouble

1479
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Be decisive

1480
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
Use the element of surprise

1481
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:43,519
Against your attacker and most importantly be ruthless and your response

1482
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,503
Always going to f*** with you and make sure

1483
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
Well if they're in your home

1484
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,391
Do you know if it's a home Invader I understand using self-defense

1485
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
Obviously it would be probably better

1486
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Pasta

1487
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
I'm somehow it supposed to

1488
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,815
Specifically talking about

1489
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:15,007
Encouraging

1490
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Random vigilante

1491
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:22,687
Just take the random

1492
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,247
So the premise of the PSA is it at their layoffs

1493
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,575
And the sheriff's department employees are furloughed

1494
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
It's time for 6

1495
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,671
To be cops is around Little House size video

1496
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
You see the Department's going through

1497
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
X Financial

1498
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,047
I probably unsurprisingly

1499
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:42,655
A close look at why you find it's mostly David Clark's fault

1500
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:48,287
Surprise me interesting directions

1501
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Of money that came into the

1502
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:54,943
Department through civil asset forfeiture something Alex is very totally sincerely

1503
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
Reddit spent 11,000

1504
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,295
$400 out of workout equipment

1505
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
7000

1506
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,135
Hundred dollars for a police Harley-Davidson

1507
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,463
$77,000

1508
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
And what's

1509
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Yeah I got a horse

1510
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,863
$24,900 each

1511
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,631
Nations train

1512
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,543
What to do the new destination thought that it was possible that it was

1513
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
Ettore's

1514
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
Like because if you look for Disney destination

1515
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
Google

1516
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
Some parts of Disney

1517
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,575
Apparently it's supposed to be about quote Disney

1518
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,855
Approach to business

1519
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,415
So they're getting training

1520
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,951
Standard of Excellence

1521
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:40,511
In order to run their jails better or something

1522
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
It makes absolutely no sense

1523
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:47,167
Whatever they have to teach you has nothing to do with it with a sheriff's department is doing

1524
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
It's a waste of

1525
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
$25,000

1526
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,799
Didn't we have a war

1527
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,127
Trials where it's like even if you're just following orders

1528
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,735
You're probably also like you have a responsibility to it.

1529
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
Employees

1530
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
Someone should I

1531
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,303
65 new Glock

1532
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
Outfitted with glow-in-the-dark

1533
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:21,983
565 guns for a department of only 275 officers

1534
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,287
County Supervisor John

1535
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
Junior quote

1536
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,663
There was a two-for-one sale there is absolutely no reason to justify

1537
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
Royce Silver

1538
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,551
President of the Milwaukee County deputy sheriff's Association

1539
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,135
They believe that this money could have been better spent helping

1540
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,415
Reinstate laid off

1541
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,999
Throughout his time in office

1542
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
Constantly try to cut cost

1543
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
By shooting

1544
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Responsibilities from

1545
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,399
Sheriff's deputies to lower-paid employees

1546
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Correctional Office

1547
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:56,031
Many of the jobs at his milk Milwaukee County like monitoring inmate

1548
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
Worked all those responsibilities

1549
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
Ring shifted away

1550
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,711
Money all WellSpan

1551
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,015
Things are cool like glow-in-the-dark gunsight

1552
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Dark Horse

1553
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,343
Which also kind of dog tails with

1554
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,415
That are happening in his jail

1555
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,487
Is it possible that that has something to do with the

1556
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:20,351
Less qualified employees who are now in charge of monitoring employee

1557
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,631
I don't know

1558
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
That's for someone else to study

1559
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
You know the only person who really

1560
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:32,127
Need like a vigilante to handcuff them and ensure that they don't hurt the rest

1561
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Country

1562
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,807
Yeah we need a group of people to just like

1563
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Hold on to him

1564
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
Bearhug

1565
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:48,255
Can you be sent to the hateful things you do internally in a country

1566
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
He should be sent to one of his own prison

1567
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
I don't know which that even upon

1568
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,191
The claim that underlies these PSAs

1569
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,495
Every tears that all about

1570
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,543
Their physical difficulties of the Sheriff's Department

1571
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
He played a huge rule

1572
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,943
Or at least

1573
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
Another Factor

1574
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015
Considerate

1575
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:11,039
Ego Live cost

1576
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,135
He came out 2016 at the county had paid at least

1577
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,183
$10,000

1578
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,511
For Clark's lawyer to represent

1579
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,791
In addition to that

1580
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,119
Account you paid $83,000 more to defend itself

1581
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,143
In those suits

1582
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,983
That's about $400,000 that wouldn't

1583
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
If pork with.

1584
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Listen to his job

1585
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:36,383
Clark is like all of these supposed Patriots Sheriff's that Alex idolizes

1586
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,663
The petty tyrant

1587
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Hooters

1588
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,247
Degrees terrorized the very people there's more

1589
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Check answer

1590
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,063
In the strongest

1591
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,623
F*** this guy on the horse you rode in on

1592
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
Would cost Milwaukee County 77,000

1593
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
I hate him so much is really wanted to work

1594
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
I knew some of the awful and egregious things that he

1595
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,983
Exactly

1596
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Like

1597
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,567
What are your father's stuff about like

1598
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,871
Feuds with city council people

1599
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,623
One guy who is

1600
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
Is budget of Heaven

1601
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,695
Yeah

1602
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
There's so much more like

1603
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
We could have turned this

1604
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
CenturyLink

1605
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:31,935
6 hour episode about maybe there might be a behind the bastards

1606
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Completely overlap

1607
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
Ridiculous

1608
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,639
There are no

1609
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,175
Protections in place

1610
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,455
Because

1611
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Everybody kind of just

1612
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,271
Assumes that

1613
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,575
Well we won't elect a psychopath

1614
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:55,231
Where we can all just go like na na na

1615
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:01,631
Redo

1616
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,703
It's about David Clarke in the deputy sheriff's Association

1617
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
They voted like

1618
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
If something

1619
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,567
I don't remember voting

1620
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,383
Voted for him

1621
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:23,135
Like this guy give you 77 G

1622
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,463
Discretionary

1623
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
It came out of the

1624
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,791
The money that you have gone back into the

1625
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,119
The department

1626
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Alex

1627
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
If you knew anything about the

1628
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,239
2

1629
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
Taking a lot of money

1630
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,311
Just take from the citizen

1631
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
What's up with that

1632
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:48,735
God you are philosophically in line with what I believe is love

1633
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Yeah

1634
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,879
So many people who wrote our laws and everything

1635
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,695
People who

1636
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
Good live

1637
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
A better life

1638
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
They just forget that

1639
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,815
Anytime you want a psychopath could show up a

1640
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:06,143
Trick people into

1641
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,471
Alex

1642
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
The show

1643
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
4 something

1644
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,567
He is absolutely not

1645
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,912
As long as I get my money

1646
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,008
Alex had a

1647
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
Yeah I mean

1648
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,616
But Jenny payment probably had

1649
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:52,992
He was just crazy small town

1650
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,856
Because Joe Arpaio David Clarke have particularly flamboyant

1651
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,672
That doesn't mean that all of these Sheriff's have gone

1652
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,024
Yeah they just don't have the Opera

1653
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,352
Maybe they happen to be replaced

1654
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,144
Where there is better oversight

1655
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
Of what they're doing

1656
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,472
The circumstances warrant such

1657
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
That happened

1658
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Possibly

1659
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,616
Not

1660
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
Unreal

1661
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
He's a piece

1662
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Off

1663
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:27,808
God

1664
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,648
Her interview is just about like it

1665
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:35,744
You bet they are

1666
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
With him

1667
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,352
Clark to say that he would follow the oath

1668
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:46,752
Keeper Mountain

1669
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Framing

1670
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
Trying to get like a

1671
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Promise from him

1672
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,384
That he will not go along with

1673
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,944
Kind of confiscation of guns whatsoever

1674
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,736
Andover County

1675
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,784
Exactly

1676
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,880
In such a way as to be like

1677
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,952
Tomorrow I can report

1678
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,328
He's on board with our booth

1679
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,376
Dwight Clark

1680
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Answers this question

1681
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,192
In about why he would never get

1682
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,728
Involved with gun confiscation

1683
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
Call firearm

1684
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
And make some tournament

1685
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Ford

1686
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
Something

1687
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
That magnitude

1688
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:46,656
You would see the second coming of an American Revolution

1689
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,704
Like you to the likes of which

1690
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,520
Makeup Revolution

1691
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
Feel like a parrot that's

1692
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:58,176
His reasoning isn't so much that like hey it's the wrong thing to do

1693
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:04,576
Killed if I did that recognition in his reasoning that like

1694
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
If I did that

1695
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,184
People would kill me

1696
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,048
The definition of Terror

1697
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,448
Clark's support

1698
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,776
Not taking guns are not regulating or anything like that

1699
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,080
Assume that he was a sheriff who did believe

1700
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:31,200
That may be some sort of Regulation gun registration would be inappropriate thing

1701
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,248
He might have the same position

1702
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,552
But if I did

1703
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
Yeah is that circumstance

1704
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,392
His ability to it

1705
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,440
Express his political belief is being

1706
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
You terrorize

1707
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,048
By a group of people who has made it very clear that if you do anything like this

1708
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
We will kill every cop in America

1709
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
Terrorist

1710
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,960
Alex isn't gopb

1711
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,568
Yeah

1712
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:04,224
This inspirational terrorism

1713
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
Oregon climate bill

1714
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,320
This ride is

1715
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,136
Literal threat of murder has

1716
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
Perfect yeah

1717
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
It's been having an effect

1718
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,720
4 years

1719
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,536
And when you see the sort of thing on Alex's show on 23rd

1720
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
You realize that like

1721
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,632
There's a pretty good indication to

1722
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,912
Meet they know what they're doing

1723
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,008
It's intentional using fret

1724
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Tacit

1725
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Implied

1726
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,080
Threat

1727
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,640
Whatever whatever shape it might take on any given day

1728
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,432
As a means of furthering their

1729
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,712
Political ideology

1730
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
And that

1731
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
My friend

1732
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
Is the definition

1733
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,344
It's a win-win

1734
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,368
Because

1735
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
They can get

1736
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,440
More and more

1737
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Aggressive in Irvine

1738
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,280
Threat

1739
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Org

1740
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,032
Their free speech being violated

1741
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,616
To engage in this verbal terrorism

1742
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,968
I don't know how intentional it is but it's a good song

1743
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,784
If you if you have no ethics

1744
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,112
The fact that you're destroying Society

1745
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,904
If you don't care about those sorts of things

1746
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
Pretty good Hustle

1747
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,488
Yeah yeah yeah

1748
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,584
It really Banks hard on them

1749
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,376
Believing that the world is going to

1750
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
Before any kind of karma

1751
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,984
Before there's any kind of comeuppance

1752
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,008
Further action

1753
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
David Clarke

1754
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,384
Is discussing how the last

1755
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
Serious about

1756
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
Reduction

1757
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,976
The argument it like all their gun control measures all of the

1758
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Gun control

1759
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,560
It's not about violence

1760
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,120
Because if they were serious about violence

1761
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
Production

1762
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
They get behind

1763
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,192
Him and the initiative

1764
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
And

1765
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,528
Join me Armin Armin calling for longer

1766
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,576
Incarceration

1767
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,368
For repeat career Criminal

1768
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:24,000
Who has demonstrated over and over again if they get a handgun they're going to get a firearm

1769
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,424
The only way to Clark what do you think

1770
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,032
Any sense here is if you was doing that what he means is that he wants to reduce crime by law

1771
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,312
People up forever

1772
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,896
That's the only way you could realistically be advocating for longer sentence

1773
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,808
Repeat criminals from re-offending

1774
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
Expect to get caught

1775
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
They do not

1776
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,512
General Behavior option of

1777
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,792
Describe doesn't go well

1778
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,840
They're generally an optimistic bunch

1779
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
In this

1780
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,448
The consistent finding is that the severity of a pun

1781
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,496
Determinate of value

1782
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
In terms of it being a dick

1783
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,080
But what does

1784
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
Is this a crime would be very low if we lived in an authoritarian because the odds of getting away with a crime

1785
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
Will be very slim

1786
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,088
But that's not the kind of world any of us want to live in

1787
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
Alex is already voice

1788
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,952
Strong support for Clark

1789
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,744
Which should be picked up for

1790
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
Surprise

1791
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,632
Dear Clark expressing another position that is a direct opposition

1792
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:38,752
Longer prison sentences don't do anything to help lower crime but you know what they

1793
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,080
They drastically raise the prison population

1794
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
Dancing project using information from the national research

1795
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,760
Cancel half of the rise in prison population that occur between

1796
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
80 and 2010

1797
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
Was attributable to the growing Obsession in our country

1798
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
He was given criminals long

1799
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,904
Prison sentences

1800
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,720
So politicians could posture like their tough-on-crime

1801
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,256
Super-predator

1802
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,536
I mean that

1803
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,840
That's why we have a much larger prison population

1804
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,424
Mandatory minimums

1805
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,216
And it was a bipartisan affair

1806
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:15,616
Prison sentences

1807
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,664
Single variable calculation

1808
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,712
And that variable has to be red

1809
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
He wants to

1810
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,272
To be the one punished

1811
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
He's trying to trick you into

1812
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,368
He's doing it for your benefit

1813
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,160
Longer harsher sentence

1814
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,184
Do not deter for

1815
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,488
First-time criminals because they don't expect to get caught

1816
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
They don't deter

1817
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,304
Repeat criminals for the same reason

1818
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
Think about it for one f****** sex

1819
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,424
If you're in the mindset where you're going to commit a robbery

1820
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
Do you think there's a single bit of do

1821
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,544
Between 20 and 30 years in prison be possible

1822
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,592
If you get caught

1823
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
If you're okay with

1824
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
20 the other

1825
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,664
What time is it going to swing you back to

1826
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,432
Your senses

1827
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
That's complete nonsense

1828
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,016
If you just talked about lock

1829
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,296
People open till

1830
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,088
Or until they're cooked to

1831
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,904
Insanely cruel

1832
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,720
Gable end up balloon in the cost of incarceration pass

1833
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,280
Disappointed Society could probably carry

1834
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,096
As people get older the health-related costs

1835
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
They have go up

1836
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,936
And that rises even higher in prison population

1837
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:15,776
The cost of incarcerating people who are reaching the ages where many of them have

1838
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
Medical

1839
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,104
Dumb idea Society

1840
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,664
Especially considering all you would be doing is

1841
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,968
Buddy that could be better used on initiative

1842
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
And programs that work to solve the problems that

1843
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
The crime

1844
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,088
The clerk doesn't want

1845
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
Crime

1846
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:30,880
He wants

1847
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
More punished

1848
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
That is an important distinction

1849
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,488
In this monster of a he

1850
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
That's why I what

1851
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,584
Norway or Sweden

1852
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,608
That has the lowest

1853
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,424
Recidivism rates yeah and their prisons are

1854
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,448
Well

1855
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:49,824
Who like three times lower

1856
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,360
What is the difference between

1857
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
20 + 30

1858
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,408
And you can leave

1859
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
Intellect

1860
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,880
We're learning

1861
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:06,464
From the mistakes that we made as Society

1862
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,912
I think we're learning terms of the scholarship

1863
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
That we have

1864
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,616
Weather Society decides to implement

1865
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
Is a completely different Quest

1866
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,992
People like

1867
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,272
It doesn't seem like we're going to

1868
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,552
And people like Alex Jones

1869
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,856
Can spit weaponized illiteracy that

1870
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
Fights against

1871
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
People who

1872
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,416
Study and research

1873
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:42,816
Just want to make it

1874
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,096
Clear all the rest

1875
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,376
The stuff that I cut out is just

1876
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,656
Guns are cool

1877
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,832
We need more like

1878
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:11,488
So after you still riding High interview

1879
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,048
I guess I kind of agree with him

1880
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,656
I will not be involved

1881
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,192
Did Gunn

1882
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,240
Consultation at all

1883
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,520
Which helps

1884
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:26,336
High-profile

1885
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,872
Our Squad

1886
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,896
Zoe's Pizza

1887
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:47,328
Someone who looks weird

1888
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,936
She's not radical

1889
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216
Everyone's gotten radical

1890
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,544
He's not far off from what America was originally

1891
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:01,664
He's a lot farther off from our ideals of what we were base

1892
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,760
In terms of actual historical

1893
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
You know

1894
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,064
Existence

1895
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:14,208
I think Alex is always wrong

1896
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,488
Thomas Jefferson

1897
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:21,888
If you want about the founding of the country

1898
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:28,288
Very interesting directions

1899
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
Restrains

1900
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,720
Present

1901
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Really

1902
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,304
So Jordan really he said firearms

1903
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,632
Again

1904
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,656
I want you to guess

1905
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Is this

1906
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
A real Club

1907
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:06,432
Easiest trivia game Overworld this is not a real quote

1908
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:10,528
George Washington quotes

1909
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:15,904
George Washington was said to have said the following in a dress

1910
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
The Congress

1911
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,000
Completely made up quotes

1912
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,072
Important

1913
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:23,840
To the Constitution

1914
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,704
Keystone under Independence

1915
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
The church

1916
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
The plow the Prairie wagon

1917
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,568
Citizens Firearms are indelibly related

1918
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:37,920
From the hour the pilgrims landed to the present day events occurrences attendance

1919
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,736
Proof security and happiness

1920
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:43,040
The Rifle and Pistol are equally indispensable

1921
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,368
The very atmosphere of firearms everywhere restrained

1922
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
Evil interference

1923
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,720
They deserve a place of honor with all that's good

1924
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,328
It's important to remember George Washington was kind of

1925
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:01,728
Machete speaker and a city writer

1926
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:06,848
Very serious tip-off like the pros

1927
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:10,944
Is very unlike the waves boat

1928
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,968
Most likely

1929
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,504
This is the consent

1930
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,880
26 by PewDiePie

1931
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,696
My cousin called

1932
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,512
But we never tried to pass that off as a quote

1933
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
Fort Washington

1934
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
The interpretation

1935
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,144
Contempo isn't intentional misreading of his opinion

1936
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
He's talking about

1937
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,496
Washington address

1938
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,776
And then that paragraph is

1939
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
But it's not a quote

1940
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:38,592
.

1941
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,128
Is presented as Washington

1942
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,200
Words rhyme with mist

1943
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:43,968
From

1944
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:46,016
His editorial article in

1945
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,832
Hunter Trader Trapper permit

1946
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,904
Time

1947
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
Confederate Southwest

1948
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,488
Is really working hard to Rebrand

1949
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,048
I don't know how to do anything about CS

1950
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,328
So I don't I don't

1951
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,864
I don't know what his intentions

1952
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,216
Whatever until it doesn't

1953
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,008
Seemed like he was trying to run

1954
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:10,848
Yeah it seems like those are his words he's feeling

1955
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,920
Which is why this is interesting because those are not washing

1956
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,456
Or Jefferson's words

1957
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:19,040
They RCS wheatley's feelings about the history of God

1958
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
Which would not have

1959
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,344
Nearly as much

1960
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Avatar

1961
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
We're Alex to quote this correct

1962
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,000
Give a quote that anybody

1963
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,328
You should be able to tell

1964
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,632
And that is his intention of prairie wagon

1965
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,704
Hooter certainly not something that would have been relevant today

1966
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,472
Lifetime

1967
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,520
Seeing as the french-owned the Great Plains

1968
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
And I Washington would be

1969
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,592
Be dead before the Louisiana Purchase

1970
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:46,432
Also in Washington's lifetime for uses the word pilgrim

1971
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
To describe the first

1972
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,504
Call mr. K mobile

1973
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
That terminology

1974
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,832
She didn't become popular until the early 80s

1975
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
Assertive indications

1976
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Red Sox

1977
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
Comply

1978
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,744
Over the years this has passed around

1979
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,816
Picked up the most traction was being a big

1980
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,120
Piece of rhetoric put out by the militia of Mont

1981
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
DJ balloons book

1982
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,264
American extremism history politics of abolition movement

1983
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,592
Not only does the militia of Montana's employment

1984
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:17,152
These founding fathers typify the malicious argument

1985
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Respect of the second

1986
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,224
And the importance of

1987
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,808
It also provides another telling illustration

1988
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,832
Can of the extent

1989
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,928
The militia stick to identify themselves with the tradition of America

1990
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
History

1991
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,024
The militia of Montana's desire to receive the approbation

1992
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
These founders

1993
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,144
Steven Lee overwhelms the demands of historical Act

1994
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,936
Madison's words

1995
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,472
The Federalist 46

1996
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
Are compressed

1997
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,520
Misquoted slightly

1998
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,056
And those attributed to Washington

1999
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
And Jefferson are simply invented

2000
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,664
Malloy goes on to make a really good

2001
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,456
There a lot of quotes

2002
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,736
Melissa folks

2003
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,528
It's from this time. They're real

2004
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:57,600
Some people like Richard Henry Lee or George Mason

2005
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Patrick Henry

2006
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,184
But what all those dudes have in common

2007
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,720
The people like George

2008
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,000
Container Thomas Jefferson

2009
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,024
Hooter

2010
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,072
Absolutely makeup quotes for don't

2011
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Do you know what the difference is

2012
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Washington and Jeff

2013
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Person knew how to read

2014
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
No

2015
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,776
The people who the militia community

2016
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
Quote accurately

2017
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,616
Are pretty much all anti-federalist

2018
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,152
Order put simply

2019
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,200
They were the people back in the late 7th

2020
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,760
Hundred who are opposed to the ratification of

2021
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
Constitution

2022
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,392
Federalist are really who the militia people are most

2023
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,696
But they're largely not seen as the founders of

2024
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:36,000
Country by most people have a basic view the route

2025
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
America

2026
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
People like James Madison

2027
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,328
Alexander Hamilton

2028
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,888
Benjamin Franklin George Washington

2029
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
People associate with the country

2030
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
And they were all federal

2031
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:51,872
So in order to associate themselves with the rightful lineage of the country's founding

2032
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
These Patriot militia Folk

2033
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,688
Make-up quotes

2034
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
To Federal

2035
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,320
If I had to guess I would say that Alex's

2036
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,856
Constant misquoting of Jefferson

2037
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,720
To attach himself

2038
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
Federalist Legacy

2039
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,144
Or him being so dumb but he's just been fooled by militia websites and newsletters he read growing up that we're doing

2040
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
Exactly that

2041
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,752
So I think that's probably a pretty good explanation

2042
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
4y out

2043
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
Constantly

2044
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,104
Yelling fake quotes from Thomas

2045
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Literally nobody

2046
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:30,528
The United States more than the people who profess to love the United

2047
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,576
I think you could

2048
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,880
Didn't want the United States

2049
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:37,952
United States

2050
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,512
Federalist 10

2051
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
Centralized

2052
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Government

2053
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,888
I believe that president was just a replacement

2054
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
Yeah

2055
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,264
Federalist you probably wouldn't have ended up with the Bill of Rights

2056
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Weary

2057
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,224
Much more closely

2058
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
Mirror

2059
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,528
The militia movement

2060
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
People

2061
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:06,624
Right

2062
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,184
To be like we are like these people who were against

2063
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Constitution

2064
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,256
They don't want to beat they don't want

2065
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,304
Create a fictitious

2066
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
With the people who were

2067
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,144
Founders Inn

2068
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,728
Rata fires of the Constitution that they idolize in Spanish

2069
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,544
Itsjerian

2070
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,128
And that's why all of Alex's information

2071
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,456
Have to go back to go back to him

2072
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,736
No absolutely

2073
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,296
Cuz otherwise he's completely disconnected from the lineage

2074
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
Sound

2075
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
Anyway

2076
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,928
Just for fun though here's a real quote for you from walking

2077
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,976
In the Revolutionary War Washington

2078
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:45,536
Inside the militias were quote worse than useless

2079
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:50,912
He wrote to Congress and quote they come in

2080
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,192
You can't tell where

2081
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,496
They consume your Provisions exhaust your stores

2082
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,056
At Last At the critical moment

2083
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,848
Washington was not until

2084
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:04,224
Thought they sucked and they needed a former Governor former Army

2085
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:11,392
Sew-ins Xscape we get back to

2086
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
After Clark

2087
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:18,560
It's back to complain about how the meteorologist

2088
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:24,960
I'll just saying that I said all this s*** I didn't say

2089
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,728
Didn't say that I said

2090
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
I'm telling you that they

2091
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,056
It's a bad who's on first

2092
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:33,664
Additional irony

2093
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,856
Outside the asteroid belt

2094
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,296
Empire Strikes Back

2095
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,392
Oh my gosh look at

2096
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,328
Like my wife

2097
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,448
Wow

2098
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,472
The one piece

2099
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:34,592
Covering

2100
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,896
Meteor that blew up over Russia

2101
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
He's insisting

2102
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
Incorrect

2103
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:40,992
He said it was

2104
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:41,760
The secret Lisa

2105
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,296
Some sort of an attack on Russia

2106
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,088
Very upset

2107
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,624
Don't cover how accurately

2108
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,184
He actually has about stuff like

2109
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,608
Flew over Russia was a spur

2110
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
Off of da14

2111
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,680
Or was related to

2112
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
But that itself is

2113
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
Shity reporting that Alex should be

2114
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,288
Be criticized

2115
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,104
I prefer to call it the 14th of

2116
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:12,224
Da14 was making its closest pass to Earth that day

2117
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,576
This meteor exploded 12 miles above ground

2118
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:19,392
Very irresponsible reporter

2119
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
Conclude the related

2120
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:26,560
It's to space things happening on the same days must be connected let's go to lunch

2121
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:34,240
All credible astronomers the Russian meteor Chelyabinsk

2122
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:36,032
I had completely different orbits

2123
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,568
Nothing to do with each other

2124
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,104
To quote NASA's jet

2125
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,896
Propulsion Laboratory

2126
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:44,480
Not associated with asteroid 2012 da14

2127
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:48,320
I which made a very close flyby of Earth just 16 hours later

2128
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,624
This is because the two objects approached

2129
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,416
The Earth from completely different direction

2130
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,976
Entirely different orbits around the Sun

2131
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,512
And their compositions are

2132
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,584
The time of their arrival was certainly heads

2133
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:03,424
F****** big universe out there and crazy

2134
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
And sometimes do happen

2135
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,544
Caught everyone off guard

2136
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,336
Because it was below the threshold size

2137
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:13,152
Four bodies that are monitored by the International Space Age

2138
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,712
That's why I came out of nowhere

2139
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
Which actor

2140
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Start a conversation

2141
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,112
We need to start monitoring smaller ship

2142
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:28,512
Near-earth objects could f*** us up pretty quickly smaller even if they're smaller it wasn't at all the criticism

2143
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,536
Was being made by

2144
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:33,632
Mainstream media but Alex absolutely deserves

2145
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,168
We're at all

2146
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,704
Because the claim

2147
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,984
The connected isn't just

2148
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,032
Service light in Acura CL

2149
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,056
Nothing

2150
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,848
It's part of the dangerous Broderick

2151
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,408
Isn't reality

2152
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
Coming from Alec

2153
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:51,040
Meteor was a piece of

2154
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:51,808
Is Metro

2155
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,368
Can't trust any expert

2156
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,720
They told you

2157
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,280
But how do you know how about you tell that to

2158
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,072
Thousand or so people in Russia

2159
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,608
Injured by Chelyabinsk

2160
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
What appears to be just a simp

2161
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,008
Instance of Alex being wrong is actually a functional

2162
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
Pizza

2163
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:15,104
Which is built on a misunderstanding

2164
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,640
Or just an outright lie

2165
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,456
What they weren't

2166
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,296
It's easy to gloss over this as just like you know he's just

2167
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,856
Which is what they did

2168
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
And I think I

2169
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,952
Did the first time but I heard them talking about it

2170
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,768
But it's it's

2171
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
It's more than a fairy

2172
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,888
If there's there's so much like

2173
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:40,448
Even the stuff that should be a disadvantage

2174
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,496
If you don't have any shame

2175
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,544
Turns out to be an advance

2176
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,848
You know like you should

2177
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
You should

2178
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,896
Feel embarrassed

2179
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:51,200
If you are dunked on that hard

2180
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,480
Shity

2181
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,272
Instead of just

2182
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
Doubling the fuckdown

2183
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,112
I'm the best there ever was

2184
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:02,720
Because I also was a true

2185
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:07,584
And so then you take that inability to feel shame or take any responsibility for

2186
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:11,168
And turn that into the media that is

2187
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,704
Trying to get you to feel those

2188
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
Spell

2189
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,056
Listen to

2190
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,136
The slippery slope there is real

2191
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,160
Bucked up

2192
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:36,512
Here and just end things on a sort of

2193
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,560
Please God tell me it's a good thing

2194
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
Not good but it's not bad parsley palate cleanser

2195
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:48,032
This is the literal end of the episode where Alex

2196
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,824
Does taking a call from a guy listen

2197
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,104
Inside info

2198
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
About

2199
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
Barack

2200
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,736
Someone in my family is in heat

2201
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,808
Received the medal from Obama

2202
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:06,208
He said that Obama refused to look at any of them in the eyes

2203
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,000
He would look in the shoulder

2204
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,560
Wife of Woodruff contact with them

2205
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,912
He had a

2206
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:18,752
Handshake muscle nothing to it you know

2207
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,552
The icon

2208
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,344
Most

2209
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,904
Interested in this clip

2210
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:36,928
Fake laugh

2211
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:39,232
There's the first part of the fake laugh

2212
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,536
Hahaha

2213
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,072
Focus on that

2214
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:51,776
That's creepy and weird but also like

2215
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,568
What do you think he's holding back

2216
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:58,944
Like you see just not formulated his Obama smells like sulfur yet he's just not

2217
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,968
Figured out what

2218
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,760
To do like what is

2219
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,296
Pretending he knows

2220
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,320
Uno's

2221
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,648
For a fact that I'm his inside sources that Obama

2222
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,208
Has been aggressively average dick

2223
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,536
Okay I really an insult

2224
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:19,168
Or is the danger Breitbart unimpressive Vols unremarkable.

2225
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,728
I mean like this color is like

2226
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:26,848
Really think he's going to get some mileage out of like he's Olympic

2227
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,640
Grill grate

2228
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
Free upgrade

2229
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:32,992
It's pretty pointless

2230
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:39,392
Do you remember when people used to be like I heard of has a limp handshake

2231
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,160
Instead of

2232
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,440
22 People's Credit

2233
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,768
I think it's fine

2234
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,816
It's a it is a deterioration

2235
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,632
Little better by slide

2236
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,168
Did George W bush

2237
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
When I was in college

2238
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,752
Around that time

2239
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
Sure

2240
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,544
That's that's

2241
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,824
I am not

2242
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,616
Too far away from you

2243
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:03,968
Uh-oh

2244
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
I

2245
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,296
What I'm getting at is I hated that dude

2246
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,320
He was the word

2247
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,368
But if someone came to me

2248
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,904
And was like he has a limp

2249
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
That wouldn't right

2250
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
It wouldn't register

2251
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:20,352
Radio show where I talked about how Bush was terrible all the time

2252
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:24,448

01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:34,688
Have the right to waste my time with even if I'm just about to end the show now I'm extending the show

2255
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,344

Public Disgrace to meet out

2258
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
Yeah because you don't want it

2259
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,024
Encourage that sort of behavior in your collars

01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,328
All the sudden do you like now

2261
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096

Bulshit

2264
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,936
Exactly

2265
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
Exactly it's

2266
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,984
Really cheap ins

2267
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,032
Whatever is going on on your show

2268
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,080
Consider you just

2269
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
F****** interview date

2270
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,128
Clark

2271
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,664
You just spit it's it's trash

2272
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,688
The show is trash

2273
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:14,368
But at least it also promotes celebrate

2274
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:16,416
So you know

2275
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,184
Good track

2276
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:23,840
Good work guys interesting leaves

2277
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:30,240
The show full time just so I don't have to deal with it to the present

2278
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:33,312
They lost in space

2279
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,128
Look at this

2280
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,152
It's a real bad

2281
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
Couple days on his show

2282
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,456
Real wild

2283
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,504
The defensiveness Israeli interests

2284
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,296
Really escalating

2285
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,624
Maybe a couple of stories came out

2286
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,648
That mentioned

2287
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,928
Any other Google

2288
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,256

2289
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,024
I'm so aggressive

2290
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,816
I think that might be

2291
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
Something that

2292
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:56,864
Gross

2293
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:01,728
I think that might be I think I might be a very serious friend

2294
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,008
Prestera pay

2295
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:05,568

Constant

2300
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,136
Which feels much more modern

2301
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,000
The navel-gazing

2302
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,536
Self-involvement

2303
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,328
Is very

2304
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,352
Represent

2305
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,632
His present day

2306
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,400
Style

2307
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,448
That's interesting

2308
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,216
I don't know

2309
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:37,312
Yeah it kind of suggested we always knew that

2310
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,592
Statistics Drake by

2311
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,616
As we see it

2312
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,432
Kind of grow into

2313
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:47,808
It's Fab

2314
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
She loves Trump

2315
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:50,112
Yeah and how much he's trying to

2316
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,904
Emulate that behavior of just

2317
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
Complete narcissistic

2318
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,464
Self-aggrandizing

2319
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,536
Yeah you know that

2320
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,816
You don't have any shame

2321
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
Ben

2322
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,912
There you go you turn into whatever it is they begin

2323
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,056
We spent a lot of time

2324
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:09,824
Discussing how

2325
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,896
He won't shut the f****** about going to a morgue

2326
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:19,296
Did you know little about it

2327
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,392
Narcissistic

2328
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,416
Acting out

2329
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,512
But it also has

2330
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:33,632
Appearance of like yeah there's a big show for you to go on and people were

2331
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
Talkin about it

2332
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:39,264
For Better or Worse

2333
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,128
Yeah but

2334
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
Is giving a thumbs up

2335
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:51,296
Or some of that being like hey you just made us all look like you got a crazy ass whole service to euro

2336
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:57,696
Probably because yours is Chill

2337
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:07,168
Whatever it is it still on

2338
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:09,984

How do you narcissism

2340
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,544
As much as this.

2341
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:16,640
Like this Atlantic article him lying about what they're saying

2342
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,200
The stuff about like

2343
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
Fox

2344
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
AP article

2345
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:23,040
About the 1.6

2346
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,112
Those are two things are much

2347
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Lowers

2348
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,648
Scale

2349
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,928
People are not talking

2350
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
About this

2351
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,464
That much

2352
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:34,560
CNN's reliable sources is related to

2353
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:37,376
Reliable sources

2354
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
It's interesting too

2355
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,288
Maybe it's just because of its it's been over this stretch of time

2356
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,336
Here's the way I look

2357
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,712
The requirement

2358
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:55,552
For that which he will obsess about himself

2359
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:56,832
Seems to be

2360
01:52:57,344 --> 01:53:03,488
Wow

2361
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
For the Piers Morgan

2362
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,680
Just like

2363
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,520
Duck store

2364
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
Fear of value list

2365
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
Just do whatever you can

2366
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,616
A PR

2367
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,640
Kind of person

2368
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,688
That's exactly what you would do

2369
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,456
Effective

2370
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,248

01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Defensive

2374
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,160
All

2375
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:34,208
In service of growing

2376
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
Growing his

2377
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
Is sort of

2378
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:37,792
Legend

2379
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Much

2380
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,120
Petty Revenge

2381
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:44,192
Responding to an article that quoted

2382
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,728
One of your writers

2383
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:46,752
Correctly

2384
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,288

It is it's not you that there even talk

2388
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:02,368
I wonder if I guess we'll probably find out sooner than later because if Alex is doing the deposition

2389
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:07,488
Right

2390
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,536

Listen to it that way

2403
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
Really struggling

Overcast

2408
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,312
Not enough Sun
