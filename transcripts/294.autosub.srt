00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,312
Beverages and talk a little bit

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,080
About Alex

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,920
Joan

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
Have you ever played a stripper

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Board game

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
Amazing love this episode

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,632
Vigo County Stratego strategy in the day

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,936
Are you almost here

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
Play Pandora

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Catan like

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,336
I know I don't think I've ever played settlers

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,688
Boys I heard a lot about it about it

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
Cooperative

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:59,392
Cooperative

16
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Board game doesn't involve strategy

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
I really think about it

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
Play Candyland a couple years back then go be funny

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,104
It was boring

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,944
You if it isn't even that I don't think it's just

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Buffets. Lord licorice

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Which is very

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
Too scary for kids

24
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
I don't know man I mean I played I played a bit of risk

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
My day but

26
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
The games like that that I

27
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,216
Chicago comedian he'll have people over to play games

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
I played a number of games that I

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,336
I can't remember the name of that I've enjoyed with him

30
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Like what

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
I've enjoyed that that was a fun game

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
I don't know

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
2/3

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
I'd like to get more into board games

35
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
I would too Alright

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
Hey if you have any recommendations for us know cuz this is a lot about Alex Jones but not a lot about

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
Cool new games

38
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
That is great

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,408
I will be going over

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,992
To find out how

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
Short version to get you up to speed

42
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:36,416
So far weirdly in our last episode covering

43
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
He did get mad at a caller

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,584
Who wanted to say that Robbie Parker one of the parents of one of

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
The children who died

46
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
Sandy Hook

47
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
And responded I'm not going

48
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
You talk about the parents of dead children

49
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Which was a huge plot twist

50
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Bewhy where it goes

51
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040

Thank you so much you are now

63
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
Has a Caribbean black cake

65
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
So much

66
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
These guys

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Click the button

68
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
Also I don't want to disturb

69
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
Turn into two extended

70
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
You can buy

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Shirts up at the top

72
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
I only bring this up

73
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
People who are posting pictures of themselves

74
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
In the shirts it blows my mind people in foreign countries

75
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
Walking around

76
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,351
A shirt for our delmastro blows my mind and it really at

77
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
I don't know

78
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
It's amazing

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
What's that

80
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,919
Let's listen to an out-of-context drop from Today Show

81
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
A little bit a little bit narcissistic Alex

82
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Has a very narrow

83
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
What are you going to eat

84
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
January 15th 23rd

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
A little bit of a

86
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Return

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,959
His rhetoric

88
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
That's it will probably take on

89
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
I wish

90
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Who discovered list

91
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Dangerous

92
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,655
He always says he never tells his writers what to do so that's great

93
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
I sent a lot of

94
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,335
What do you mean by that going to get a lot of reasons

95
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
To impeach a president

96
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
That will

97
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Echo Park

98
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Situation

99
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Would you believe

100
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
That I didn't even

101
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Don't care about that

102
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
He's written his own articles

103
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,071
But for Obama and then posted them on his website

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
And now

105
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Other

106
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,495
Media things are reporting on report has a link

107
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
To Alex's story

108
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Eva link

109
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,639
Articles

110
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,927
The idea of that headline is a bit like Grassroots people are like

111
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Infowars

112
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,303
Writing an article

113
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
That becomes how Alex reports

114
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
The story

115
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
But he has created

116
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Citizens call for Obama's

117
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
Kicking out office

118
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:47,711
When I report on the story that I stopped

119
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
This is

120
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
It is amazing

121
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
Believes that the media and everybody is

122
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
So against

123
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
The founding fathers

124
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
I hate George Washington

125
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Grapes

126
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
But it's never been

127
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
This then

128
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Okay what do we got here

129
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
Programma

130
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,951
Paul Revere

131
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
Foreign occupation Force.

132
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
If that were true

133
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,255
Yeah we hate Paul Revere wouldn't have sailed as a pilot

134
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,143
It didn't get picked up at all

135
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
What is The Chew

136
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Had no idea what he's talking

137
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,335
Mad about

138
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
Read the trades

139
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Is helping

140
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
I got this

141
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
To the comedy game a little bit

142
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,183
But it should tell you like The Depths that he means

143
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
To go to to get out

144
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,303
Television

145
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
Michelle it was a pilot it was getting shots around

146
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Wasn't that a beautiful

147
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Remember when we all used to get mad about

148
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Chose

149
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Brownstone

150
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
And now we're mad about

151
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Crimes

152
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Is the emoluments clause

153
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Right-wing terrorism

154
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
Is it fair to say it's creepy.

155
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Sliding along

156
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Yeah that was a

157
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
More innocent time

158
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
What time is that on this January 5th

159
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
Episode Alex has introduced articles of him

160
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Barackobama

161
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
And then spend

162
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,615
Most of the rest of the beginning of the show

163
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Doing

164
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
A supplement

165
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,967
Infomercial

166
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
So

167
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
That's weird

168
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
Where do they usually go

169
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
What are you going to do if you don't have a gun to defend your supplements

170
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
I will take them

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,247
I thought that was a really weird way to open up for this

172
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Next cut they're coming for you and the supplements

173
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,815
Probably true

174
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,911
Not the order of it but like this

175
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Illegal gun sales

176
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
The first one regulated supplement Market

177
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,591
In terms of like okay let's get rid of dangerous things

178
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Welcome artist

179
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,991
Because

180
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Issue

181
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
In the MoMA

182
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,439
Goodwill regulate the supplemented

183
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Yeah that's

184
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
That I doubt it

185
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
You probably not so

186
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Run

187
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
In the more recent

188
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Daisies

189
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
Which was Private labeling a lot of products that were created by dr. group in the global Healing Center

190
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
No he's not here

191
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
He is a chiropractor

192
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
And Connor

193
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
But before Alex got involved with doctor

194
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,039
He had another sponsor that is this dr. Wallach

195
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Who also is not a.

196
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
After he has Veterinary

197
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:15,743
Beyond

198
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Promote

199
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
He plugs

200
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,607
I've made the point for sat on a boat

201
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Too much but

202
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
He's not human doctor

203
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
He's a veterinarian

204
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,031
From my alma mater University of Missouri

205
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
So I'm pretty sure that means that he's cool enough to give humans

206
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Medical advice

207
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Known as laetrile

208
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Wichita

209
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,207
Doctors who

210
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
Clearance not be used

211
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
There's a considerable risk of serious adverse effects

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
From cyanide

213
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
Atrial especially after oral ingestion

214
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,847
Balance of late Riyal is there for unambitious Lee negative

215
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
The drug is most memorable is one of the things

216
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,783
Steve McQueen tried and is unsuccessful fight against terminal cancer

217
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,855
Only $40,000 a month for laetrile treatments that didn't

218
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
Just a little more

219
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
It doesn't cure

220
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
Along with you sure

221
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,471
Yeah goodnight Nobel Prize which is impossible

222
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
Nobel committee keeps nominees

223
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Confidential

224
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Unless

225
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Mr Abbott says it out loud only other legitimate

226
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Conclusion

227
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
You can come to is that he nominated himself for a Nobel Prize

228
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
In 1995 it was reported

229
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Chelation therapy

230
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
To treat Harkins

231
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
Which is absolutely not an appropriate medical treatment

232
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
A heart condition that's very happy

233
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
No that is

234
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
He got into a little bit of trouble when a family member of one of his patients

235
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,127
Has complained that their relative died after Wallach told him not to go see a normal doctor

236
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Is chelation detox

237
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Proceed with effective

238
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
Chelation therapy for heart disease treatment has been

239
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,111
Condemned by the NIH and quote every scientific medical organization that has reviewed

240
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
A few years prior Bahamut kept on

241
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,303
15 million dollars in Damages

242
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
The family of a patient

243
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,631
Who died in his care is very similar

244
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
Dances with chelation being used to treat heartburn

245
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
It's unclear why while it didn't end up in a

246
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
Similar situation affected wallets victims

247
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,199
Wife never pressed charges and quote is also a disciple of

248
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,247
And Healthcare and had the body cream

249
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Just hated that

250
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Helps

251
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Let's do this

252
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Need to do a quack therapy

253
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
I love it I love it

254
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
3 weeks later

255
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
Entire thing

256
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,495
Deficient

257
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
And they don't know it

258
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
So he's mineral-rich supplements are all manner of illness natural lifespan

259
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,759
They should be living which is 120 to 140 years of age

260
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
Unfortunately quote

261
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
The Centers for Disease Control and prevention in Atlanta Georgia reported the results

262
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
13 year study

263
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
10758 American

264
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,863
Which failed to find any mortality benefits from vitamin and mineral supplements

265
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
The study found that even though supplement users smoke and drink less than non-users eat more fruits and vegetables and non-users

266
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:44,127
Live any longer than

267
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
So

268
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
You can't trust

269
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
Remember how every zombie movie starts with them going down I don't try

270
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Why we have a point

271
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Claims that even though there are these

272
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Stop the show that these are full of crap

273
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,775
Cultures that have lights

274
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Between 128

275
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
40 years

276
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
I don't remember the exact ones but I know the one of them

277
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Quesarito

278
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,719
People live long because they drink when he calls quote glacier milk

279
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Which

280
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
Which is

281
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
Water that's filled of colloidal minerals

282
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
People have looked into these ideas have speculated that he

283
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Address to make

284
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Making this stuff up

285
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
What is a dangerous lunatic

286
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
It is appeal to people is still in line with the Alex Jones at

287
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Khalid suncity

288
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Is early sponsor the show

289
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:01,183
Well explained things to sell his product and they're very similar to what Alex

290
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Hope and resentment

291
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Wala Conference of simplistic

292
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
Completely unproven next

Explanation for everything that ails you

294
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
Everything that's wrong with

00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Your health isn't heaven

296
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
It's all just mineral

297
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
You just gotta buy his pills and you'll be good as new

298
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
False

299
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Hope

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Alex does the same thing with Paulette

301
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
Distilling very complicated situations

302
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Different

303
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Perspectives and

304
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,807
Interest he turns that all into a battle between good guy Patriots

305
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,599
And evil overpowered globalist

306
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Each of them hijacked

307
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
The part of your brain that

308
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Wella koleston harnesses resentment

309
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
The fellas where

310
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
Most people

00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Brookfield

312
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Love the medical field

313
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Almost everyone's heads

314
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,359
Some sort of a bad experience with a doctor or at a clinic or have a loved one who had some sort of a medical copper

315
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Acacia Energy

316
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Suggest your batiks

317
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Periods

318
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
Coincidence

319
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
It was actually the medical establishment

320
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
2 Dumbarton

321
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Even care about treating you

322
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Sounds right

323
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
If only

324
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Listen to dr. Wallach

325
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,279
And giving you his medals then you wouldn't have had that bad experience

326
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Uses that

327
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Happened to People's resent

328
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
For their bags

329
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
In order to convince the

330
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Decide

331
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Alex does the same thing with the

332
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
We all have some

333
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Complaints about the governor

334
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Very natural

335
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Government does a lot of shity things

336
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
The problem is that Alex takes those feelings

337
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Uses them

338
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
The push people towards his own goal

339
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,087
As opposed to allowing them to fuel their disappointment and resentment towards the government

340
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,671
I let that grow into whatever form of Civic action they feel is appropriate

341
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,767
Again is a hijacking of normal fairly Universal feeling

342
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
For exploitative purpose

343
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
So

344
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,703
It makes total sense it easier on Alex's show doing this

345
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,055
It's weird that it takes up so much of the show though

346
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Scituate

347
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383

Dr. Mario guy is dr. Robotnik with his mean

351
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695

00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
Tuesday skills

385
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
Anything like that

386
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
Vig

387
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,048
You can play 10 years longer than normal because of it

388
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
He played for

389
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
15

390
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Isn't just 5c

391
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,688
You know

392
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
And then the rest

393
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Are part of the practice

394
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
So if you're

395
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Not

396
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,064
Moving along in your

397
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Career you wind up

398
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
Only play

399
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,744
But a lot of it doesn't come down to like physical deterioration

400
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Select amount of spots

401
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,656
It's Bora Talent Gap than it is a like everyone's body breaks down

402
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
From listening to this interview which were not going to

403
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
280

404
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
Stuff because I don't

405
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
But also because

406
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
His main point

407
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,064
It may be that he got surgery and then also started

408
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Wallach's

409
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,744
Whatever benefits he gain from having a

410
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,352
Successful hip surgery

411
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Correlation

412
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Absolutely

413
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,312
I also found this

414
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
Which made me not want to

415
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Nope

416
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Have a great

417
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
And I thank you for all that

418
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
Theo Ratliff made for

419
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,280
It is

420
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,144
Play multi-level marketing company had a conference in Las Vegas

421
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Any recorded message

422
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
People who got

423
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,336
EasyPay representative of

424
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
Is basically just like

425
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
Here's one of our celebrity

426
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
Yeah exactly

427
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,648
Is this is just a shameful display

428
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
Whatever

429
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
It's probably

430
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
A little bit less ethical than just like whatever

431
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,960
Just because he's luring people into a multi-level marketing

432
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Disclose that

433
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Associated

434
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Youngevity

435
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
Just that he loves the product

436
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Into the indication

437
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Representative

438
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
I told you earlier

439
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Our friend dr. Joel Wallach

440
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
It's not at so much a human doctor

441
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,376
Is he is a veterinarian

442
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,168
And that could be a problem

443
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
For most people

444
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,568
Well they're not supposed to have practice or give medical advice

445
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
People lose their licenses

446
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Alex

447
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,968
Knows that if you look into him too much you'll find out that he's a veterinarian

448
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
So he has a rebuttal for that yeah

449
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,624
Termite.

450
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
You get better doctoring

451
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
From veterinarian

452
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
If you let me see if you followed this

453
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
You got the gears turning

454
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,544
Looking into this right

455
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
I've written down a little bit

456
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
So if I understand correctly

457
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,968
No better medals

458
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,272
Because their job

459
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
To get beef

460
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
From one place to another

461
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Because of that

462
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
They won't mess with

463
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Industry

464
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
I think yeah I made on a simplistic level yes but doctors don't care if they kill you because

465
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Cuz you can't

466
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
Bear Market isn't predicated upon

467
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Beef

468
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Yes

469
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
Do cows die that is

470
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Negative

471
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,200
To the beef Market

472
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
No

473
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
No I don't

474
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
I think he was working at a

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
Zoo at some point

476
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
Serta telling of his life

477
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Every time that he was at

478
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Just like

479
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Cease on animals

480
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,824
12-year span he claimed

481
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Thousand.

482
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,736
Wow you was working a real crave

483
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
Play making it up

484
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Smite update

485
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
To do it that uses that is like soda

486
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Defense

487
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
For his argument

488
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Cause it's really just a mineral deficiency

489
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
1820 he's a mess

490
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Man stealing

491
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Stealing bodies

492
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Did you watch

493
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Dr. Wallach

494
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Is Bucking

495
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
Crazy

496
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
But

497
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
There's

498
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,280
That is

499
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Alex has been taking the

500
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Beyond Tangy Tangerine

501
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
Other ones whose names I can't remember

502
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
Is catchy

503
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
What's that stuff that you sprinkle into water and it becomes Crystal Light Crystal Light

504
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,880
Crystal Light the bunch of rocks

505
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
Delicious give me some mineral supplement getting really Agro

506
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,864
To ask dr. Wallach

507
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,424
Why is it that I take your supplements

508
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
And I'll be getting aggressive

509
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,568
I've been turning into like I've been angry

510
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,872
And turn it into this world

511
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,944
Detox a couple times

512
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
Here is Wallach

513
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
Turn that question

514
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
Because

515
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Your testicles Alex

516
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,968
Essential nutrients to make testosterone

517
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,648
Enough testosterone make an elephant happy

518
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
Give your body what it means

519
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,216
Can you make a note

520
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
Is becoming a man's man

521
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
Because

522
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
His balls are working

523
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
I don't like

524
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Definition of

525
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
I think it's bad

526
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
I don't like it at all

527
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
I don't answer that's not a good

528
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
None of that was good

529
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
All of the things that

530
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,304
He said we're back

531
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
426 eggs

532
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Maybe two

533
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592
What did you see they did a Fox News

534
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
In front of

535
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Just like a dive

536
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,296
And in front of every

537
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Is apparently put

538
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
10 eggs

539
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,608
Just every single one they just rotated 10 did not every once and I don't know I don't understand what the point was

540
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
What's the point

541
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Nobody could

542
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Oh

543
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,616
Is it just sloppy

544
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay

545
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
He's in front of

546
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Everybody while you're interviewing a very weird

547
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,792
It's entirely possible

548
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
Dee's wolf

549
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
House of headaches

550
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
It's entirely possible

551
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,520
Is that a restaurant doesn't

552
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
I wanted to say and that is

553
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Pitstop fresh

554
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
George on our first episode we ever did

555
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,064
Tell us that it's a takeout Netanyahu

556
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,416
It's all over.

557
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
In the intervening

558
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Two-and-a-half years almost now

559
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,120
We've never heard him explicitly tell us another time

560
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,960
Depressed

561
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
That's the sound I feel like I should make just

562
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
He was a little bit more confident this time then end up going into a prayer

563
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,400
That we weren't satisfied.

564
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
I want to hear that prayer

565
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
The guns

566
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,032
Guns going to be taken with it's time to pray

567
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,504
Because the largely boss of the show is that dr. Wallach

568
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
Song for his

569
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Vertical

570
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,624
Going on here

571
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,696
The story doesn't evolve far past

572
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
I have decided

573
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,328
That I'm going to put In Articles of impeachment

574
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,192
Well he crows a whole lot about the idea that the founding fathers set up the government

575
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
In such a way that citizens

576
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,032
Write the articles of impeachment that the

577
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:49,664
Politicians can pick them up and run with them

578
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,248
I don't want to look into that if you want to believe that

579
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,856
I wouldn't want it not to work that way

580
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
60

581
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
13

582
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,864
Barack Obama has brexit

583
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
Where are you

584
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Around him

585
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
He discusses

586
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
Common Sense gun

587
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Reform

588
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
That you would like to push

589
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Through

590
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Like to work on

591
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,808
Alex plays better the press conference

592
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
She kept stopping

593
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Did you can't even hear it over him

594
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
Being combative and yellow

595
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Seems like there's some

596
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,384
Coded language

597
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Urban

598
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
Pause

599
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,488
The speech to get a little bit of yellow

600
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,840
Whatever

601
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
Very thrilled

602
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
During that press

603
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
And I think this to Alex

604
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
Hardly stop smiling

605
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Fine

606
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Characterization

607
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
People in the real

608
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
Yeah that was what you would want to

609
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
Part right

610
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:59,968
I question whether when you think the real talking about like maybe Drudge

611
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Fox News in that

612
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
I don't even think he likes Fox News

613
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
To pick this up at like 8 and PR New York Times

614
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,304
Whatever

615
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,400
His analysis of this is largely just Obama and Biden

616
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
Can't wait to get their hands on the gun

617
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,032
Are using these kids as a human shield

618
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,824
And

619
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Pretty gross

620
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,944
Really cover a whole lot of it

621
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
Because it's happening

622
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:35,808
As he's doing the show

623
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Deposits

624
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
I think maybe the producers stepped in and already huge

625
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
You just realize themselves

626
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:54,752
We could have cut Clips I can talk about this later let's not do this as a tactic yarn

627
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
Battle against the globalist

628
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,712
Richard said I didn't have anything planned other than

629
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,760
This is a pretty crazy thought

630
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
Around

631
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,240
Yes I want that

632
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
No one's making you

633
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:36,736
Greenlight that was terrible

634
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
I guess

635
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
Alex

636
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,392
Thinking about that day Alex

637
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,464
Alex's Sunday shows are such trash

638
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,328
Why not just do that they're Alex runs operation

639
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
K*** he has

640
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,144
Literally own limits

641
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
You can do whatever you want

642
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:03,360
It would be pretty amazing cuz even try to be Johnny Carson and then he would go

643
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:11,296
Here's how we're going to tie this knot right now and start a fire only f****** comedian who would come on his show is f******

644
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Nick DiPaolo

645
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,072
Roanoke Regular Show Monday through Friday

646
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,216
He's never going to get that up that's the cash cow

647
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Alex Jones as Johnny Carson

648
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
What that show now

649
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
If we could turn this country around

650
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,272
You got to look forward to

651
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
Country rap

652
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Yeah

653
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,024
Rambling and talking freely

654
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Expressing something that I find variance

655
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
To live in a polite Society

656
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
Good

657
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
SunTrust

658
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
We should all aspire

659
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
In peace

660
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,784
Happiness

661
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
Why his version of it is really problematic

662
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,232
To this clip its follow his train of thought

663
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
And how politeness is achieved

664
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
You're going to call you

665
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Okay

666
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
Text

667
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Is

668
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Using camo

669
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,512
Expressing their reason ideas politeness is really only achieved by the

670
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,352
Threat of mortal violence

671
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
I don't want to live in that world

672
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Compton

673
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
Everything you do is predicated on your fear of somebody

674
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:54,368
You might have to

675
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,232
Yeah I would rather live in a world

676
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Where

677
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,560
People recognize that it's a much more pleasant

678
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Be nice to people

679
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,936
And you enjoy your life a lot more when people are nice

680
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
Can you can

681
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,288
Just sort of I don't know externalize that and

682
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,104
Apply that to other people's feelings and realized

683
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,432
If it makes you feel good probably makes them feel good

684
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
Why not

685
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
In a very polite

686
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
Happy place

687
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,232
I can hear a happy elephant amount of testosterone

688
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Yes lot of eggs

689
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
I don't know

690
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Accidentally

691
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
Accidentally

692
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
Express

693
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Describing is

694
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
Hopie and state that I would

695
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Never one

696
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Using to justify it has

697
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,200
Zero resemblance to what he thinks it

698
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
Is what he said

699
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
No

700
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
Nothing to do with

701
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Polite

702
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,112
Lake Society

703
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Medieval Times

704
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Nope

705
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,768
Feelings

706
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Text Johnny Carson watch

707
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,168
Globalist taken care of

708
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:17,568
Magnanimous

709
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Coming up Alex

710
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Some people

711
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,144
Hardcore

712
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,559
I'm talking about

713
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
I could even argue right now that's

714
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,311
I don't think clothing dictates your fascism level

715
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,455
I think this is so fascinating

716
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
The idea that he he's like

717
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,623
High School

718
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,255
It makes me think that Glenn Beck has

719
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
Something

720
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Two decent set

721
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
Ludacris monster

722
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,615
But the idea that he would never respond to Alex's overtures with

723
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,711
Working it is breaking up

724
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
I know better

725
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,599
I know better than to accept an overture from this man

726
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Wants to be

727
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Separate from Alec

728
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
The same way

729
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Alex

730
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:11,999
The same way Alex

731
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
You know where the

732
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
People who criticize him

733
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,655
Call Hera

734
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
Is Alex

735
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Crazy fight back

736
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
Going back to business model doesn't work out if they get along

737
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
Otherwise

738
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,807
Clear

739
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,647
Alex starts rambling

740
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
About

741
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,023
Athenian democracy I guess

742
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
Arab Tire racer

743
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:52,191
Opportunity to learn about

744
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Mythical figure

745
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,359
Democracy

746
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Black Ops

747
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
So it wasn't

748
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:47,487
Is the plant manager that Muhammad transitive property

749
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
Well I know it's not the visit

750
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
We have no idea

751
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
The power relation of the hammer to the

752
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
Or the stores

753
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
Perfect DPS rating

754
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
For each of the

755
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
I have no idea

756
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
Did a vacuum that's a good

757
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
Version of The Grecian

758
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Atlantic

759
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
Democracy

760
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:23,839
Little bit I don't care to give you a lecture about the difference between various

761
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
City-states

762
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
In-depth into that right now but

763
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
The blame for the situation

764
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,783
Indians are primarily concerned with her being blasphemy

765
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
People in the Public Square

766
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
I put him on trial for it

767
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
But he's found guilty is given the chance

768
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:54,815
Choose his own punishment should be given free meals for life

769
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Going to kill you

770
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
Even after being sent

771
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,679
It was very clear that they didn't really want to kill him

772
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,727
Totally cool if you just left

773
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,055
Issues

774
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,407
He believed so strongly in the rule of law

775
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,479
Fuse to save his own life by leaving

776
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,039
Since his death was what the law decided was his own

777
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah he was a

778
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:22,719
He was just the real a****** bothering Everybody by asking a question

779
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,815
Everybody

780
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
Prevalence conceptions

781
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
So

782
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,007
Assholes

783
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Tubi

784
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
4 people

785
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
Try not to

786
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Kill you

787
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Still have to go through

788
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:47,551
It's pretty bad is a real level of

789
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
You know

790
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Grandiosity

791
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:55,487
Alright we find you guilty of last

792
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
What should your punishment be

793
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:01,119
Feed me for life

794
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,191
Testicles God bless

795
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,591
Answer ASAP. The only things anyone even knows about his life come from Fairly unreliable sources the Border online

796
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,503
Existing most likely entirely as oral tradition for about six hundred years before they were ever written down

797
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
It's thrown off a cliff

798
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,623
Haven't been accused of stealing a cup from a temp

799
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:29,279
Other sources say that the reason he was killed is because he got really mad at the crowd in Delta Edison she was given

800
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
I wouldn't give him any money

801
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,631
Calling the delphian quote slaves of Olga

802
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
Because of his great offense to the Dignity of

803
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
The city of Delphi

804
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,335
He would bring great to the reputation by Taco

805
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
S*** about them wherever you want

806
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Someone suggested

807
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,687
Priest

808
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
We plan to the cup in his baggage

809
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Cassette ASAP

810
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
When did Elsa

811
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
Took a stop to the cliff

812
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
From what you was to be

813
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,439
I called on the music

814
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
And then threw himself off

815
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
Yeah

816
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
I mean tonight you're going to be in Rockford

817
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
You got time

818
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Yep yep

819
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,831
The religious traditions of Delphi

820
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,927
Calling the ritual sacrifices which

821
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
Amanda's body

822
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Didn't have much

823
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Herbalife

824
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,239
It's not entirely clear if any of them are actually literally true

825
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
His doll past announcers

826
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
600 years of oral tradition

827
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,127
Whatever the case there's some sort of the mythical reality

828
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
To the stories but no real reality

829
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
A large piece of how this story was used

830
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
Was to create an explanation

831
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
A subsequent violence

832
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
Against

833
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Adelphi

834
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:05,023
Within the oral tradition these events were not just bad luck or an isolated War they were the consequences of Delphi

835
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Immorally killing Aesop

836
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
The entire Affair takes on a cosmic importance

837
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,935
When you study oral tradition

838
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
You find a lot of assorted

839
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,287
Stories transform to fit stereotypes anarchist

840
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,847
Are you seated in the story of Aesop's death is

841
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,895
It becomes the story of a scapegoat that it

842
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Blaine's

843
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
These

844
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Incendies Wars

845
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
He became

846
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
His own face

847
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
But it's really funny

848
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
To see this little boy

849
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,999
See that he believes that lure is true throughout all of me

850
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,095
It's so Waurika truth

851
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,655
Get out of this little this framework

852
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
You know of of just thinking

853
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:50,847
Oldtimers

854
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Kind of fascinating

855
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
In the way that

856
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
Because we know he can't read

857
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,135
Fatty fatty

858
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Anything that said

859
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
The old whiskey bar

860
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Patriots of old

861
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Boy

862
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
Joel Wallach

863
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:23,615
Theo Ratliff come in

864
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
Can I just

865
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
Confirm

866
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Glacial milk

867
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Glacier milk

868
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
Glacier milk

869
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
Okay

870
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,367
That does not sound like something

871
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,951
I do actually I think

872
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,999
If you just went to a glacier and

873
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Belk have had great batting ever

874
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,655
Strawberry chocolate milk strawberry milk milk milk

875
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
Almond milk is okay

876
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,823
It's probably the only one I've had that's terrible

877
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
Didn't looking at banana milk and not

878
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,127
Kicking it out of my

879
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,247
Nesquik

880
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,551
It wasn't good flavors

881
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,791
Sky Zone show

882
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Infomercial

883
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
He has another guy

884
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,647
2013

885
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
Is so weird

886
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
He's completely transformed his narrative

887
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
The course of a few weeks

888
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
So now what

889
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,375
Context and understanding which were able to

890
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
Because we've spent the time

891
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Forget it

892
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
Bez to not even recognize what he's

893
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,007
He's done

894
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,127
After Sandy Hook Alex Russell for a little while without the shooter was probably staged by the globalist

895
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,943
Even Tiffany's 2012 they were a actors there

896
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
Kind of water

897
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,247
You need to be a vent tube

898
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
Be suspect

899
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,415
Because it's a globalist are behind the shooting that goes a long way

900
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
Navigation to take his gun

901
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,487
Narrative pivots

902
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:20,351
Becomes nothing short of a Gunn paranoid do p*** kind of thing for weeks

903
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:25,215
With every person who comes on the show being people like Larry Pratt Stewart Road

904
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,239
They show up concert

905
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,591
Credibility to Alex's screaming about how the big one is coming

906
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
Dwayne The Rock

907
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,527
This Patrick Coleman

908
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,623
Starting a petition to get Piers Morgan deported over

909
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
Of course

910
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,719
Vale because Pierce played along

911
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:52,095
The real combination is Alex going on a mortgage

912
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
B-36

913
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
That narrative play.

914
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,703
Exactly as it was supposed to

915
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
Alex's penetrated the mainstream news

916
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Everyone

917
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
Is just more proof

918
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
He's actually right

919
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
That is now fully implanted

920
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,455
So the narrative has to Pivot again

921
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
Instead of water in the gun paranoia

922
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Alex is able to build further upon the block

923
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
That he's

924
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
Created in order to get to his

925
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,047
This is a classic game of what I would describe as if this is true what month

926
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
If the globalist

927
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,423
Sage Sandy Hook it must also be true that they're doing that to come

928
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
If they're coming for Alex

929
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Two guns what else must be

930
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
It must also be true that the only thing that week

931
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
You can do is okay

932
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
Impeach Obama

933
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,943
This sure feels completely

934
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,735
In these couple of days

935
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,295
And you see it with these completely different gas

936
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,623
Focus on Obama and getting him out of office

937
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,671
Is Bang the Drum of the impeachment

938
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
Screaming over his Prescott

939
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,583
Gun paranoia he can call Pratt or

940
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,143
What do you need to push Financial collapse narrative

941
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
Call Gerald Celente

942
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Peter Schiff

943
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:06,335
And now that the theme of the show is change to wheel of God from Wheel of guns get ready to use your gun

944
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127
To we should impeach the president

945
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,199
He has a disgusting attempt at a publicity

946
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,735
Stop with the Obama Phone Lady

947
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,319
He's called in the most Obama

948
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Reverend

949
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
James David Manning

950
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
He is using this passage

951
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:24,767
This is very interesting the way that these narrative build upon each other

952
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:30,399
Knows well enough to jump off a pivot before it becomes stagnant

953
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
It's very urgent

954
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,007
I've been waiting for Manning to come back up on me

955
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,823
The show because that's the last time we talked about him

956
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
He's found himself

957
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
A little bit of trouble

958
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
I'm sexually harassing a former student

959
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Is Outlaw School

960
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
Someone who is conservative beliefs

961
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,367
2 years younger than

962
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
She was 18 when the tape was recorded but sat in it manager

963
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
Discusses how we started having sexual feeling

964
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,559
When she was 14

965
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
He talks about wanting to pull up her skirt

966
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
Incredible body

967
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,519
Editing a portion of our episode out

968
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
Because I couldn't find any sources that I would

969
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,615
Consider credible that were reported

970
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
So I thought they were

971
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
Smallest possibility

972
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:17,759
There was someone doing a really really good Reverend Manning

973
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
Impression

974
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
The post didn't

975
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
Expensive

976
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,391
Location of Manning's Outlaw Church

977
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
And the verdict is

978
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,767
And the picture of it is much darker than it

979
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,191
Even as dark as a 70 year old man with one of his former students absolutely is

980
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
That's very dark

981
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Manning

982
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
Real tile

983
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
Idaho

984
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:47,455
Attendees of Manning School

985
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
Church

986
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,319
A picture firmly forms

987
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,647
Because of his position wielded unbelievable level of power

988
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Which is more than happy to have

989
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,255
The first thing to consider is that parents would put their

990
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
Kids in the school are almost certainly members

991
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
His church

992
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
Almost

993
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
Manning is the most Godly person in the world

994
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
And Humanity's only

995
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,055
He's created Messianic thing about himself

996
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:17,151
Demonstrative pretty clearly Eclipse that we played where you yell

997
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,455
From the pulpit

998
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:25,343
You have a distorted view of

999
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
This guy

1000
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,695
F*****-up situation

1001
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
Use abusive punishments

1002
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:38,143
Like you're in the case of a student you locked in the church basement in the dark for 3.

1003
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
2011

1004
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Yeah

1005
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
What does wasn't allowed to eat

1006
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
On the first day

1007
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
The minutes drag.

1008
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
In the dark

1009
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
Alone in the

1010
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,175
F***** up

1011
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,735
Punishment

1012
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,527
Because they believed he was infallible

1013
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,855
Great great

1014
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Is the Arpaio of God

1015
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:05,791
Incidentally what that stood was being punished

1016
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
That girl didn't get punished

1017
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,983
Coincidence

1018
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,639
F***** up f***** up

1019
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,247
Slept with underage girl

1020
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Just leave

1021
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,575
It doesn't guy put them in a bucket

1022
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
3 days

1023
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:35,999
Jesus Christ

1024
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,535
Yeah

1025
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
F***

1026
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,863
The number to read about this HuffPost article

1027
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Are terrifying

1028
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,447
Whether it's through the kinds of

1029
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
Biblical punishment

1030
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:50,847
The employees

1031
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
And the kids can't lie

1032
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,711
Because their parents believe that the school's Headmaster is infallible

1033
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
And he's made a practice of convincing parents to

1034
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Disown their children when they question

1035
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,135
Just think about the situation that puts me

1036
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,487
They can either put up with literally whatever Manning wants to do to them

1037
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,815
Or they can risk be disowned and expelled

1038
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,863
Becoming homeless and high school dropout

1039
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,167
And that's not hypothetical either

1040
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,239
That's literally what happened to multiple students who believed

1041
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,567
The tape of Manning sexually harassing his former student was real

1042
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,871
Joshua

1043
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,431
Who Manning baselessly accused of being gay

1044
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,527
Kicked out of the school and became a high school dropout

1045
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
And then later I also to that guy's brother Isaiah

1046
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,951
Then Derek Mills was kicked out for refusing to end his friendship with the Isaiah

1047
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
Debussy in Flex on these people their own fault

1048
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,887
After he kicked the students who believed that that was

1049
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,935
Is real he said this from the pulpit

1050
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:52,543
Tarifa song that's the guy

1051
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,175
Friends I've been LED down a path

1052
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,247
Destruction by following him

1053
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,599
Many of you tonight do not have your children with you because of the LIE perpetrated

1054
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,415
False doctor tape perpetrated by Hassan

1055
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
From the pulpit

1056
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,095
Yap

1057
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,655
You say many of you have lost

1058
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,447
Because

1059
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,983
Your kids are liars

1060
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,079
He goes on to call the students in theater

1061
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
Expelled

1062
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,455
The Huff Post article includes this endlessly

1063
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Flea terrify

1064
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:38,111
Quote. The former students watched on their computers and phones horrified at the idea of their parents

1065
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
Siblings

1066
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,463
Intermittently participating in Clapton

1067
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
Eggman calls their children

1068
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Terrifying

1069
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,215
Also one article I read I can't confirm

1070
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,751
Another article

1071
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,055
They said that they spoke to

1072
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Church members

1073
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,871
Who said that

1074
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Ask them to

1075
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Do s*** in bags

1076
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
And leave them at Galen business

1077
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
In retaliation

1078
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,927
He has himself to spread poop

1079
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:18,559
I would question whether that's or if it was him protecting about what he was

1080
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
So

1081
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,631
This is gross

1082
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
Cult leadership

1083
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:27,775
Positive HuffPost covered it and hopefully word

1084
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,103
Dangerous lunatic who's abusing his congregation

1085
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
A Zone in Richmond

1086
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
Four former congregants told HuffPost

1087
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,295
Decided a few years ago

1088
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
To the church

1089
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,135
That's when he started imploring followers to give him access to their Bank

1090
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,511
He told them they didn't know how to manage their money and that he would take better care of it

1091
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,583
Which is something that cool pastors do

1092
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,399
What makes all this extra scary is it in 26

1093
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
60

1094
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
What the hell man in my tree

1095
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,263
Respond if his grip on his flock was ever truly threatened

1096
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,847
He owned about an old about a million dollars and utility bills

1097
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,615
The back taxes

1098
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
A church was in danger of being

1099
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
Foreclosed on

1100
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:13,599
Desperation man made a video threatening to barricade himself inside the

1101
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Search with kids from

1102
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Community

1103
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:19,231
He said the standoff could turn violent quote worse than Wounded Knee

1104
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,279
It's unclear if he was imagining

1105
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,095
Himself

1106
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
Lakota in that analogy

1107
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,703
It's clear that you was sending a message

1108
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:33,567
But if anyone tries to come take his building was perfectly fine using the children of this congregation

1109
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
Is human shield

1110
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,175
Particular importance of today's episode

1111
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:44,831
Alex Jones spends a lot of time talking about children

1112
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
What he's talking about gun regular

1113
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:51,743
It's a gross way for Alex to attack the idea that there are used to affected by gun violence

1114
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,023
What's an orange favor of gun can

1115
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,327
Control Elisa

1116
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,143
The guy Alex called demon eyes Obama

1117
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,959
Guy who was literally threatening

1118
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
To use her children

1119
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Shield

1120
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:07,871
Just a few years later and at the time of this interview this recording

1121
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,687
He was actively traumatizing students at his b*******

1122
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
It's a

1123
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,879
Massive level of inappropriate that Alex

1124
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,791
This guy doesn't like

1125
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,839
What's a super inches

1126
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,423
Did right now to demonize Obama

1127
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
Who can help me with that

1128
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,055
We just listened to

1129
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Meet a lot of

1130
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Really bad thing

1131
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,639
About rubber matting

1132
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
Which

1133
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
That's terrible

1134
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,743
God bless you sir

1135
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
Alex

1136
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,839
You shouldn't feel a connection with this guy

1137
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Stop the show

1138
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,591
Who you've never heard of

1139
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Unconstitutional Federal

1140
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:31,071
Cool earlier Alex on the show it said that these people

1141
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,631
Steve

1142
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
He's rapping

1143
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:39,263
Texas you look into people who really fight

1144
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
Dyed-in-the-wool

1145
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
These are people that lived in Texas

1146
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
He was born in

1147
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
New York grew up in upstate

1148
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Rochester

1149
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,783
I hate every

1150
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,391
Things about Steve that I want to tell you about

1151
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,463
Well that's number one

1152
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
Number two

1153
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
He won his seat in the State House of Representative

1154
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,607
Texas election with no Democrat running

1155
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,959
He only was up against the candidate from the libertarian party and I truly want either

1156
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,799
In 2014 he decided to give up his

1157
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,591
District 15 in speaker

1158
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
16th District

1159
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,735
But lost ultimately showing at the support he was received most of which came from

1160
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Party

1161
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
Wasn't enough to get him back into a

1162
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,599
Possibly more important

1163
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,391
Elevated ALT

1164
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,719
House of

1165
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,607
In 2018

1166
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,143
Then ran once again for the

1167
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,935
Giving up back in 2014

1168
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
He Texas

1169
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
House district 50

1170
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
He wants ended up right where you left off

1171
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
Just considering how high

1172
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
House of Representatives

1173
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,711
How they don't have Turbo

1174
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:58,111
He literally just wasted everyone's time and money because of misguided ambition

1175
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:03,231
Government

1176
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,047
Don't know if he is

1177
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,327
He is not interested in

1178
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,631
Unlike the nuts and bolts of writing good

1179
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Whynotbi

1180
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,727
An office now because of this

1181
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
Significant donations

1182
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,055
Supportive multiple far-right political action

1183
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
Heeded their former speaker

1184
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
Joe Straus

1185
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
If you was to close

1186
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
To the center

1187
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
Course Hardline anti-immigrant

1188
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
Islam

1189
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
I need a lot of money

1190
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,879
To make sure the conservatives once eaten that election work not

1191
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
The types

1192
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Would be against Trump

1193
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:38,303
Muslim ban the bills flying around to dictate who could use what

1194
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,119
These political action committees wanted Warriors

1195
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
And Steve Tok was willing

1196
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
To be that to get back in office

1197
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
In 2018

1198
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Great job.

1199
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
What is groups

1200
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
Texas right to life

1201
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,591
Which gave toast 17,000

1202
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,615
$500 for

1203
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,223
Incycle Texas right to life received

1204
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
China criticism

1205
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
For turning on anti-choice

1206
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
They supported for a long time

1207
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
My favorite new options

1208
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
Who were crazy far-right

1209
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,999
Text support

1210
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
His kind of lost their way

1211
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
That's unfortunate.

1212
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
To do

1213
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,167
That's a quote from Paul Workman

1214
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,239
Former representative of Texas's 47th District

1215
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:25,151
Workman literally Champion legislation that would require women to get a sonogram before receiving an abortion in hopes of making her

1216
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,687
Her experience that would change your mind

1217
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,807
He supported every choice bill ever introduced including one that would increase the license

1218
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
Requirements

1219
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,647
Providers the goal of which was pretty explicitly

1220
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,671
Play the first time to clinics

1221
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,439
Close

1222
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
The political action

1223
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,999
Committee that donated seven

1224
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,047
1500 dollars

1225
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Steve Toth

1226
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,351
Thought work

1227
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,655
Middle-of-the-road on abortion

1228
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,751
Well I mean if you take a look at the Alabama just pass

1229
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,895
I guess anything but aside from the death penalty right

1230
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
Performing an abortion price

1231
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,271
I'm trying to give you a sense of what kind of politics

1232
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,063
These people who are funding him we're looking

1233
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,135
Alabama Que

1234
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,279
Interstate agreement for whatever

1235
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,119
In 2014 the Texas Freedom Network wrote piece about huskies tofu

1236
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Was too extreme

1237
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
A Texas Republican

1238
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,751
A completely fabricated

1239
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
Crusade against the Texas school district

1240
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
Curriculum management tools

1241
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,359
Complaining that their life

1242
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:31,199
Comes workload anti-American anti-christian

1243
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
Also the article includes this

1244
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,319
Also tells a ridiculous story

1245
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
To promote his opposition

1246
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,903
Sex education that includes information about birthday

1247
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,719
During the 2013 legislative session

1248
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,351
So hot and bothered Parenthood sex education

1249
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
Glass

1250
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:56,543
Perception that the girl in the car later

1251
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:02,431
Legislative budget cuts

1252
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
The quote

1253
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Does women's health program

1254
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,063
Electrical tens of thousands of low-income women

1255
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Family Planning

1256
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Shouldn't

1257
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
Mean that

1258
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:15,743
That they should have stayed in the sex extrication class

1259
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,815
No I don't think

1260
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,631
Finish the part of the class

1261
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:27,519
I don't think anyone is getting real horny during Planned Parenthood sex education talks

1262
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
Education talk

1263
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,151
Boulder City super hard right

1264
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Sex education

1265
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,735
Teacher told me that having

1266
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,271
Sex without a condom

1267
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,551
Put in your hair

1268
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Into a vat

1269
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
Nuclear waste

1270
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Condom with

1271
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
Putting I

1272
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,559
Glove on your hand when you put it into a

1273
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
F****** thing

1274
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,423
Vaginas are nuclear White

1275
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
Exactly

1276
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:03,103
Steve Toth was too extreme for the Texas Republican party in 2014

1277
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,199
Not anymore

1278
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
We're not going to listen

1279
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
I like to play a new game called

1280
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,135
The GOP or icy

1281
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Pic quotes

1282
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,119
It's really just a case of Alex Jones bring in a lunatic State politician

1283
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:30,751
Auto Show do dog and pony show them agree with his ideas to let some kind of governmental credibility

1284
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
The things he's putting out

1285
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
It's mostly just Alex yelling about how they should arm teachers

1286
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Steve agreeing

1287
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,943

Just sort of like Alex has a government representative on because

1292
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
You know

1293
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
Impeachment starts in the house

1294
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:00,959
There is Oki Carolyn state government

1295
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,287
Gotcha interview

This is

1306
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
Bulshit

1307
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,711
He been complaining other days about the website

1308
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:24,831
He's very specific about because they're trying to upgrade

1309
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,695
Text cuz they're trying to update

1310
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:34,815
A new version like Infowars 2.0

1311

Help

1314
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,255
Create the idea that

1315
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,839
Obama's afraid of Alex putting out articles of impeachment

1316
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,191
Got on stage for the press conference

1317
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,311
Because they couldn't handle the idea of being able to respond

1318
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,359
To his at whatever I was saying

1319
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,639
Sofa

Exact same thing

1321
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Imagine

01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,319
Denial-of-service attacks

1323
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,367

That's what he's doing

1326
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
A hundred percent

1327
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Crazy

1328
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,535
Alex loves

1329
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
To talk movies

1330
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,887
To be fair to say that

1331
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,447
You generally misses the point

1332
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:47,007
I mean

1333
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Let's

1334
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,383
Asia mandamus

1335
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:58,527
Is the good guy

1336
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Oftentimes

1337
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,671
In stories of heroes and villains

1338
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Discerning

1339
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
Which is which

1340
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,839
Movie theater

1341
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,447
Comic books are bad but it turns out comedies are also bad for now

1342
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,511
So Alex is expressing he feels like he's in

1343
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
In Groundhog Day

1344
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,839
Because you just keep seeing the globalist

1345
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,631
Metal whenever Wonderlic

1346
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:49,215
Here's what I would say the point of that movie is that

1347
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Bill Murray

1348
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,847
Yes and the only thing that gets him out of the time Loop is

1349
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,383
Not being an ass

1350
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,247
Realizing he's been living his life completely wrong

1351
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
For others is

1352
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
Actually a much better way to live

1353
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,439
And then he gets to go to the next day finally wants

1354
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
Grows through the Despair and

1355
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,559
Utility of killing himself

1356
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,863
Elvis is Alex really feels

1357
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,399
Like he's living Groundhog Day

1358
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
Consider the message

1359
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
YouTube that movie

1360
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
Maybe

1361
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,055
You're an a******

1362
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,455
Bill Murray

1363
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,271
No no

1364
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:38,111
Interview that

1365
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,159
Bill Murray

1366
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,207
Play trapped in that time Loop for like Millions

1367
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
Yeah yeah

1368
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,047
It doesn't give me much hope for Alex

1369
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
To the other side

1370
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,679
But it would be immediate for us

1371
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,287
Any other day

1372
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:09,599
Fascinating

1373
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,927
Along with his inability to differentiate truth

1374
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
Fiction

1375
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,279
He also has no idea how to engage with the message

1376
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Do not

1377
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,887
Like anybody who

1378
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Groundhog Day would get

1379
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:29,055
It's the only way it's her purse Improvement

1380
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,919
He leaves the timer

1381
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,831
Stephen tobolowsky

1382
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,367
Great

1383
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Love it

1384
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,951
Sew-ins next clip Alex Goes to call

1385
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,791
Just because I think we might have found

1386
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,567
Somebody from Africa Alex

1387
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
Happy that's right Alex

1388
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
The good part

1389
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,463
Yeah I know that's bad that's bad start

1390
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Back

1391
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
Afrikaner is

1392
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,071
Starting

1393
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
You can tell is probably

1394
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,775
Believe what you might describe as a racist stuff at Montreal

1395
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,591
But what's interesting is it called isn't about that

1396
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,919
The extent of his

1397
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Just

1398
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,479
Flippant

1399
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,807
Actually wants to talk about

1400
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,927
You mentioned your web service have been going down well

1401
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:55,327
You're not the only one so to speak I am a web developer and researcher and I'm here to tell you that the Illuminati is

1402
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Back online

1403
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Breaking news

1404
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,679
Now what do I mean by that

1405
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:02,239
Goodguys member of the Illuminati card game

1406
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,103
Okay interesting thing is this card Game Spot It Out

1407
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
Online game

1408
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
Okay

1409
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:14,271
Illuminati

1410
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,343
GameStop

1411
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,135
Steve Jackson's games

1412
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,719
What's rated R

1413
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,767
And the dates are that was on that server

1414
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,351
The game was never supposed to get out according to Steven

1415
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
Don't do that

1416
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
You look

1417
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Very

1418
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,623
How are

1419
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,415
People

1420
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,975
Give me Miss South Africa

1421
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
I don't know how

1422
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,655
This is

1423
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:06,239
And I don't need to card game is one of the most

1424
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
Perfect conspiracy things

1425
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,383
In the world I'm so glad that this dumb race is South Africa

1426
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,527
I need the card game itself is

1427
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:24,415
Illuminati plans

1428
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,743
Use lesser Magic on the bus

1429
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,583
It is our people this.

1430
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,863
It's amazing

1431
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,959
The short version is how's it goes

1432
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,543
Illuminati is a card game that was created

1433
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
Games of 1982

1434
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
The goals game is take on the role of the speaker

1435
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,687
Society which goes on to take over the world

1436
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,295
There's a very successful game of the circles that played massively complicated

1437
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,319
In the early 80s

1438
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,903
And it spawned expansion packs have been released over the years the most recent

1439
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
Coming out 20

1440
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,999
The concept of the game started out with Steve Jackson

1441
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,535
Considering creating an adaptation

1442
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
Robert Anton Wilson

1443
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Illuminati

1444
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Trilogy

1445
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
But that would be

1446
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
B2 convoluted

1447
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:11,775
Confusing so I'm not even going to get that shot

1448
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
Mostly convoluted

1449
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
It's not as confusing

1450
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,456
Play that bud

1451
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:23,040
I'd love it really hard to find

1452
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
The main one

1453
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
I'd like to shop

1454
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,464
Jackson realized

1455
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
To do

1456
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,048
Adapt

1457
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,328
The illuminatus trilogy

1458
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,864
He could take the basic

1459
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
She's like the notion of Grant

1460
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
Conspiracies being Bhai

1461
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Everything

1462
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,728
And use that as the

1463
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
Concept

1464
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
His game

1465
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Approved

1466
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,824
Be a viable jump-off boy

1467
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
Conspiracy theory worlds together something

1468
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
Details

1469
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,296
He created quite a bit of a client

1470
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,624
The Nerds loved it but have such high praise

1471
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,488
I felt like his work was

1472
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,768
Just enough so he couldn't

1473
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,560
He was very mad about

1474
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
Yeah

1475
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:13,216
Illuminatus Trilogy as a work of satire

1476
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
It's bent

1477
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
To try to make fun of and mock

1478
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
The patterns of reason

1479
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Chrissy Theory

1480
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
And Jackson's card game

1481
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
Extension of that

1482
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,480
The cards are over-the-top by Design

1483
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,528
Naturally cuz it's parody

1484
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
That means

1485
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
When you

1486
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
As as always

1487
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Face when you make a

1488
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,160
Satire

1489
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Conspiracy theory

1490
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,560
1994 expansion

1491
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,864
Impact that's called New World Order

1492
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,400
They're pretty wild in Heinz

1493
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,704
One of them is the terrorists

1494
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
The Duke car

1495
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,568
The visual on that card is a nuke being shot at

1496
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
The Twin Towers

1497
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:55,712
Pretty similar to what

1498
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
CIO with 9/11

1499
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:01,856
The game was made right after the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993

1500
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
Free

1501
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,952
It might not be as crazy as I am

1502
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Just on 1st

1503
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Glance right

1504
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,352
Nearest used that card and a couple others

1505
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,912
Steve Jackson new was coming into this game is proof

1506
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
It's lesser Magic

1507
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:20,544
Tricks

1508
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,640
The World Trade Center

1509
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:30,272
Trade Center bombed the first time

1510
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
That would be bombed

1511
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,928
Nobody's better than the first world trade

1512
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
Play fast and loose with

1513
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,072
The original that came out 1980

1514
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,656
Car came out in 94

1515
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,192
So when conspiracy theorists

1516
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,472
Talk about these cards

1517
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,360
Usually talk about it having a hit came out in 82 and predicted 9/11 when that car came out

1518
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,176
The First World Trade Center bombing

1519
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,224
It's all these cheap gameplay

1520
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
Also

1521
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
Conspiracy theorist

1522
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
Are less prone to use the following cards

1523
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
To make their argument

1524
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,368
About predictive programming

1525
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:14,560
What does Godzilla

1526
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Bigfoot

1527
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
Count Dracula

1528
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,680
Potato

1529
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,496
Yeah yeah that one probably would do the job

1530
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,776
Flying saucers

1531
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,056
Literal Gremlins

1532
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,872
The hammer of Thor

1533
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
Crabland

1534
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:38,112
Hitler's book

1535
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,648
Love it

1536
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,256
Set

1537
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,328
Robot monster

1538
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,888
Choose to play as

1539
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,168
Your secret society

1540
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:57,568
Your Illuminati are the Servants of Cthulhu I ever lost it

1541
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,848
But now I know who your plan

1542
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
The game is a parody of conspiracy

1543
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,992
Some extent even take shots at itself

1544
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,784
One of the cards in the deck is

1545
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,320
Trading Card Game

1546
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,904
And features a suspicious man opening his trench coat to reveal cards

1547
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,720
Inside that he's selling

1548
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,560
I've never played it but all the reviews I've read make it

1549
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,376
You seem like a really fun game that uses interesting strategy

1550
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
The elements

1551
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
And it's one

1552
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
For Origins Awards

1553
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
The first of which was being the

1554
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
The best science fiction

1555
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,568
Board game award in 1982

1556
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
So it's not like this is

1557
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,640
Some kind of accident

1558
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
We got out like I is

1559
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,992
The race of South Africa

1560
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
That idea is f******

1561
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,576
I want this game so bad

1562
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,112
I would love to track it down

1563
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:45,184
Also Alex should know better than to say that this car game is in

1564
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
Anyway a real Illuminati

1565
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
The game

1566
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
You think there's a card in the deck

1567
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,328
The agent in place card

1568
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,936
I was just the games version of an infiltrator or spy for your Illuminati group

1569
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,240
The picture on that card there's a

1570
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
Striking resemblance

1571
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,920
To Alex Jones notice

1572
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:12,576
94

1573
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
Coincidence

1574
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,160
It could be a winking joke on Steve Jackson

1575
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Apart cuz

1576
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,488
The card it came out 1994

1577
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,304
And that point Alex was on Austin local access

1578
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,608
In Jackson does operate out of Boston

1579
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,936
So it's possible that he would have been aware of Alex and Olivia wink

1580
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,032
But my problem is that the car looks a lot like a later day Alex

1581
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,616
Not a lot like 94

1582
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:38,688
He looks like he's chubby present

1583
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,224
More than

1584
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Pat

1585
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,064
So I don't know I think it's probably just a coincidence

1586
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,184
That take conspiracy people have built a new wrinkle 12

1587
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,560
There is no like

1588
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,864
Conspiracy theory that easy predict

1589
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
911

1590
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,936
He did predict that Alex

1591
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
Was going to be fat with a

1592
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:08,128
Eddie's talking into a mustard the phone

1593
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,456
I just received Jackson games getting nothing to do with the

1594
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
Illuminati card game

1595
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,576
Board game

1596
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,344
Award

1597
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,416
82 and the raid didn't happen until March 1st

1598
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
90

1599
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,232
The decks involving all the cards

1600
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
Conspiracy theorist

1601
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
We're still four years away

1602
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,584
From being made when the raid went down

1603
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
Itself

1604
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:34,240
Direct on called Illuminati

1605
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,568
What are the operators of that board was a hacker named blue blanket

1606
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
The track down stolen document

1607
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,944
Information about BellSouth

1608
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,808
Dude that bulletin board at another one run by Blankenship

1609
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,392
The court documents reflect the agent-based a search warrant on

1610
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
On the fact that

1611
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,512
BellSouth computer system

1612
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:00,864
Something 9/11 BellSouth document was a sensitive

1613
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Arabic

1614
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,912
Computer hackers were tempting

1615
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
Utilize the decryption

1616
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
Procedure

1617
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,312
Computer programs included the defense department

1618
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,872
And these hackers were soliciting password

1619
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,432
So that the decryption procedure could become operator

1620
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:19,552
Misunderstanding that happened in the investigation however

1621
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,344
Blankenship Ram this message

1622
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,136
Message board for Steve Jackson games

1623
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,208
Up and also called

1624
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,536
Investigate

1625
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,120
However

1626
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
Message board for

1627
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,728
He saw this greeting and got the wrong idea about

1628
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:40,032
Greetings mortal

1629
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,152
All right of course this is this is

1630
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,968
Drag the FBI agent reading this just like

1631
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
People

1632
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:55,392
You've entered the secret computer system of the Illuminati the online home of the world's oldest and largest secret

1633
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:00,000
Steve Jackson games Incorporated

1634
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
Call God cuz he didn't understand the humor of the site

1635
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,472
Foley thought that was an indication that this message board run for

1636
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:15,872
Was wrapped up in the 9/11 documenting malicious hacking with the game company being a fake front business

1637
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,344
Such a farce

1638
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,904
The fact Blankenship was an employee

1639
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:33,280
Steve Jackson games didn't help the game company got included in the raid and their computers and materials were

1640
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
From there

1641
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,608
Everything went to s***

1642
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,912
The investigators have created a mess

1643
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,704
Because they failed to do their homework

1644
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:44,032
They have the ability to learn that the

1645
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
The seizure of the Illuminati bullet

1646
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
Board included

1647
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
Private and public electronic communications

1648
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:54,272
The seizure of which was not within the scope of their warrant was a breach of the Privacy protection

1649
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,112
By the next day after the raids

1650
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
His stuff back

1651
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:02,720
Which experts estimated should have been able to been copied if needed

1652
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:06,560
And Richard H and no more than within 8 days

1653
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,608
He would not get his things back

1654
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
Until late June 1990

1655
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:15,776
Approximately 3 1/2 months later which was a huge problem for him

1656
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
Cuz They confiscated all this s***

1657
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,616
Yeah

1658
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,712
Steve Jackson ended up suing the Secret Service and women

1659
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:29,600
I got $50,000 in statutory damages and $250,000 in lawyer

1660
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:34,208
The judge did find that the rated ultimately not cause financial hardship

1661
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
However

1662
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:39,584
The reasoning was that the company has been in

1663
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,864
Bad financial shape

1664
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,680
The time did actually raise their profile

1665
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,448
Considerably

1666
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,800
Plus Steve created a game based on the radar was selling quite well

1667
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
So they just decided it was a wash

1668
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:56,992
Knockout Prophets

1669
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,016
Catastrophic

1670
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,392
50000 statutory damages is

1671
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,464
Not enough

1672
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:12,352
Guilty as charged with a crime

1673
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,888
For nothing

1674
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:18,496
Maybe but I also kind of suspect that Nom charging might have had some

1675
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,288
Nothing to do with how bungled this raid was

1676
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:25,920
The objective was it stolen 911 document even if they were able to establish the blank

1677
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Stolen

1678
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,736
Which I'm not sure they ever did

1679
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,272
Taking this to trial Beyond

1680
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
F****** night

1681
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:35,392
Yeah so there's like wash your hands

1682
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,536
And how the rate

1683
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:45,632
It has nothing to do with the Illuminati card game or the government trying to stop him

1684
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
From getting their seats

1685
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:50,496
In reality the court documents make it clear that agent.

1686
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,568
No investigation about Steve Jackson games

1687
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,872
Incorporated although a reasonable address

1688
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:02,528
Only several hours

1689
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,832
Mr. Jackson would have cooperated in the investigation

1690
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,160
They f*** this up top-to-bottom they do nothing

1691
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,464
Yeah

1692
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,280
Very clear that they didn't even know they made games

1693
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,608
Let alone different Illuminati game free

1694
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,960
Also just ask your honor in my client's defense

1695
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,776
They're really bad

1696
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,592
The defense

1697
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,896
Also just to be totally clear about this

1698
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,176
The color is a time like

1699
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,248
At the time of the raids

1700
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,600
Games was working on it about to release a rope called

1701
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,624
Cyberpunk

1702
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:42,464
Northrup's is an acronym for a generic Universal

1703
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:48,608
Play RPGs on bulletin boards with this guidebook

1704
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:53,984
McGruff cyberpunk

1705
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,008
Dragon Ball Z

1706
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
There is

1707
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,824
Is this message board that I went to on an

1708
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,592
Angelfire

1709
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,968
Complicated role-playing

1710
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:10,880
These groups the generic Universal role-playing system was a response to the idea that a lot of these games are really fun but they do

1711
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
You played in certain

1712
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,488
Like D&D could only be played as this fantasy

1713
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:22,144
You know that other ones were generic Universal

1714
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,448
Developed by Steve

1715
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
For all

1716
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
So different types

1717
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
Of role-playing

1718
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:31,104
What cyberpunk role-playing

1719
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
Adventures

1720
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,408
Straight up

1721
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,432
Office culture

1722
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
You're just

1723
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
You're rolling

1724
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
If you bake small

1725
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:45,696
You could do that this is a cyberpunk horatian of this that was being worked on

1726
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,024
Interfere with a release

1727
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,608
Confusing with the Illuminati card

1728
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,912
The card game came out 8 years earlier

1729
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,192
But ultimately

1730
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:59,264
Satirist

1731
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,360
For sure conspiracy isn't that juicy when it's just a guidebook for a

1732
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,128
Punk roleplay

1733
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,408
Yeah that probably does

1734
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,456
No

1735
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,736
Spinosaurus

1736
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,040
Like whenever there's these sorts of

1737
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,344
Turtles of

1738
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
I guess you'd call it

1739
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,928
Conspiracy lower

1740
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:20,768
The better story behind

1741
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,560
To in order to make their fake store

1742
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:23,584
Yeah cuz that's a good

1743
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,424
Government

1744
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:33,056
Totally

1745
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:37,920
It's a comical level of ineptitude from the agents

1746
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
Or some s*** like

1747
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,064
Enough material for a movie

1748
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
But the scene is

1749
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,368
Yes

1750
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
Completely

1751
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Screwing it up

1752
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,768
But that doesn't stop Alex from

1753
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
Atomic bomb

1754
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,288
Probably let's go

1755
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
Atomic monster

1756
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Like this card

1757
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,968
That shows the one of the Twin Towers getting hit

1758
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,272
That's all

1759
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:17,600
Proved

1760
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,440
What is at the border for entry

1761
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Conspiracy

1762
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,536
Solo

1763
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,608
Alex

1764
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
From someone

1765
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Via the Bebe

1766
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,472
DC the British Broadcasting Company

1767
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,176
40 times a day

1768
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,624
So this is also part of that Darcy

1769
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:29,024
Statistic aggrandizement

1770
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,168
It goes along with the you know the government's targeting me as soon as I put out this Obama in

1771
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,192
Impeachment thing

1772
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:39,776
It's kind of a way of focusing that save energy

1773
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,616
Of the navel-gazing I was on Piers Morgan and using it

1774
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,384
Facilitate

1775
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,944
The anti-obama narrative

1776
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,480
Each man narratives it is

1777
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,504
Recurrent theme of the

1778
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,808
The show

1779
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Backhoe

1780
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,112
Didn't

1781
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,904
But it sure does make him look

1782
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
Good when he take

1783
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,840
Julian the Collies like

1784
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,376
I could have just

1785
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,656
15 minutes

1786
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
Ordering any commercial break

1787
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:13,056
There's no reason to do except demonstrate your audience

1788
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,336
I'm in demand

1789
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:17,408
Is the BBC

1790
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:21,504
But they still work

1791
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,296
So far just b i TV

1792
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Right

1793
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,624
Remember how I told you to

1794
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,744
Women's Health

1795
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,536
Texas

1796
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Because of his book

1797
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
Story about

1798
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,728
People f****** yeah after health class

1799
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:48,128
Be like you know sex education

1800
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,272
I think that's a stupid thing for him to

1801
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
To think

1802
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
Yes

1803
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
And it blew my mind

1804
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,880
That Alex

1805
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
Later in the same episodes

1806
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,080
That's insane

1807
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
What

1808
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128
That's a nut

1809
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,480
Looking at

1810
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,088
I'd like the bisexual

1811
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,792
I mean I remember it

1812
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,096
Spare Laguna

1813
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,120
Universal

1814
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
Yeah

1815
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,704
It's a teacher's are uncomfortable

1816
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,520
Questions

1817
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:52,384
Piece of paper and then handing it to are like putting it in a bucket so nobody knows who is at

1818
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:57,248
It's not a horny making experience

1819
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:01,088
F***** up Alex is looking at it

1820
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
That class is deeply uncomfortable

1821
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,464
Be completely bizarre

1822
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
Interpretation

1823
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,280
Sex education

1824
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,560
Existing with

1825
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,120
These two people on the same show

1826
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
We're like

1827
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
Toast with expressing this analysis

1828
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
Very weird

1829
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
Exact

1830
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,016
He's in Texas

1831
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:33,856
Rochester

1832
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,136
Maybe it's just

1833
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,416
Must be

1834
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,976
Different there

1835
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,840
Discomfort about sex education

1836
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,680
That means that almost every Coming of Age movies

1837
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:50,240
Except in the Midwest

1838
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,176
This is where I

1839
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
In this episode

1840
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,552
Alex

1841
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,392
Goes from there is

1842
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,672
Really weird

1843
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,720
And I like down for this

1844
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:19,936
Adam Lanza

1845
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:25,312
Control

1846
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,992
Record now

1847
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,624
Try to buy gun five times

1848
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
Shop

1849
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:45,024
What is mental illness was in the health record

1850
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:54,240
Private dealers

1851
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,968
That's a weird train of thought

1852
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
Yeah

1853
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,552
First of all

1854
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:11,648
There's a lot is a lot in a couple seconds there

1855
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:17,280
Gun shows where they don't sell to you if you look like an illegal immigrant

1856
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:23,168
Does Adam Lanza look like an illegal immigrant do that what he seems

1857
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
I don't know what he's expressing

1858
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:31,872
Conversation

1859
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,736
The very weird and Felons are innocent

1860
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,296
Are you going to talk about Criminal Justice Reform

1861
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,344
I'm here for that

1862
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,208
Criminal Justice Reform

1863
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Starts

1864
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,048
Giving felons guns after they get out

1865
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:55,424
Esorts

1866
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,824
In the day if you got prison while you were holding the shotgun when you got out of prison

1867
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:04,384
That seems like a bad policy.

1868
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,408
She got that from

1869
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:12,064
I think that's from like old western tv shows

1870
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:18,720
Baby yeah that's like that's like a story of somebody

1871
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:25,120
Sleeping one off and then they still get their shot got back from the f****** local sheriff

1872
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:27,424
The prison in the first place

1873
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,752
A little baby that is a casein like in

1874
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
I don't know

1875
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
I don't I don't like

1876
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,664
What he's probably saying with the most

1877
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
Cuz I don't

1878
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:46,624
Ross 280

1879
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,648
Felony drug possession

1880
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,720
They shouldn't be stripped of the right town

1881
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Brett there's

1882
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,888
There's not room for conversation there but

1883
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,448
Alex saying they don't sell

1884
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
Like illegal immigrants

1885
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,544
Bonkers unacceptable

1886
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,944
Very weird that he doesn't elaborate or illegal immigrants

1887
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,480
About saying look like

1888
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,760
Like a hahaha

1889
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:17,344
He was going over

1890
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,648
Obama's

1891
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,184
Talking about this

1892
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,096
You're seeing a little bit of code here

1893
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,912
Liberty talks about his gun issue

1894
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,960
Weird

1895
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,752
Little bit of coded language

1896
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,032
It keeps coming up

1897
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,312
It is strange

1898
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
Almost like

1899
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,104
The guns are there

1900
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:41,920
Boy I can't

1901
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
Responsible for

1902
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,576
So is this next clip Alex has a

1903
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,344
The plaintiff

1904
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,368
Stop school shooting

1905
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,952
Of course we know it's armed teachers

1906
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
Why not

1907
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,000
It's armed teachers

1908
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,352
Idea of who the arm

1909
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:30,048
The teachers

1910
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,352
You just explained

1911
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:43,872
Imagine the nightmare scenario of a teacher shooting up a school

1912
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,640
Hand

1913
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,176
Teacher accidentally shooting

1914
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,248
Brandishing a

1915
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,272
Terrible

1916
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,320
Just the idea of you

1917
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:56,416
And then a guns on the table

1918
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,464
F*** you

1919
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,792
Also the idea of arming the

1920
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
Knox

1921
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:06,144
Discuss that other than to say

1922
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,216
Dave daubenmire

1923
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
By my height

1924
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:20,224
Every football coaches

1925
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,088
Teachers who are weirdos

1926
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:29,696
Maybe it's the same

1927
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,000
He's a f****** Luna

1928
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,792
Bluetick

1929
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,608
Is this narcissistic

1930
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Trend

1931
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,912
Fracture

1932
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,984
He's doing this fake

1933
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:48,384
Denial of service

1934
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,176
In this next clip

1935
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,736
You finally gets around to playing some of the clips

1936
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
Of Obama's

1937
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
Speech

1938
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,856
And Alex becomes convinced that Obama is talking about

1939
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:03,232
What's 47

1940
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:09,120
Assault by tyrants on Liberty

1941
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
This will be difficult

1942
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,688
Probably covestro

1943
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,016
But because

1944
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,320
They want to Jennifer

1945
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
Or higher ratings

1946
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,392
Or revenue for themselves

1947
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,000
I'll do everything I can

1948
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,816
The block any Common Sense refer

1949
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,864
Make sure nothing changes whatsoever

1950
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:46,752
The only way we will be able change is it

1951
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,080
Nevermind

1952
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
Ba bar

1953
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:30,016
Bob

1954
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:33,856
That is that is a lunatic level grandiosity

1955
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:40,512
I mean

1956
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:43,072
Yeah probably I don't know is Larry Pratt

1957
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,376
Is necessarily on Obama's radar

1958
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,192
You probably not the president

1959
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,520
Please talk about ratings he's probably talking about Rush Limbaugh

1960
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:55,104
Yep probably not talking about Alex Jones Glenn back

1961
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,712
In terms of relevant at this point 2013

1962
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:02,784
Alex doesn't rank with those other people that he's

1963
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,136
Just because

1964
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:12,512
Obama is describing behavior that is similar to what Alex does

1965
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:18,656
Exactly what Alex's

1966
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
Does not mean

1967
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
You thinking of

1968
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,800
I think I think

1969
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
Obama

1970
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,384
Has probably never cared about Alex

1971
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:32,736
He's not

1972
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,272
How awesome would it be

1973
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:40,928
Get high with Obama and watch Dreams of My real father.

1974
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:47,328
About Obama's dad being frank Marshall Davis

1975
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:53,216
That would be amazing

1976
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
Observe

1977
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,872
Think it's important to point out here

1978
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,920
Completely narcissistic

1979
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,224
And making everything about himself

1980
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
Intentionally

1981
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,528
It works for the

1982
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,136
He makes it very clear that

1983
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,160
He hasn't watched

1984
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,184
Any of these clips

1985
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,720
Isn't know what

1986
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:18,560
Is happening on whatever the staff place

1987
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,520
I'm sorry I didn't mean to

1988
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Does that start

1989
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,664
You know what I find

1990
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Does

1991
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
Correct

1992
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
Picks out

1993
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,064
Going to

1994
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
Do what

1995
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,952
I mean Obama said other people

1996
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
Yeah

1997
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,816
He knows that's what he

1998
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Please do it

1999
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
Right

2000
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,120
Like he

2001
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,400
Possibly

2002
01:48:54,656 --> 01:49:00,800
Because of the only way we're going to make progress

2003
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,128
Constituents

2004
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,200
Understand the issue

2005
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,224
It's like

2006
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,552
If you weren't doing that

2007
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
Stuff

2008
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,624
If the people your listing work

2009
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Doing that

2010
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,440
They wouldn't be the first

2011
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,976
Names are out of your mouth

2012
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:23,328
Do you know what I mean I think you could probably rub but that by saying

2013
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,888
Like the reason that I thought of those people is

2014
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,704
Cuz they're the people who are demonized in the enemies

2015
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,472
The globalist

2016
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:33,312
Or something but even though flying back is generally

2017
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:35,360
Globalist shill

2018
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,712
I know what you mean

2019
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,480
I think

2020
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,552
I think it's actually

2021
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,880
Correct

2022
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:51,744
It would be a nail in the coffin

2023
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,512
I see what you said

2024
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
Variax

2025
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,400
Alex is getting really defensive

2026
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,960
About being on Piers Morgan and yelling at them

2027
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,776
Express

2028
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,568
Because it wasn't a good space

2029
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Kind of debate

2030
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,896
Because

2031
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Deserved it knows

2032
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,968
I wasn't there that conversation

2033
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,272
Now

2034
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,552
Healthy Start

2035
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
King

2036
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,088
About it

2037
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,624
He decides that he's got

2038
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,672
Come up with an example of a

2039
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,000
Conversation negotiations debate

2040
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:33,472
Where where is mine goes

2041
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:50,272
How are you doing today

2042
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,320
First of all his neighbors

2043
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:57,696
Don't do it

2044
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:01,024
F*** it it's Jessie

2045
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,096
The debate

2046
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,936
No

2047
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:11,776
This is actually conversation I've had

2048
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,080
Specific means

2049
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
Absolutely

2050
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:18,688
I want to make notes

2051
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:22,784
Considering converting is land to agricultural use to skirt property taxes

2052
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,088
He's got to be talkin about acres of land

2053
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,904
He's working with cuz otherwise

2054
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,440
Secondly

2055
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:32,256
He's absolutely talking about a conversation

2056
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:36,608
You definitely had with his neighbor Jesse about committing tax fraud

2057
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:41,984
According to Texas Comptroller's office in order to qualify

2058
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
1

2059
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
The land must be

2060
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,896
Currently devoted principally to agricultural use

2061
01:52:55,040 --> 01:53:01,184
Agricultural land must be devoted to production data level of intensity that is generally accepted in the local area

2062
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:04,512
That seems unlikely again

2063
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,912
Bee plant but local

2064
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,704
A little bit honey

2065
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,984
Tiny bit

2066
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:18,592
The land must have been devoted to agriculture production for Italy

2067
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,128
7:05

2068
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,944
Unless

2069
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,504
Funny business to plug

2070
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,040
For the last half

2071
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:31,136
He's over 30 the criteria required for an Agricultural tax

2072
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:36,256
Alex seems like he's just talkingshit here together enough

2073
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,560
To actually get this plan in motion with his neighbor

2074
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,840
But if he did that is

2075
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,864
Definitely a text

2076
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:46,752
Actually follow through with it I'm just going to leave this here is an example of Alex being

2077
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,520
Very

2078
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
Very stupid

2079
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,848
But I do want to point out that when

2080
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:53,664
To come up with an example of a straight-up good-faith negotiation

2081
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,272
His mind goes to conspiring with his neighbor to get the IRS

2082
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
Yep

2083
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:07,488
No

2084
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,768
No it's

2085
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,304
Conversation

2086
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
Probably

2087
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:16,448
Call Tino

2088
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
Yeah sure

2089
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:20,800
That's his idea of what a debate

2090
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,824
I guess

2091
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,408
The only people who really

2092
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:27,200
Get hurt by agricultural exemption

2093
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:28,992
Open fraud

2094
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:32,576
Because tax dollars go away that need to be made up somewhere else

2095
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,112
Be passed down to

2096
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,648
All other consumers

2097
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:39,232
I've been also other people who rely on agricultural

2098
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,584
So I was really only hurting

2099
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,608
People he pretends to

2100
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,376
To support

2101
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:51,520
I don't know if he actually followed through with it and I don't know how I would ever find that out

2102
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,568
Short of leaving a blind item

2103
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:55,616
Anonymous tip

2104
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:58,944
With the Texas comptroller and I don't think that's worth our time

2105
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,992
How about

2106
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:01,760
We put out some

2107
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,040
On the Craigslist

2108
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
Connections

2109
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:07,136
I don't know I saw you you lived next door

2110
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:11,488
We were going to wear Alex about emergency

2111
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
Just gets lost

2112
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:17,376
In a hole thinking about how exciting

2113
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,168
Is that Obama is talking about him

2114
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:23,008
But you notice

2115
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:51,424
Really really

2116
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
Really

2117
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,384
Rearranged

2118
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,688
Really

2119
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,736
I didn't even want to be the most

2120
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:08,832
Popular really Alex real homecoming

2121
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:16,768
Yeah I need a Wonder

2122
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,304
That wasn't that was

2123
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:25,216
Entirely wrong

2124
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,080
I'll just get through this next one cuz it's

2125
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,104
Making the argument

2126
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,152
He's the main person that Obama was

2127
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,880
Respond

2128
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,000
Syracuse the main

2129
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:50,304
Center of the group of people

2130
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,840
Is responding

2131
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,120
Intuit afraid of

2132
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:56,960
Partially undoubtedly believe all of these things

2133
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:03,104
Together it's because Alex has entered impeachment articles

2134
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
Attacked as soon as

2135
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,920
The press conference

2136
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:07,456
Press conference where in

2137
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:10,784
Ski specifically is talking to Alex

2138
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,904
Reminder reminder Obama had to address

2139
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,928
Alex because

2140
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,696
Alex's

2141
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:18,976
Move on

2142
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,536
Petition got over 100,000

2143
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
Yeah

2144
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,888
It was real proud

2145
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,776
Another consideration

2146
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:32,800
And

2147
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
We would like to

2148
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,592
Officially tell you to go fuc

2149
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,152
Yeah yeah yeah

2150
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:37,920
This

2151
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,224
He's one of those things

2152
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,808
Coming from someone who stands to gain a lot of money

2153
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,368
By creating the perception that the president was

2154
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,392
Responding to him

2155
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,416
And all this

2156
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,952
If that wasn't

2157
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,000
I would

2158
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,536
See this as a mental break

2159
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:58,144
I would see this with a as a break with reality because it's all building

2160
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,936
Blocks of something

2161
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:03,008
It's very profitable to Alex

2162
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:06,336
It really kind of just feels like artificially could

2163
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:07,104
Instructed

2164
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,176
Things that would be scary if they were sincere

2165
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,456
I don't think those

2166
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,480
You know it

2167
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,040
Listen to his voice

2168
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,088
Sounds

2169
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
Giddy

2170
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,696
A President Who

2171
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
Talked about

2172
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,768
No longer sounds good

2173
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:25,792
When

2174
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,840
Trump a president who likes

2175
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:28,864
Talks about it

2176
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
Do you know what I mean

2177
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,168
I don't think that

2178
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:34,752
Diddy thinking about Obama talking about him I think he's

2179
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
Giddy

2180
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,568
Think about all the publicity

2181
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:43,968
Yeah the Optics required

2182
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,760
You met that Obama is talking about

2183
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:48,064
Obama's accidentally

2184
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,368
Given Alex all the ammo that he

2185
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,648
You need to do

2186
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:59,072
Years of shows quite frankly

2187
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,864
But the best thing

2188
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,144
For him would have been

2189
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,936
Hillary Clinton

2190
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:06,752
Saying stuff like what Obama just said right there

2191
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:11,616
Hillary said they got a dark heart

2192
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,664
A really long time

2193
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,272
Reflection

2194
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
Actually sincerely believing

2195
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,344
Did Obama is direct

2196
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,368
We talkin to him through the

2197
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,416
That's a line that I think

2198
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:27,232
Is kind of important because otherwise

2199
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,280
I do think that we could be

2200
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,560
Like looking at something

2201
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,840
It's kind of scary

2202
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:37,216
Either way but it's

2203
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,264
I mean scary on lyca

2204
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:43,872
As opposed to a scary what

2205
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:44,896
Into the world

2206
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,688
Rhetoric

2207
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,736
Earlier I scolded

2208
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,040
You were suggesting that it

2209
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
Possible

2210
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,600
That Alex really

2211
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,392
Kind of just want his gun

2212
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,672
To fight off a

2213
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,952
I don't know some

2214
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:05,120
Be mirrored in lot of coded language

2215
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:05,888
Did he uses

2216
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:07,936
Falcons

2217
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:09,728
And I was just

2218
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,152
That is

2219
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:49,920
Pretty

2220
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,760
Also I love the beginning of that being like what

2221
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:57,344
Isn't that the premise of your career

2222
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:02,464
What is that a new revelation your head

2223
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,792
Also why are you creating this bizarre nonsense about him

2224
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,072
Impeaching a president

2225
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:13,216
Keenly aware that he's just a front man for the f****** globalist going to do

2226
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,776
Come on have a good time

2227
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
Bulshit

2228
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,104
You know what maybe lose

2229
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,432
Maybe lose the complex maybe the

2230
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,504
Which is a totally thing

2231
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,832
You know what

2232
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,904
If you're going to go down you might as well go down with

2233
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
He's president

2234
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
You know

2235
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,720
I guess

2236
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:43,168
It does feel that way

2237
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,240
A lot of those feeling

2238
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:48,288
Behind

2239
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:51,104
Unacceptable code

2240
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,896
I'm at now

2241
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,432
I could be generalizing with

2242
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
But when somebody

2243
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,272
The right

2244
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Is welfare

2245
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,624
They are

2246
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
Yeah totally

2247
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
No totally

2248
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,096
Let's call it 9

2249
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,424
Clip Alex

2250
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:18,496
Call from a guy

2251
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,520
South African

2252
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,336
Mickey's a bad dude

2253
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,272
Consequences

2254
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:33,088
Cover to cover

2255
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:36,672
Email my copy to Barry Hussein

2256
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,696
Highlighted

2257
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:44,608
Yourself

2258
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:45,632
He might get killed

2259
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:48,704
For sending Obama a copy of this book unintended

2260
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
The callers nuts

2261
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:56,128
But the longer answer is that course he wouldn't be killed for that sort of a gesture

2262
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,152
But

2263
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
He knows

2264
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:03,552
Implied death threat that you'd be making to Obama

02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,928
Book written by a guy named John Ross

2267
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,768
The book is pretty hard to get a copy of it

2268
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,792
Super expensive

Able to read it

2271
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,168
Just a discus

2272
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:20,192
The colors

2273
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:26,336
Comic book

2274
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:29,408
Militia p***

2275
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Pure and simple

2276
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:37,088
All you really need to know about this book is it the consequences that are unintended are they

2277
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:41,440
Civil War or unhappy with the government's meddling

2278
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,232
Was what I was

2279
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,256
Thinking

2280
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:48,608
Book have threatened 100% Alex Jones Jackman

2281
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,936
The novel tells the story of Henry Bowman

2282
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,544
I'm Shady ATF agent

2283
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:03,200
He does this by pulling a gun on an FBI informant at a gun show

2284
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,480
To get revenge on Henry

2285
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:09,344
The ETF somehow gets convinced to set Henry up but because Henry very smart

2286
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,136
He gets the jump on them when they're coming

2287
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,160
His house

2288
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:17,024
Everybody I've read the book is

2289
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,304
Very graphic

2290
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,120
But how he tortures and then kills the ATF agent

2291
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:24,704
Who are specifically described his quote

2292
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,472
Cultural

2293
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:31,360
Really one African-American female cop who shows up at his house is named gonorrhea

2294
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:35,712
Ross is all about

2295
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:38,528
As well as what kind of person would think this is annex

2296
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:39,296
Flint book

2297
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,088
Like Alex's describing

2298
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
Wow

2299
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:42,880
That

2300
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,928
Henry force is one of the agents

2301
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:50,048
A recorded confession video which is definitely a false confession in reality

2302
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:50,816
Probably

2303
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,096
To be Enrique

2304
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,376
How wrong he was

2305
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,168
Henry precedes to decapitate

2306
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,056
I want to play this game

2307
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:09,504
Burns rats van and shoot some helicopters out of

2308
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,552
Guy before meeting up with his buddy

2309
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:13,344
Start a war against

2310
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,368
The feds

2311
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:17,440
Leaderless resistance model

2312
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,208
Like

2313
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,744
What people

2314
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,024
Thought red.

2315
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:21,792
Was

2316
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,584
When in reality Red Dawn was

2317
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,680
The opposite of that like Red Dawn was supposed to put you inside of

2318
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:33,568
Snow people

2319
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,616
You would do and why it's

2320
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:36,384
If you think

2321
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:39,200
This is reasonable absolutely reasonable for 8

2322
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,736
America

2323
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:44,320
Kenter doing it to other than empathy

2324
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,344
Gross

2325
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,952
White people what if we just started being terrorists

2326
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:53,792
It is kind of bad

2327
02:05:58,656 --> 02:06:02,496
They post a false confession video

2328
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:07,104
If people begin doxinate

2329
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:15,552
Henry makes a declaration that all 80s members cops or elected officials

2330
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:20,416
Those were against their interpretation of the Second Amendment is guilty of treason and subjective

2331
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,232
Multiple Congress members are murdered

2332
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,512
Henry's friend

2333
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,304
Cindy was a victim of sex trafficking

2334
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,840
Henryettan AA meeting

2335
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:29,632
Decided to start prostituting yourself

2336
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,960
For Henry every very likely

2337
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:33,728
We killed her pimp

2338
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:39,104
Murders happened before his running with the ATF

2339
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,384
Some kind of a peace-loving

2340
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:41,408
This is bulshit

2341
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,432
Ouch that hurts

2342
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:47,808
He was a good man with push too far

2343
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,600
Already a mass murderer

2344
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
The Chiefs

2345
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,280
He's the bad guy

2346
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
Yes

2347
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:02,400
The rest of the Patriots

2348
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:05,728
Ultimately concluded with the Patriots with the presidential

2349
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,496
Negotiate

2350
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,544
Hey which point they force him at gunpoint to read

2351
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:10,592
Executive order getting rid of all cop laws

2352
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:14,944
Plot is grossly childish. Just

2353
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:15,968
Grubs

2354
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,600
A lot of the reviews I've read

2355
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,136
It seems

2356
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:25,184
Like he really

2357
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,720
Sickly

2358
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,512
Describes the murdering of the

2359
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,280
Cops

2360
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,584
Seems to relish it quite a bit

2361
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,144
Here are a couple of Interest

2362
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,192
Pieces of the book that I think are worth

2363
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
Discussing

2364
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,496
Outside of Justice

2365
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,776
Simplistic childish

2366
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,848
Militia p***

2367
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:49,504
Over the course of the story being his friends live through some real-world events like Ruby Ridge and Waco

2368
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:58,464
In the text these events happen is there in the

2369
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,024
Communities not actually happened

2370
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:04,352
So there's a weird historical revisionism

2371
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:06,656
It blurs the entire narrative structure

2372
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:09,216
The story happens in our world clearly

2373
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:11,520
Play because there are events that happened in our world

2374
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:13,312
But the Patriot Funhouse

2375
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,592
Mirror of reality

2376
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:16,128
Is the only point of reference

2377
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:20,736
In many ways it's kinda like his book exist in the reality that Alex Jones

2378
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,760
Creates on his program

2379
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,832
Yeah distorted Twisted version of historical

2380
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,160
Revision wear these

2381
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:34,560
A pro-gun people have always been the heroes in every single way

2382
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:39,424
This book literally and by name calls out

2383
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:43,520
Support for gun owners for America and Jews for the preservation of firearm

2384
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:49,152
2 gun groups Farber extreme than NRA who were both early sponsors of the Alex Jones Show

2385
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,528
AR-15

2386
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:56,832
Awkward

2387
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,600
The president

2388
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
Baby would be a rat

2389
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:05,536
I don't think you would but it is

2390
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:09,888
I'm a thread on that an AR-15 Message Board as two people I didn't recommendation

2391
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:10,912
A books similar to

2392
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:15,776
Pretty much all the responses are to read enemies foreign and domestic

2393
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:19,360
A Trilogy of books written by regular Alex

2394
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,128
Matt Bracken

2395
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,176
Who predicts a race war

2396
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:27,040
The writer of this book fictionalized characters

2397
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,600
Support the same organizations that support Alex

2398
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:36,000
I didn't join communities the most similar book people can come up with was written by one of Alex's regular associate

2399
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,560
Notice small overlap that we're seeing

2400
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,888
A lot of the rhetoric and a lot of ideas

2401
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,704
In this book are very similar to things

2402
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,728
Alex

2403
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,800
Fields

2404
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,080
Wrapped

2405
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:51,616
LARP

2406
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:52,640
Like this

2407
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,200
It really feels like all of the

2408
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,272
Are living

2409
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,064
Role playing

2410
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,088
Because

2411
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,368
The real life

2412
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,904
Doesn't do it for them

2413
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,184
You know it's

2414
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,304
Two people who've left

2415
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,840
This

2416
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:15,424
Andre.

2417
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,216
They tell the same

2418
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:21,312
Feel like I was important

2419
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,080
Feel like

2420
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:23,872
Personal

2421
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:25,408
Control over all of the

2422
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:30,528
Dr. Wallach selling

2423
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,552
That's

2424
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:34,112
But a lot of what is preyed upon

2425
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:38,976
Resentment is a motivator and hope of a simple explanation

2426
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:41,024
As the drive-in

2427
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,048
Yeah

2428
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:45,376
What do other things

2429
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,216
Wind up getting them is missing that video games do and roleplay

2430
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:52,288
That is Starbucks peaches

2431
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,336
Well no not

2432
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,920
Is the idea of like

2433
02:10:58,688 --> 02:10:59,456
Leveling up

2434
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:01,760
Known for aggression

2435
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,064
Adele knowing the way that the few

2436
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:10,720
A linear path

2437
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:12,000
There's no

2438
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,280
There's no chaos

2439
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,680
Exactly how they

2440
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:23,264
Borders

2441
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,080
Which is actually

2442
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,616
You know

2443
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:29,408
I would say that is

2444
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,200
Incredibly

2445
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,736
Authoritarian

2446
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:36,832
You know what it is

2447
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:38,368
Piece of the story.

2448
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:41,440
They presented as his idea where the Patriots

2449
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:44,512
America

2450
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:49,888
There's no part of me that really believes that they're actually doing what people want

2451
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:54,240
Draft any Ledger

2452
02:11:56,032 --> 02:12:02,176
Debate over it now they held the president a small group of people who are enforcing their

2453
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:05,760
It's

2454
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:06,784
Not some

2455
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,344
Even the fantasy of it is convoluted

2456
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,880
It's

2457
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:11,648
It's very strange

2458
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:14,720
The day they are

2459
02:12:14,976 --> 02:12:17,280
Pizza miracle

2460
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:22,912
Inspired to go through

2461
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:25,472
Is Attack on the Murrah building by reading the Turner Diaries

2462
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:29,568
Well while waiting at his trial he got a copy of unintended consequences

2463
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,360
This is what he said about

2464
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:32,640
Quotes

2465
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,944
If people say the Turner diaries with my Bible

2466
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,992
Unintended consequences would be by Newton

2467
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:40,320
I think unintended consequences is a better book

2468
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:43,648
It might have changed my whole plan of operation if I read that one

2469
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:47,744
You're a bad terrorist

2470
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:55,424
Hey it's great

2471
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,704
Eighth grade

2472
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:01,056
Really

2473
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:03,104
Really what it was

2474
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,408
Look the content is bad but

2475
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,456
W

2476
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:09,248
Do you love

2477
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,272
The pros

2478
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,296
The pros is

2479
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,904
Disgusted by and really kind of scared about in the present

2480
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
With Alex Jones

2481
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:18,208
2019

2482
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,256
It's always been there

2483
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,816
It's just that the climate was

2484
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:25,888
I think about it a lot is kind of being crafty

2485
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,168
Yeah boys you know like

2486
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,472
Cthulhu's always around

2487
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:31,520
Until the stars are right

2488
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:33,056
He has to sleep in really a

2489
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:36,640
Unless the time is right

2490
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,664
For him to come

2491
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,688
Teach people

2492
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:42,272
New ways of enjoying and terrorizing

2493
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:44,320
And in the same way like Alex

2494
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:46,624
Is always been like this

2495
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,672
But the Stars weren't right

2496
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:51,744
The social climate wasn't broken down

2497
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,024
To the point where

2498
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,304
These conversations

2499
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,584
You'd be much more

2500
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:57,376
More overt much borax

2501
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,144
Accepted

2502
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,168
As public

2503
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:00,704
Speech

2504
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,496
It does feel like

2505
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:11,968
Novo

2506
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,296
Coming up in my mind never comes up on the show because

2507
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:16,320
The absence

2508
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,600
Do something in his rhetoric

2509
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,392
You haven't talked about Muslims

2510
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,416
Really at all

2511
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:21,696
In 2013

2512
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,768
He hates them so much now

2513
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,840
I don't hear him complaining about Muslims at all

2514
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:31,424
The only times I've really heard it come up where I gasp

2515
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:33,216
Calling Obama

2516
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:37,312
Double R Ranch

2517
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,592
He doesn't

2518
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,640
As overtly islamophobic

2519
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:41,408
Check back then

2520
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,712
Weird and I don't know what train is special

2521
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:46,528
Literally made a bunch of race

2522
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:59,584
Is been almost entirely absent from this

2523
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,680
Because in those rates

2524
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:04,448
Clips

2525
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:06,240
Add Muslims

2526
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,776
Time

2527
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:12,640
Just like even if he doesn't say it

2528
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:15,968
Probably

2529
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:16,736
On sublevel

2530
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:19,552
Dino from contacts

2531
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:25,952
Clues what are you talkin about

2532
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,488
America

2533
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:28,512
Call Emma Grimm

2534
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:32,096
So anyway

2535
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,704
Just do something more interesting Lee in the past

2536
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,032
Cuz I don't want to end the show on that

2537
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:42,592
Kind of

2538
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:46,432
I would prefer as Alex

2539
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:48,224
A Starship Troopers joke

2540
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,272
And then getting really self-conscious

2541
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:05,888
I'm not going crazy.

2542
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:13,824
No further word

2543
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:19,712
The very fastest book

2544
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:26,112
New York Times

2545
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,648
Plugging

2546
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,184
Jesus Christ

2547
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:31,232
Stupid

2548
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:41,472
I think that's one of the things I touched on earlier I thank you

2549
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,520
Sandy Hook is a meme

2550
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,544
To an end at this

2551
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:47,616
I'm not a already

2552
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:50,176
This move. Progress the narrative

2553
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:53,248
To the gun extremism

2554
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:55,040
To overthrow the president

2555
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,064
Impeach Obama

2556
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,880
He's taking it on the path that it needed to go on

2557
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:02,208
Which is probably the goal

2558
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,536
And then also make a lot of money selling to come and take it shirts

2559
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,888
Stream gun paranoia

2560
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:11,936
So I don't

2561
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:14,496
I do wonder how it's going

2562
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:17,056
Progressed from here

2563
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,872
It seems really

2564
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,640
Possible

2565
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,456
But he never needed to

2566
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,480
Do anything more

2567
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,016
I know he does

2568
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:29,344
Never talked about

2569
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,696
The hook again and I probably would have gone away

2570
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:35,744
I don't know why he needs

2571
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,560
Go back to the well

2572
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:47,008
Destructive personality

2573
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:49,312
Literally talk about

2574
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:52,128
Very weird

2575
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:57,504
Another episode where y'all

2576
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,136
It's knowledge.

2577
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:06,976
That's correct the Illuminati

2578
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:09,280
Nope

2579
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,816
Amazing seller

2580
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:15,168
Bike

2581
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,704
Bundles on Facebook

2582
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:19,264
What if you wanted to actually listen to

2583
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:22,848
We are on iTune

2584
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:24,640
Other places

2585
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,200
If your listen

2586
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,112
NBA Grace

2587
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:37,696
Theo Ratliff is blocked a lot of shots and killed a lot of Dreams

2588
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:39,744
I don't think

2589
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,120
Duxbury

2590
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,656
Never killed anybody

2591
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:48,960
Technically probably

2592
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:52,544
Holding

2593
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:58,432
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
