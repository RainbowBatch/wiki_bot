1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jill

6
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
But bright spot today Jordan was getting to join you on your stream of your video game

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,664
Channel over on you started playing Final Fantasy 7 is a lot of fun

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
I'm 22 and have very little to say

11
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,416
You are very offended when you do not have a sincere and large body of research with

12
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,488
From which to call Van challenge for me too

13
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Tear

14
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
About every guy

15
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
You judging other people think I'm not judging you I'm happy for you and I fully support you in this and all your endeavors

16
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
I do

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,664
Can't care about watching the stupid video game

18
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
I understand completely I also don't like it being exposed that I probably didn't beat the game though I thought I did

19
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
You can close

20
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
God

21
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Happy for you and

22
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
Congratulate you on the launching of your

23
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
You're a side project hair

24
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,592
Absolutely great how dare you act like you were so terrible

25
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Bored

26
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:33,344
I will keep my mouth shut light romantic difference

27
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
My bright spot Dan is today my partner is getting her vaccine

28
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,096
Teacher she didn't even have to try and cheater way in or lie to everybody

29
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
Anna getting her vaccine at the right time and I'm really happy

30
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,008
Relations

31
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
I hope that continues

32
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
Be able to get a 2020 to get around to podcast

33
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,368
She probably low on the list slowly

34
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
Play Fade Away I figure a teacher like you said obviously this is

35
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
In that in that line

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Much less so podcast

37
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Jordan

38
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
I'm glad I'm glad I wish you the best on your new

39
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Exploration of

40
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
Midgar you will remember me

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Jordans

42
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
Something to talk about

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,928
Episode 27

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,768
So fast this is Wednesday

45
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Of this week and the reason that we are sort of jumping ahead in time or last episode was about the inauguration

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
And Harrison Smith peeing

47
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Yeah

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592
Oh and the reason is hey I'm Alex Jones

49
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
I'm sitting around I'm thinking

50
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
The devil just got into the White House sure

51
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
The Supreme Court has just ruled that I can be sued by the Sandy Hook families

52
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm going to go on vacation man

53
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Leaves for Utah which is a strange place to go but whatever

54
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
I like that

55
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
The only tie every time he threatens vacation

56
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
He never takes

57
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
Vacation is when his lawyer that clearly said

58
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
If you are on the are you will say something that hurts Ark

59
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
You need to chill Utah

60
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
Rudy gobert

61
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,183
I don't know what he's doing in Utah doesn't seem like I've nothing against Utah State I love

62
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
The south-west quite a bit

63
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,583
Sorry I retract that is a good place to go on vacation

64
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
You know too many places are dry

65
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Alcohol

66
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Do that too

67
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
Slough dry county a lot of dry county

68
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
I thought you meant

69
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
No I did not

70
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,903
Studio and Owen Shroyer was hosting for

71
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
Number of days and I just don't care

72
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,791
I am so considering maybe like let's chicken

73
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
I just do

74
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,935
Smith episode Wednesday Alex hosted a good bit of his own show

75
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
With Owen Shroyer riding shotgun

76
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,103
God no no in the studio and something happened that requires our attention

77
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
And so we'll be talking about that today

78
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,503
And honestly I think that there might be a sequel to this

79
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
On

80
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
On Monday's episode of our show

81
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Is this appears to be

82
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
Something that might

83
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,975
I am going to fight a bear on Friday this week

84
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,815
Take away the bear

85
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Charity boxing

86
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:03,007
There will be a bare-knuckle boxing match

87
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,847

Alright weather alert

91
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
There is like a feeling that I have

92
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
Let me recording some Thursday and

93
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,047
I have some awareness of what happened on his show today but I

94
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
This is a narrative that scan

95
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Continuing continue into Monday show

96
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,751
Without giving too much away everybody was listening already f****** knows what I'm talking about

97
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
Anyway let's take a little moment before we get down to business Jordan say thank you

98
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Stouffer's

99
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943

Thank you very much my favorite of the

109
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Just a clam

110

Next Love's your podcast

111

Thank you so much trunk of the tiny hands of fate

114
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Journal about

115
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
I'm a policy wonk

116
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,775
That's a little of Mystery Science

117
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Your hands up

118
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Fake designer hands

119
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
That's to go along as a another plug

120
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Which channel

121
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
Mystery Science Theatre cutout already embarrassed

122
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
That's the goal

123
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
Doing something is a terrible idea.

124
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,231
That's trying to smother you with embarrassment

125
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Sojourn

126
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
Start off today on the 27th like I said this is all going to be on the 27th

127
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
Sansa Alex opens up the show

128
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
And he teases

129
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
What will end up being the reason we need to do this episode

130
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this January 27th

131
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
Wednesday broadcast Blackjack and we are going to have the

132
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Coming up on the broadcast today

133
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Daddy is appreciate what you're done coming on after I said some

134
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
The founder of

135
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,943
The founder or the leader of

136
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
The first thing that Mike Danna does when he gets on the show is correct Alex about this

137
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
Is like the disease of the book

138
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,535
I wrote down founder of the Boogaloo boys and then put gel

139
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
Scare quotes around

140
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
This this is something that's a little bit

141
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Murky

142
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
I don't think this is a good idea for Alex

143
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
You'll see why

144
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,151
Cuz he agrees with them on everything exactly like you did with David Duke

145
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
And this guy is a twenty-year-old Who

146
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Is

147
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Really

148
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
I would say he is more consist

149
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,463
Stephen Alex really tough to argue when you're out

150
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
Ends up becoming very embarrassing

151
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,167
I would say that we'd have not talked as much about the Boogaloo boys

152
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Who's on this podcast

153
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Because

154
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
It doesn't intersect with Alex as much as one might

155
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,871
Alex leaves them alone for the most part

156
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Except

157
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,783
A couple times he tried to use them to scapegoat things that their right-wing militias have done

158
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,135
IMDb situation with a capital

159
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
January 6th

160
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Is so large

161
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
And so important that it's

162
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Slide 28

163
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
Critical mass of throwing them under the bus

164
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:16,447
Employment papers and such don't come under attention

165
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
Right he wouldn't do too much

166
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Too I guess

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Point out

168
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
The people

169
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Who IRA

170
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
Basically he's running stochastic terrorism

171
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
4

172
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,343
You know like he's he's the one who's both giving them back cover of Life

173
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
These guys aren't

174
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Part of what we believe in while at the same time stoking

175
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
The ridge

176
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
So you don't want to be also like

177
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327
Boogaloo boys let's pay attention to them

178
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
It would be unwise

179
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
It's complicated for him to because

180
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,007
There is a lack of uniformity

181
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
With a lot of the Boogaloo community

182
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:58,943
He's right there is an embracing of antifa sometimes black lives matter

183
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,087
Or at least a loose accelerationism being the goal regardless

184
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
Some would say potentially performative

185
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
Collaboration and an acceptance of those

186
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
Indeed wing

187
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
Any that would be really difficult for Alex to explain to his audio

188
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
He's made such a

189
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Supermarket off of

190
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,639
Globalist devil bad Alex Patriot God good

191
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Go to

192
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
Have his audience understand

193
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
They're going there because

194
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
Bring some people in there I know I've called them all demon so they're trying to bring in the acceleration

195
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
I've gotten

196
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Some messages

197
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
In the past

198
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
From folks

199
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Who are into Boogaloo stuff

200
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
And they

201
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
Implore me to understand that

202
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
You know it's about guns

203
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
And gun rights

204
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Sure

205
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
Feelings that I have that I come around on it

206
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,439
Is I'm not going to judge any individual based on their

207
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
Liking to wear Hawaiian shirts in protest for the 2nd Amendment

208
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
But I'm also not going to trust them

209
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
Avery associate themselves with

210
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
A group like this

211
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Part of the reason for that

212
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
Is there have been enough instances in the past

213
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,359
Of people who associate with Boogaloo

214
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Iconography ideas the movement

215
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Doing things

216
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
That are meant to acceleration

217
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Protest

218
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
You do make

219
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Who's that that guy that that's sergeant

220
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,255
Who shot shot a cop

221
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
And then rub Bogen blood on his car

222
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,959
He was walking prior to this by using left-wing protest using the energy of it in their anger

223
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
For their purpose

224
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,335
There's been enough instances of that there's been all that discussion

225
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
And then

226
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Let's just f****** deal with the fact

227
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
Boogaloo is a reference to Electric Boogaloo

228
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Break into yes which is a Trenta

229
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,159
He was a mean back in 2012 about a second Civil War right

230
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
The organizing Central thing is a joke

231
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
What about

232
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Alright we're going to have to have a second Civil War

233
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Boogaloo is

234
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
From Alexa

235
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Civil War 2 Electric Boogaloo

236
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
If you are someone who just

237
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
Cares about people's Liberty and rights

238
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
And Second Amendment

239
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
And you also like to be goofy and wear Hawaiian shirt

240
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
I would implore you to not be associated with

241
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
The group that's name is derived from a joke about how we need a second Civil War and has spawned a bunch of

242
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Incredibly malevolent actors

243
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
There's nothing about this Hawaiian shirt

244
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
This intrinsic

245
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Take to the thing

246
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
That they seem to want to

247
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Push for

248
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
There's nothing

249
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
It just I don't know

250
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
It seems it seems like a bridge too far I just can't imagine being in 2021 and taking anybody

251
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
At face value

252
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Says

253
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Anyting Simba

254
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
2021

255
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
We don't take them at face value anymore

256
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Maybe you're a good person

257
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,951
Yeah plenty of good people who are Second Amendment people tons of

258
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
But if I took any of them at face value I would be an insane person

259
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
That's simply not a thing that we get to

260
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
To do anymore with Second Amendment

261
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
I would bet

262
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
That there are

263
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
Many individuals who consider themselves

264
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
Keepers that are decent

265
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Family

266
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Caring

267
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
That considerate people that aren't

268
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
The type that whatever Napalm bomb

269
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Right right right

270
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
But

271
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Still rare

272
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
True

273
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
That said even if that individual

274
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,583
I could see if possibly a decent person and I can probably get along with sure

275
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
I would not

276
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Align myself

277
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
With them politically

278
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
Right right to know that they were associated with the oathkeeper

279
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Because that's a deal-breaker

280
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
And I feel the same way largely

281
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
About

282
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
The Boogaloo

283
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,479
Yeah I know I just background check everybody

284
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:23,647
Just go back through their Twitter feed just going back to the

285
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
I don't believe I did that

286
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,535
So Alex does not want

287
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
A violent revolution

288
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
But he has against

289
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
The Boogaloo

290
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Which makes sense

291
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Are gearing towards like the inevitability of a second

292
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Kind of

293
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
Music makes no sense

294
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,735
Those are you out there

295
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
You're always the ones that are asking somebody else to do it

296
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,671
You're always the ones asking somebody else to do it

297
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
The weekend after the 6th

298
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,215
Alarm rcdc they'll arrest you for that

299
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
We didn't see the bugaloos show up armed

300
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
I don't know

301
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
I just don't like this thing about Revolution

302
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
And then.

303
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
People say

304
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Okay will you go first

305
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
There's so much in that clip there that just

306
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Contradict

307
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Alex's entire branding

308
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,071
He's saying that he isn't going to go first but he also spends so much of his time on his show yelling about Aries

309
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,631
The tip of the Spear of beer

310
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
The barbed wire to make sure it's safe for everyone else to charge

311
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,871
Filoli if you listen to Alex's show and believe a word of what he said

312
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,503
Also opposition to the Boogaloo idea of having our marches makes no sense

313
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,903
I went to the gun rights absolutist in the past he's been pretty clear that every American has a right to carry arms peacefully ever

314
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Probably approach

315
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:05,279
The idea that a certain group is being told that they'll be arrested if they March arms

316
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
To be a huge violation of his concept of the Second Amendment

317
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
And yet here he is saying that the Boogaloo types

318
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
Because the state told them not to

319
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,799
This is where it's important to recognize that Alex has no real concrete

320
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
Principles that he's working off of or else

321
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
His position here would be have to be

322
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,807
He doesn't have a principal believe in the right to gun ownership because like shooting guns a lot and he found it was a really marketable Niche to be a guy

323
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
Dial jelavic bread store support for gun regulation

324
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,023
True at the moment business requires that he actually be in favor of people you would normally called gun-grabber

325
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
And somehow this doesn't seem weird to a large portion of his body

326
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
Yeah I mean with your when your ideologies and your strategy is

327
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,407
Something weird happens and yeah you're going to get into some real uncomfortable

328
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
It does appear that way

329
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Someone else was uncomfortable situation

330
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,855
Is Donald Trump impeachment trial coming up

331
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
And Alex has a pretty good idea

332
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Iblog what he needs

333
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
To do

334
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
He's lost over 60 other platforms so he can be silenced

335
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Silence ahead of

336
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
And during his trial

337
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,519
What the presidents lawyers put on the defense

338
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
On the witness

339
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
And let them know about him

340
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,015
Always got to do is have a hit list

341
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Exhibits

342
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,879
He puts on and it will destroy them

343
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
Perry Mason

344
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
The whole system on trial please just please

345
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
I would like that please take that advice

346
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,727
That is something that I would want that would be the first time that I have ever watched an entire

347
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Asthma trial

348
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
Keep on going man

349
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
It's a

350
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
I think it's Sound Advice We like Let Your lawyers represent you

351
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
Has a fool for a lawyer

352
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,415
Alex is really getting into this idea of a trump needs to get up there and low Bass

353
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,791
The the entire Congress

354
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
Right out of the real footage

355
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,079
Activities in a lawyer says have you no decency

356
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Annihilate

357
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
Really

358
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
This is their Waterloo

359
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
But of course

360
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
They're always aggressive globalist

361
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
We always we always act

362
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Where's the bad guys

363
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
We're on the defense

364
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
That be great the idea of trump

365
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
Like having Alex as his assertive representative in court I thought it was going to be the best you could be with

366
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
Trump representing themselves but now the idea of trump

367
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Represented by Alex Jones

368
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Has one-upped it again goddamn

369
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
It would be a zoo

370
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,735
Everyday I just I don't I don't even even imagine I would love

371
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:10,623
Zach famous quote you no sense of decency to pull out

372
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
That line was spoken by Joseph Welch

373
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
A lawyer who is representing the Army in case against Joseph McCarthy

374
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
McCarthy

375
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,119
Accuse one of the young attorneys working with well to being connected to the communist

376
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
And that is what prompted Welch

377
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
The question McCarthy's decency

378
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
The beginning of the quote is actually quote

379
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Until this moment senator

380
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your Reckless

381
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
SMS

382
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,687
This hearing was being broadcast on television

383
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
Send it the most essentially it destroyed

384
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
McCarthy's career

385
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
At least in part because it clearly exposed how much of a Witch Hunt McCarthy was engaging in

386
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Alex loves Joseph

387
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,071
McCarthy and thanks at the house on American Activities Committee was absolutely legitimate and they were doing the essential work of rooting out,

388
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
Alex shouldn't celebrate the lion have you no decency it's really confused

389
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Towards the guy

390
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
That's what threw me for a loop

391
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
Okay so he's saying he really could have

392
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
Taking it to

393
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Joseph McCarthy

394
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
See if you saying that

395
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
He couldn't be that lawyer right

396
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,879
Saying it to like Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer cuz I sent it

397
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
He doesn't understand nothing

398
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Things work

399
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Easy volcano

400
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
Something that should be like a deep wound

401
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Atlanta communist

402
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
Psyche you destroyed the guy who I think

403
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Or

404
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
Could have solved all of our non-white problem

405
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,592
Xscape we get one of the more unsettling

406
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
Ideas but Alex has

407
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,664
About

408
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
The Boogaloo

409
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
Types

410
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
And this is something we've heard him Express before

411
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,320
And it's kind of

412
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
It's a revelation that he

413
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
He kind of can

414
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
Tell whether or not a group is real or not

415
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232
By who they target

416
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay that's great

417
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
Because they believe they can tell our free society and submit their take over that way

418
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,752
That's why they're going to leave paramilitary groups there either

419
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
Unknowingly control because of their low IQs

420
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Lunch

421
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
The globalist

422
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
Please deadly vaccines

423
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
Battery populated states super unpopular top Global is Klaus Schwab

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Bill Gates

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Notice you never

426
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
About

427
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
Call the Secret Service from the president

428
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,448
To make you think they actually run time

429
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,312
Seem disappointed that people aren't making runs at Bill Gates alright alright

430
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Stone as a quote

431
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
I'm not

432
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,944
Kill anybody you know

433
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Yono

434
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
That's words that mean kill people

435
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
No that's it

436
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,208
Kill people for the messages

437
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
Absolutely clear

438
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
I'm not saying kill anybody

439
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,656
You know if you said if I'm not saying

440
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,776
Kill anybody I'm going to say I'm not saying kill anybody... And that's it

441
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Not

442
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
,

443
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
Because nothing that comes after that, is going to be anything other than Felisha guilty know the next Clause is generally going to be like

444
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
Or at least delineates like circumstances where the first caused by

445
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:28,768
Alex has called for violent revolution

446
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Just feel that way

447
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,448
So he's calling for even more is the Trump needs to turn this damn impeachment trial into a circuit love

448
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
We need to get that message from that message to him

449
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,104
He needs to go on the offense

450
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
Call the ostinato Biden

451
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,856
Omnipresent

452
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
He needs to

453
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,672
Just demand

454
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
Dominates

455
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
You can literally turn this whole thing around against them

456
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
If he doesn't

457
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,496
Bye-bye that he's been defeated I can tell he he he doesn't feel defeated

458
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
I'm pissed off

459
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
No they're not

460
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
This is like the same s*** he was saying

461
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,928
4 years ago

462
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Yep

463
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:36,352
They're saying like call just leave this alone and I will leave you with all that now there

464
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,888
It's just this is so

465
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Boring

466
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,824
I'm talking about his own feeling I know I'm disappointed to be in reruns of reality right now

467
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
This is really a bummer

468
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,664
You can almost feel it the way he is

469
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Did the manner of speech

470
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
He's just

471
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,832
Coming up with things that he Alex personally feels and applying them to Trump

472
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,160
Jack would like to yell at Nancy Pelosi

473
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,952
So strangely enough my advice

474
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,048
Trump is to yell at he should do what I wish I could

475
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Good deal

476
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Yeah

477
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
Big Cowboy news

478
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
Sure oh so it should be pointed out that Alex was

479
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,824
Jumped into the proud Boys by Gavin McInnes on are on what awards

480
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,152
Technically

481
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
That is true

482
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
Well Gavin was giving a little silly punches

483
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Yeah I think that's

484
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Action

485
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
Rufio panman

486
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Based Stickman

487
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,440
Gavin McInnes Alex Jones

488
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
Rambo Joby

489
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
What a

490
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
Murderers Row shitbag

491
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Haha

492
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
But there's news about one of the other members

493
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
The left is not create

494
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
Proud boys

495
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,040
The left doesn't know how to make memes as well as I do

496
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,368
Yeah I'm the meme machine if they called me

497
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
Yeah

498
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,672
Alright great

499
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,976
There was news that came out that

500
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
In the past

501
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,584
Enrique tarrio

502
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
I-Ready

503
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
These stories and I'm not sure that I see

504
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
C&E concrete

505
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
Indications that he still is

506
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Bright

507
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
And I can see that going either way

508
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,200
I am going to withhold any kind of

509
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Judgment

510
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,552
Or any Declaration on what his current behaviors are

511
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
Now I would say viralix

512
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
I might be worried

513
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Because Enrique Torres been on Alex's show a bunch

514
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,888
Winter time

515
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,936
I would say

516
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Metallic

517
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Might have

518
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
Or Joe Biggs might have

519
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Said something

520
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,640
But you wouldn't want to say to an informant

521
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
I don't

522
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
They probably didn't text

523
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
To to each other though dad

524
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,856
I don't know if that's the case and like I said I still need to see further

525
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Indication

526
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
To heal

527
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
At least

528
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
You know like convince

529
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Vicki was

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,120
Like snitching on the Proud boys or whatever

531
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,704
There's a problem for me this is this is what I'm talkin about with higher classes

532
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
Alright boys are also a really

533
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
Really bad at being a gang like

534
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
In Chicago

535
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:31,200
If you get taken up by the cops and you're in a gang man they just assumed you talk

536
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,016
It doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you talked or not

537
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
You can't take that risk

538
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,464
Sure so they can't you of course you say Enrico Thierry Andre guitario is an informant

539
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,096
You got to get him out of there you think if you're doing like security put probably yes

540
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
I understand making that likes her to safety position

541
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
Right I understand that

542
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
This is a gang

543
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,360
Punches you and make your name cereals to get in Idaho

544
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
Getting the message what I'm trying to say is that what I'm saying maybe our expectations for how tight a ship

545
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
They run

546
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
To be adjusted

547
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
They do not have a Stringer Bell

548
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
That is for sure

549
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,512
They laugh at Gavin McGinnis his jokes

550
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Not a good group

551
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Now that's not

552
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,680
Vaccine news also you have the vaccine news

553
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,264
But you mentioned up top I have good news yep I was just some other news

554
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
Hold it to vaccines

555
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
Major health problems are bad reactions

556
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
Both

557
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,760
MRNA vaccine in their regular

558
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
Those have been pulled they say it doesn't work and it's dangerous and you shouldn't take a vaccine

559
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
If they know the House of Cards is coming down

560
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
Alex isn't wrong about the underlying story

561
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Free here and I didn't think the Bandit

562
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,448
Attempts to create to experimental coronavirus vaccine to this week

563
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
However the message of the stories

564
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,056
Completely misrepresented by Alex into being anti-vax

565
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,640
In reality a story like this should give people even more confident

566
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,272
That's about the vaccines that are widely available because this clearly demonstrates that there are some vaccines that don't make the cut

567
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:17,184
These two that were developed by Mark are not the same ones that were made by Pfizer or Butternut so pointing out that

568
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Story of the way to make those

569
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
But that's exactly what I was doing

570
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
Houses also just lying when he says that Merc

571
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
Decided to stop pursuing these vaccines because of bad reaction

572
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
From NPR

573
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
Marcus Holt

574
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,080
Development of its covid-19 vaccine candidate saying that while the drugs seem to be safe

575
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,432
They didn't generate enough of an immune response to effectively protect people against the Coronavirus

576
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
So they're just didn't work

577
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,832
Mark spent a ton of money on developing these potential vaccine then ultimately it didn't work

578
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:51,488
The fact that this happens pretty regularly is actually an indictment of Alex's fictional worldview and it was really interesting to see him report

579
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Working on a story

580
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,584
Huge problem for his narrative as if it's somehow validate

581
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Yes weird

582
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
Yeah but the narrative for them is

583
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
If the system isn't working

584
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
The system isn't working

585
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,544
System is if it is working

586
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,824
Then the system isn't working

587
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Because if it's work

588
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
It's trying to kill you maybe idea I'd like I think it's more just like a sleight-of-hand thing where

589
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
These vaccines got recalled

590
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
How can you trust this completely separate tracks

591
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,744
I meant also just making s*** up the obvious thing for him

592
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
The obvious problem there is that is it

593
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Many ways is

594
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,864
Essentially the free market

595
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Working the way it's supposed to

596
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
They don't have a product they can

597
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
Can sell so they can't sell it

598
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
But Alex would believe that even if they did have a product that was ineffective because everything is about money the Run

599
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
A hundred percent right they still sell it even though it wasn't effect

600
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,296
Thanks so much money into it

601
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Jesus.

602
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
Incoherent world

603
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Anyway

604
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,464
Alex is going to get to interviewing this Boogaloo

605
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Gentleman

606
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
And

607
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Interesting

608
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
Because

609
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
I can't quite figure out where to place himself

610
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,704
Cuz he's like you do have a responsibility to over

611
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,080
Overthrow a government well he already said earlier I'm not saying kill anybody but you know

612
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,944
And that he may develop later I believe that this makes no sense

613
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Sax to me

614
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:21,088
I believe in Declaration of Independence believe that when we have a destructive government that have come after our freedoms and our rights

615
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,976
It's not just our right as her Duty

616
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
Defrost

617
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,656
I don't want to do it I don't want to be lead

618
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
My idiot

619
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
I don't want to go at the wrong target

620
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Exhaust

621
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Every

622
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
Form of

623
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,616
Artificial Warfare

624
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Politics by other means

625
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
Bismarck

626
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
Pen is mightier than sword

627
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Warriors

628
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Can't win with the pimp

629
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,744
You're not going to win the Pandora sword

630
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
I just

631
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,120
I don't understand what you saying other than kill my enemies

632
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
Yes because

633
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:12,288
He's saying that they like I don't want to be led by the Southern Poverty Law Center the abl that's meaningless that's just nonsense

634
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
But

635
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
The problem that he seems to have is that these groups

636
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
Aren't doing what he wants

637
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,504
That's a real issue

638
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
Because he says

639
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:27,904
But you have a responsibility to throw off his government once it reaches xynz point

640
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,512
His show is essentially all about how we reach xy&z point

641
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Ninety-nine percent of it yes

642
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Also the left is on create

643
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Those are its base

644
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
The two themes

645
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,568
He makes a career out of arguing that we have reached the point where it's essential to throw off the government

646
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
And then you have these people who are like well

647
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,760
Well you have a good career out of it or reactivate a career out of it you would be more

648
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Christian people actually do

649
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
Yeah probably

650
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Cuz there's not a money in that

651
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Navigate to the point where Mike Dunn

652
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
Boogaloo boys Jordan Air comes on

653
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
For the interview

654
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,936
And this note that I have right here on this clip is just as this is a bad idea

655
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Usually people who disagree with or no come on

656
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:25,504
Mike Dunn is a well-known Boogaloo boys

657
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
And so I will try to get them before the Restless

658
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
Log out my questions of my comments so you wants to

659
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
That is straight

660
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
All about folks that want to start a straight

661
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
None of that is accurate

662
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
It's funny to whenever

663
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:55,200
Owen Shroyer who's also their timing in periodically he

664
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,528
I was complaining about these other people who were too cowardly to come on it's like

665
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
Brian stelter

666
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:07,232
Also maybe the reason that he's coming on is because

667
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
Cuz he's not yours doesn't disagree with you

668
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,864
Stop saying that you guys are wrong

669
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Maybe

670
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,960
He recognizes that you are very usable

671
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:22,592
Yeah you are platform that is exploitable for his purposes

672
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
Which he could have learned

673
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Is a lot

674
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Easier than he might

675
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
I think if you would listen to our

676
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,808
Plated out exactly

677
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
So easy so easy

678
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,952
So Mike starts off like I said the first thing he does is correct

679
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
Alex about the leadership

680
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
First things first

681
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,328
I'm not I'm not

682
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
I'm just someone who's in the movement

683
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Alexace

684
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
But I just want to get that straight

685
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Buy me a time.

686
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Leader of it

687
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Simply

688
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
I control a large

689
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
Portion of it isn't interesting

690
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
I control a lot how long

691
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,792
Is the guy who there was a vice article and video

692
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
About him John

693
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
I believe last year

694
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,216
And it did sort of traces some of his Brute

695
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,288
From being a Virginia gun rights

696
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
Militia type

697
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Which if you were calling your guy Alex was

698
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
Super into

699
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
Loved it I've been through that he fell in with the Boogaloo communities and what-have-you

700
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Michael started with Mike Dunn

701
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,440
Dot-dot-dot or Mike fun

702
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
?

703
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
Understand

704
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
Hawaiian shirt emoji

705
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,072
Yeah it's so

706
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
He was involved

707
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,936
Prior to getting into the Boogaloo stuff and just a lot of stuff that Alex

708
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Super

709
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
Super into and capitalized on

710
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,336
The gun rights rally in Virginia that Alex

711
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,128
God talks about all the time

712
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,992
Some of the malicious stuff that that Mike was involved in was involved in that

713
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,552
I know it's almost like a lot of these

714
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Far-right guys are are

715
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,208
Almost giving these like exit interviews with these people like hey you did a great job

716
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
But we got to cut you loose

717
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
And I cut you loose I mean blame you for everything that we've

718
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
The flip side of it is like kind of don't meet your Heroes kind of kind of lesson

719
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,568
People are coming onto Alex's show

720
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,456
Second I saw you like that I thought you were great Alex but unfortunately

721
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Oh boy

722
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
Mike

723
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Mike is

724
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,368
I think he can tell that Alex is trying to set him up

725
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,976
Because Alex is trying to be a dick to him and I think it might knows that and

726
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Easy Millennial gen Z kind of guy

727
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
What's the weather called

728
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,496
But he's using you

729
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
And he's a he's a

730
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
She started with a quote

731
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,176
I want addressed as well

732
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
Find yourself here some other fudge from you 1776 the answer tonight

733
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
1984

734
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
She also said it just

735
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
People

736
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Be what I believe in

737
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
If they got motivated

738
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
And stop

739
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
Giving their political ideology

740
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Figure

741
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
They will figure out what they

742
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,448
We have been motivated

743
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Figured out

744
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,544
What we wanted which is freedom from tyranny

745
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,640
That when you say 1776 is the answer to 1984

746
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
And your involvement in the capital

747
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
I know you can

748
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Inside in the Bible

749
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Allison blah blah blah

750
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Feeding into the media narrative

751
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
See what they're putting up

752
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:58,144
Let's not putting articles up right now

753
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
Alex is giving him a lot of

754
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,568
I think it's scary over here listen to me when I talk

755
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
You're really not supposed to come

756
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
Back at me with things that I've said before you're definitely not supposed to use my words and ideas to justify your beliefs quora

757
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
Fractions

758
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Because

759
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,344
They are my words

760
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,208
Sound exactly like oh boy I'm in trouble now

761
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
I imagine that's his thought process

762
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Is just like

763
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
Oh no he used words

764
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,400
I wouldn't have done this interview is over Alex

765
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
I think this is a bad idea

766
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:38,592
He can do these gotcha moments like the Bill Ayers interview or David Rothschild

767
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,920
Just he's so bad at this

768
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,480
He's really good at steamrolling conman

769
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,296
He's not good at talking to people who are the actual

770
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,136
Beliefs I don't agree with Mike

771
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,928
And I don't trust him

772
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
I don't think he's being

773
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Necessarily

774
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,840
Aboveboard and fully honest even in this interview

775
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,144
But I do believe it has beliefs

776
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
More than Alex yeah I didn't have a problem handle it

777
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,080
Schlitterbahn almost certainly inspired by Ali

778
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
Yes send

779
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
He is aware enough to recognize the Alex

780
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
Doesn't actually have those beliefs

781
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
That's not good

782
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,832
1776

783
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
1776

784
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
March 2nd Americans begin

785
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Battle

786
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,104
27th we had the Battle of Long Island September 15th we have another bloody battle September 21st

787
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
New York City

788
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,968
October 11th we had another bloody battle that's just one of the many

789
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
Ancestors all 1776

790
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
76

791
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
I feel like you just for the merch

792
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Tire

793
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Lost Ark

794
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
Avenues that

795
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,704
Politicians who were there for the money

796
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Hot dog

797
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Infringe

798
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,664
It doesn't matter

799
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,856
Is it

800
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
People

801
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Even you

802
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
This is

803
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Or Alex wow

804
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
This is not good

805
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:42,496
No this is a terrible situation for him to be in because he's being rightly confronted about his

806
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Using Americana for Merch

807
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,152
And s*** that is a valid criticism to be levied against Alex

808
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
But he's also

809
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Being scolded by somebody who stands

810
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
What's 2

811
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,856
Deeper radicalized perhaps his audience

812
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,672
Yeah I'm interested in that

813
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:04,768
Push and pull because it does seem like they're Twisted motivations here for Alex

814
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
It's like one of course he has

815
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
To be Top Dog

816
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,424
But to he does want to give these exact ideas of Platte

817
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
True

818
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
To me is part of why he

819
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
He's not interrupting

820
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,104
Yeah it's hard for me to tell if it's like a way of

821
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,944
Painting this person has the Fall Guy but also at the

822
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
The same time as message

823
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:29,344
There is a part of me that feels like maybe that's what's going on but I also

824
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,952
I seen enough interviews on Alex's show that are just like he does not prepare

825
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,792
A tall idiot

826
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
Who didn't know anything

827
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Lake house

828
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
An awareness of Alex's career

829
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
Didn't have an ability to stand up for himself

830
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,800
Like I would bet that he's like I'm going to

831
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Talk to at

832
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
Queen

833
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
I'm a man

834
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Yeah it is

835
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,735
Really funny

836
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
How how

837
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,087
Completely clueless old people are

838
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,671
Considering the fact that I believe that

839
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,559
90% of 60 year olds are savvier and probably have a better education

840
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,911
You know like 123 I'm terrified you have powers

841
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,727
You know you guys don't even know what kind

842
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Play f****** Powers you have yet

843
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,335
Yeah and if you're not going to lose an argument to Alex f******

844
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,711
Punjab snow that it's pretty clear probably some

845
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
This this guy is not

846
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
What Alex

847
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,063
Expected I don't believe

848
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
Now that I take issue with other thing that I'm worried about is that this is a guy who

849
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,999
Stan's two

850
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
Be a negative influence

851
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
On Alex's audio

852
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,887
Stroking so much as there are people who are like

853
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,935
Gavin McGinnis or

854
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
Nick Fuentes or Michael Jones

855
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,543
To come on Alex's show

856
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Handstand

857
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
To take audiences on a different

858
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,127
Pass

859
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Take them from this

860
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
I mean it's bad but there's

861
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
Kind of a

862
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:00,991
Like

863
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
Hi guys like

864
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,599
An exploitative vampiric nature to Alex's just like

865
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,927
Keeping people scared and then selling them dumb pills they don't need

866
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
Like I hate it it's an awful thing but it is

867
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
It's kind of

868
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
I don't have a vested interest in them not going

869
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,119
Too far for the merch

870
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Yeah yeah

871
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:22,751
Falling into overtly anti-semitic communities

872
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,823
Starting to watch the American terminal

873
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,663
Things are dangerous and I I don't think

874
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
He is the right person

875
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,039
This Mike making these critiques of Alec right that are

876
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
Justified in finger

877
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Hey what are the reasons is like

878
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:43,999
Mike believes a lot of the same stuff that Alex does like that the election was a fraudulent one

879
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
We also watch Brave

880
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
We all understand

881
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,655
We're not Chop fans we're not fighting

882
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
Is that we understand that but

883
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Stability

884
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
We see it as they're hot

885
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
Rebelution

886
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,943
I just want to come to that

887
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,783
Justin Lovelace the people

888
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Previously

889
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
We see that as a way to say hey

890
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,951
What do attorney and we're going to stand against it

891
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
Where is 3%

892
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
How to say concerning

893
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
And and what we're about we're about freedom and liberty for all people

894
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,567
Discrimination

895
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
The Constitution

896
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
So I did this is a chance

897
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
It's to launder and sell this

898
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
This group as

899
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:46,207
I don't honestly don't even understand why he would say that as if it's a good thing

900
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
On Infowars

901
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
Discriminate

902
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
This whole thing is about

903
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,191
Discriminated man we're looking for

904
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
We ran out of boot

905
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
Now we are hoping

906
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,567
Somebody will come up who will El Paso

907
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
Suppress the people we want to

908
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
I don't

909
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
I don't know if I would agree that that's the vibe I get off mic

910
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
Sure

911
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,039
No I don't get that well

912
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
I mean

913
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
I guess

914
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
I guess it's that kind of

915
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Always

916
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,695
Getting to that conversation

917
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
Should have like you guys just don't realize

918
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Because you think

919
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
Think you're going to be the mine owner

920
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,631
You don't think you don't think that you're going to be

921
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
Under a different boot

922
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,471
You think it's going to be some sort of

923
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
Utopia where you get to do whatever you want

924
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
What to do and all you're doing is establishing

925
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
Someone else

926
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
To f*** you over

927
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Probably worse

928
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Yeah and it's also

929
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,183
Mystical reasons in a disconnected World why the Civil War in the United States in 18

930
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
60s didn't

931
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,743
Really lead to

932
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:58,143
Complete destruction of America another civil war to break out today

933
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
It's not like what

934
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:06,079
This fantasy is worth one side will fight the other event someone to win and then America

935
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
More in the

936
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:11,455
An actual Civil War do you think

937
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Thought that would work

938
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,783
Look for the other Global powers

939
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
That are like

940
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:22,975
Tied up and talked to me it wouldn't work majan that China and Europe

941
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Naturally they do

942
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,119
Have a massive investment in the United States continuing to function the same way

943
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,007
I imagine they would stand on the sidelines if all of the sudden the global economy where to go

944
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:40,895
Two groups of morons were addressed Road Blue on f******

945
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
Playing running at each other with knives

946
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
We need the economy in the entire world to get back online

947
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,975
Far range in consequences from this this this

948
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
This

949
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Yeah

950
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
Sort of Fantastical idea that they have

951
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
A real

952
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
Lack of Interest

953
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
In accelerationist ideas is like

954
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
Anyway

955
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
I really don't care I don't care for this this guy is kind of ideology

956
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,551
Or maybe him personally I don't know I don't know anything about him

957
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
As an individual except for

958
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
What keys

959
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Put out on like vices

960
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
But like

961
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
I don't know

962
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
I don't that

963
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,303
Yeah I find it hard to believe how many people

964
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Still believe that

965
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Like

966
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,447
A war in the a Civil War in the United States would have

967
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Two armies

968
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Opposed to each other

969
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
With two generals

970
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,615
All choosing which troops

971
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:49,247
We're right as opposed to regular beating like there's no middle ground in a war in the United

972
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
They're like

973
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
Street battles

974
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,391
In every United States city or explosion

975
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Everywhere

976
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
I like there's no like just

977
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:04,863
We're going to go fight you know and you know the quickest way to get the UN here to is prostitutes at

978
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,983
For you at involved man I'm sure Alex would love that

979
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Baby grape

980
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
So

981
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,335
Mike and Alex

982
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
Talkin about

983
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,919
Alex's ideas

984
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Our kind of

985
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Behind

986
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
What Mike is doing

987
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
Alex has a really tough time with

988
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
I'm just trying to figure out

989
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
Are these could you mention this

990
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Because I'm smiling

991
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
Civil Disobedience I believe

992
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Defensive

993
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Japan

994
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
What's the score

995
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,847
You're saying listen to my work my energy

996
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
You're taking from that

997
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:51,199
The idea of Revolution or armed conflict

998
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
Yeah no s*** that say that it took it directly

999
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,063
I'm just saying that

1000
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
That you carry

1001
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
Sometimes

1002
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
Look like

1003
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
You're just there to create merch

1004
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
And not ask

1005
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,399
About you do peaceful protesting and

1006
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Listen to Growing Up

1007
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
A 1776 Revolution

1008
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Or the

1009
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
I figure out whether

1010
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Talk show with your axe

1011
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,439
Understanding

1012
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
What will my Gillespie Harper Sinclair

1013
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,119
You're better believe I sell t-shirts and I sell product

1014
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
They want to shut us down

1015
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,287
They want to kill Art Online

1016
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
You guys were

1017
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Your shirts

1018
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,663
Hawaiian shirts

1019
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Infowars

1020
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
I'm a capitalist I'm not ashamed I didn't get gym point six billion

1021
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
Dollars

1022
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,159
Democrat daughters in George Soros

1023
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
What's matter

1024
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
I don't get any funding

1025
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,095
Oral-B Atlanta

1026
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
Are the Boogaloo boys volunteer for my security

1027
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
I paid for my security

1028
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
South Shore

1029
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,519
Meccapolis I am not ashamed of selling products

1030
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
But to be clear

1031
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,335
If we get to a point

1032
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
I think I got to be violin

1033
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,711
Then I'll do what I have to do that's why I'm fighting so hard

1034
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Call John

1035
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,343
Yeah that was good

1036
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,743
Suction cups

1037
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,863
Abandoned house with piano wire

1038
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,399
No we all know Ali

1039
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Alex is a paratrooper he's going to get in that parachute and he's going to land directly on top of the Capitol building

1040
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:59,455
He'll his way down I don't think about Alex Jones and that is he is a man who is not unfamiliar with stealth

1041
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
Where's the where's Rider made

1042
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,439
Yeah that's a little silly

1043
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,279
I do think that Mike has a decent point though that Alex

1044
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,631
The way he engages with his rhetoric in the way he behaves on air

1045
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,447
Does lead to a point where he has to

1046
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,775
Be honest with himself am I just being me talk show host

1047
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,359
Or am I actually trying to rile people up to 1776

1048
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
And we've heard Alex when she gets too hot music

1049
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
No

1050
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
Shadowgate comes out of the auto do any this year

1051
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
Yeah when the country is stable

1052
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,391
Or at least more stable than it is now

1053
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,975
You can get away with 7 theater to 1984 7

1054
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,279
1576 everybody gets that it's a metaphor

1055
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Now

1056
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
It's automatic four

1057
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,703
You can't say it without meaning it

1058
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
Because it's happening

1059
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,383
Yeah and your use of it as a metaphor is part of what normalizes now

1060
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,431
In the same way that Mimi jokes

1061
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,711
About

1062
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,807
Boogaloo Civil War Electric Boogaloo

1063
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
Well people actually want

1064
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,951
To engage in ways that I could set off second Civil War like a jokes

1065
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
Can lead to action in

1066
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Maybe jokes replying

1067
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Yeah. Now we can't do this like

1068
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
Nora what I really meant was

1069
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
No specific

1070
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,751
Be careful in your language

1071
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
And make sure that everybody's f***

1072
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Troy

1073
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,431
It would be helpful

1074
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Guess what

1075
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,295
Hundreds of thousands of people are ready for 7

1076
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
1376

1077
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
Maybe milk

1078
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,183
And they're surprised that you're not exactly

1079
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,255
So now this is the point in the interview I think Alex realizes

1080
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
I better be mean to the

1081
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
This guy I've got to condescend to him

1082
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,935
How do you see this thing unfold tell me tell me

1083
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
General George Washington 2.0

1084
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
I don't know I thought you were the

1085
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,943
And revolution

1086
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
Tell me

1087
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,135
Freddy with a bill of particulars of what we want and then we go to war

1088
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,143
Tell me tell me what we do General General done what do we do right now

1089
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Go for it

1090
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
It does

1091
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,263
Papers in order

1092
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
Plan of government

1093
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,103
And actually get it done is start building forces

1094
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,223
I think that Alex thought he'd be cowed by that yelling

1095
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:46,623
I think that you thought you'd be intimidated by L200 outburst

1096
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,439
Okay well let's get a plan in place and take a right

1097
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,487
Oh no

1098
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,071
Oh I thought you were just going to be stupid Mike is saying essentially

1099
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:59,423
My part in this is right rising up in bulk

1100
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,215
That is what I have been doing

1101
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Great

1102
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,823
We need those bills of particulars

1103
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Why are you doing

1104
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:11,199
Yeah yeah absolutely he's like

1105
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
I guess Alex was expect

1106
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,831
Acting him to reveal himself as stoop

1107
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,879
And reveal that

1108
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,951
Look at all your stupid ideas that don't make any sense

1109
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:25,535
And then when he didn't reveal himself as stupid he has to try and portray him

1110
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Stupid

1111
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
And now he realizes that

1112
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
Eats in pattern

1113
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
You know like

1114
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,263
This is a generation well-raised on my generation zirin

1115
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,311
Destructive

1116
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,639
Well it's impenetrable for Alex also because

1117
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,455
The only way to penetrate it is to

1118
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Sort of

1119
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:49,087
Also puncture your own mythology and your own

1120
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879
Worldview

1121
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:55,231
Are you to say like We complain about is b*******

1122
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
Wrightsboro reason that you want the bill of

1123
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,839
Particular is in a

1124
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:04,959
New government and all this is nonsense it's all eyes that we've been spouting for years on the radio

1125
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,543
Now that you could do that and then

1126
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,127
Devolve into a completely different conversation

1127
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,735
Mike is essentially Bulletproof on a lot of points because he's talking

1128
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
Alex

1129
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
He clearly knows Prophets

1130
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
You don't put it on a certain press

1131
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,159
And he would stand to lose those profits

1132
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
If you were to do the

1133
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Thing that would

1134
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:32,607
Deflate this conversation I don't know why people who are going to absolutely be

1135
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,399
Beat the s*** out of Alex in an interview

1136
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
Do not bring a hype

1137
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:41,311
So many different lines in there he said where somebody should be on the call to be like

1138
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,735
And it and this would be a good place for it actually cuz in his next clip

1139
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,807
Like kind of choose italics Outlook

1140
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
They say

1141
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
Strawberry salsa

1142
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
We disobeyed it

1143
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,839
If they try to wrestle

1144
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
What are use the Second Amendment the way there wasn't

1145
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,215
Where did you do this

1146
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,823
This is in Richmond Virginia

1147
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,943
So we go there for

1148
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,503
Still

1149
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,575
To make sure that things are peaceful

1150
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
Andres

1151
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,159
Disobey the law

1152
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,695
We stand against the tyranny

1153
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
And what we see

1154
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
People like you Alex

1155
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Have you talked to her

1156
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,495
Speeches but y'all do actually sending this morning as a Young Man

1157
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,311
A young American and someone involved in the Liberty

1158
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Equalism

1159
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,943
How am I not standing its tyranny

1160
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,991
Evil legislation marching

1161
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,783
They're going out having a bit

1162
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
Because you because you talk

1163
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,647
Disobey

1164
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
We we stand there or we're not

1165
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Like a lot of

1166
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,303
Republicans do we actually stand up

1167
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
That's what I want

1168
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
What's the revolution look like

1169
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
Well there you go

1170
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,215
Austin

1171
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,495
Civil disobedience

1172
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
They decide

1173
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
The do something

1174
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
They will Santa get

1175
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
When I say hey

1176
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
You can open carry

1177
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
Disobeyed

1178
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,831
Walnut

1179
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,839
Repeat that was so weak

1180
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
Alex

1181
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,423
Sinatra but I don't know

1182
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,775
You can you can honestly imagine somebody who likes Alex

1183
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Text hearing this

1184
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,615
And it's shattering some of the illusion you have about Alex

1185
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,431
As him being a competent confident

1186
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,223
Strong force

1187
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
This guy is

1188
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,551
Mirroring back a lot of Alex's rhetoric

1189
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
Better pointing out the

1190
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Places where

1191
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,671
It's clear that Alex is

1192
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
In contradiction with himself

1193
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
And it's so

1194
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,815
And he's hammering the fact that he's in it for the merch

1195
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,351
Utah

1196
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
You talk you talk for money

1197
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
That's what you do

1198
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,263
Likewise

1199
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
If there is to urinate then

1200
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,871
I'm halfway waiting for this to end

1201
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,151
You like about molyneux

1202
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,967
Declaring himself a white nationalist warehouses just like well

1203
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,015
I guess I'm a book a little boy too

1204
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:33,087
I didn't know it but here we are

1205
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:39,999
Good like you said I mean you could tell there was a little bit of submission there are out show Das

1206
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,583
Dollar

1207
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,167
And so Alex has to retreat to try and get have got your moments

1208
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
So he brings up the capitol

1209
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,031
The Strategic blunder of rushing into the cat

1210
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
The Strategic blunder

1211
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,639
Of the selfies in the cute art stuff

1212
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:01,759
And all the rest of it dammit

1213
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
You think whatever the capital was a victory

1214
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,671
Or Fiasco

1215
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
I definitely think it it was the right thing

1216
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
Thing for the wrong reason

1217
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,327
I think it was good way to make government to the people again

1218
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
It was nice

1219
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
Members of Congress

1220
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,679
Fearing the people

1221
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
I think it was right thing for the wrong reason

1222
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,103
So you know wish that people wouldn't have knocked on the doors and Awning

1223
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
I Wish Your Heart

1224
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Percent that

1225
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,343
So that's a little bit so f***** up yeah

1226
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,415
Yeah there is nothing quite so terrifying as a zealot

1227
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,999
Urolift

1228
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,071
A lot of historical problem

1229
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
20 year olds

1230
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
Kia

1231
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:56,031
Is also limiting his own personal involvement with the capital

1232
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
And the storming of it

1233
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,871
Boone article in Reuters from January 8th

1234
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:06,271
Groups of loyalist under his command

1235
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Help

1236
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,343
Storm the capital this week amid a Motley mix

1237
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
Writers who supported President Donald Trump

1238
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,463
Attempt to overturn the results of the November presidential election

1239
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:20,351
Well most boogaloos are Libertarians who largely opposed Trump done said the group embrace the moment to strike

1240
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Against the government

1241
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,935
So I don't know like it if this

1242
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
Reuters article is wrong

1243
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,055
He downplays his own involved

1244
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:34,175
And there might be some disingenuousness on his part

1245
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
In terms of his exact action

1246
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,551
I just don't think that you can get away with commanding

1247
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,575
Sing people to

1248
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,367
Overthrow the cap

1249
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:47,231
It seems it seems like this Reuters article if true is a

1250
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Yeah

1251
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
That's I don't know

1252
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Yeah I don't know

1253
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,167
I do know that that is a point that Alex really hope

1254
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,751
Would show some sort of weakness on Mike's

1255
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,055
Point Park but no he stands

1256
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Sperm donor

1257
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:05,151
What are you got a consistency

1258
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,295
And I'm not saying that it's a positive thing

1259
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Yeah yeah

1260
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,671
Owen Shroyer is there like I said and he pops his little head in

1261
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,719
Say hey

1262
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,743
The Bible

1263
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,791
He indicates that stuff

1264
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,071
I like it I like it

1265
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,887
Should we could do it later

1266
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,471
Alex you can tell is getting a little heated

1267
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,311
There's no doubt that we have encroaching Global government there's no doubt

1268
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,615
Out that the government out of control

1269
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
At the biggest

1270
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,455
Crooks in America are in Washington DC

1271
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,503
90% of Americans would agree to that

1272
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,551
Here's the problem though

1273
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,855
And ended my God I'd like to get you responsive

1274
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,391
We're not in

1275
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
A 1776

1276
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
Colonist versus the British government time

1277
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
We're hiding in the woods

1278
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,119
And we got the local communities and and they don't have a World Tech

1279
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Technocracy

1280
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,703
Set up against the us or a federal government set up again

1281
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,287
I've been to jail multiple times for my free speech you know that

1282
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,895
So I mean to sit here and say nothing cuz you didn't stand around Hawaiian shirt with a gun

1283
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
Hello

1284
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
Alex

1285
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
Alright I'm not going to just let these two young dickwad

1286
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,415
Talk around me without me just starting some dominance and Alex's being a real dick

1287
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,279
I feel bad too bad for Mike but like

1288
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
You know I can tell

1289
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,863
He's being rude being rude

1290
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,679
I am not winning the war of ideas

1291
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,983
Invited this guy

1292
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,031
I was just being a dick to it because

1293
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,055
He's failed

1294
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,639
The upper ground

1295
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,711
And in this argument as usual he's pouting and throwing a fit

1296
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:48,831
Return to this team's like if you were real

1297
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
You would kill my enemies

1298
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
I'm telling you

1299
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
The target

1300
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Boogaloos are real

1301
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
He's been calling for the Council on Foreign Relations

1302
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
Every member

1303
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,423
Ricardo

1304
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,983
The last thing I want anything

1305
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
Original Australian

1306
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
You are

1307
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
Not endorsing

1308
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Him

1309
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,535
But you are saying

1310
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
If you take out my target

1311
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:38,495
I like you I will consider you real

1312
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,591
Expected of being sprockel run

1313
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,895
False flaggers

1314
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,735
If if only you did Kill Richard Haas

1315
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,063
I'm not telling you that I want anything bad to happen to Bill Gates

1316
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
But

1317
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,159
But I am going to use

1318
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
The same

1319
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
Visual metaphor

1320
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
That was used

1321
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
In the war on terror hey you know you you said

1322
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:13,055
I asked you what the plan was and and you came back with it should be my idea and my ideas

1323
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Is that you should take out these Target Osha Thai minute aren't I

1324
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
Oh no

1325
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,199
So

1326
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,479
The proud boys

1327
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,807
Under the bus

1328
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Does not

1329
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:32,511
Look like they are going to be heroes

1330
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
He saying that he still supports

1331
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Cowboys and Levi butt

1332
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
He is a proud boy

1333
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
He's now lumping them in

1334
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
With forces that might have Act

1335
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
Did you know good

1336
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,311
Enrique tarrio

1337
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,663
Time I want exposed the federal forces that are involved in this

1338
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,247
Identified boogaloos identified problems

1339
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,551
Leaving me attack on the capital thank you

1340
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,903
All this out today before this broke about tarrio

1341
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
Google is Wesley Chapel

1342
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,607
Ugly boy

1343
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,031
I'm going to ask you right now

1344
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,127
Building

1345
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
DC is the capital

1346
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
Capitol building

1347
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,015
Okay

1348
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Alex's big gotcha is

1349
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:35,487
Is a tweet or maybe it was both on parlor I'm not sure but it's Mike saying that they have for fireteams

1350
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,511
Ready capital

1351
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,303
And

1352
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,119
Well I don't know I didn't actually see the tree but

1353
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:46,751
It makes sense that his explanation is ouimet the country's capital is not the building

1354
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,823
Sir sir there to where I know they are homophone

1355
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:54,431
Yeah they sound the same

1356
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
Four teams inside

1357
01:05:56,735 --> 01:06:00,575
The building we were talking about Bain Capital we went to the wrong build

1358
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,647
I am really sorry about that be how quickly that guy

1359
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Gets resolved

1360
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
I was talking about the

1361
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,815
Yeah and he was correct about it too we didn't find assemble he was just like

1362
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,095
There's a difference

1363
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,679
But Alex has blamed

1364
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
The bugaloos

1365
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,239
People

1366
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:24,639
Who were the ones that like the zip tie them to the ones that are really scary

1367
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,943
Capital the Patriots

1368
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Vicky

1369
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
Prove these things he's not just

1370
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,135
Because this interview isn't going well

1371
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,951
Alex kind of reveals that I I'm just looking

1372
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,231
For someone to blame

1373
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
Decided it was you

1374
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,119
Here's what we're going to find out who these guys were in camera that mask on

1375
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
Is on trial in a week and a half

1376
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,079
We're pissed off about it

1377
01:06:54,591 --> 01:07:00,735
He wanted to put peaceful pressure on them to show our numbers

1378
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,295
You hear the headline

1379
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Po-boy

1380
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Yeah

1381
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,719
That is not what someone would say

1382
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,327
Nope I approve it it's a bungalow boys and we're going to find out who did it

1383
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:20,191
And I think they work for the FBI

1384
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,847
We're going to find out we're going to get to the bottom of this if I ever told you about how I'm a psychic based on

1385
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,127
People

1386
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:35,295
Body language expert but I can tell from skills photographs God gave me a vision

1387
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,927
30 years ago that laid all of this out for me Mikey or not really fitting into this vision

1388
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
Confused

1389
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:47,071
Did you might be working for the Devil by

1390
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:54,239
I don't understand why he doesn't end every interview that doesn't go well with like obviously you're working for

1391
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
For the devil sir

1392
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
And I must have you off

1393
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:01,663
Obviously this is a challenge to the devil has thrown my way and I just

1394
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:10,367
The devil took Jesus into the desert for 40 days and 40 nights it on night one Jesus said

1395
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Now I'm out

1396
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,975
Did you know that the devil is actually a book boy

1397
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,767
I did not know it's proved that

1398
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
That's fair

1399
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:23,935
So like I said Alex is claimed that he's proved all these things when he's talking about it on his show it's not like

1400
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
Spitballing ideas

1401
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,775
Talking about we have Define

1402
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Trinity proof

1403
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
That sources have confirmed

1404
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:37,247
The document everything that it was antifa and booger

1405
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:43,647
You folks got tricked into going and taking selfies and the Patriots were doing the right thing

1406
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
But they got overwhelmed

1407
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
Oh yeah

1408
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
So

1409
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
When you hear clip like this it

1410
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
It's just like

1411
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,191
This is not this isn't congruous

1412
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
How to say it

1413
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,079
I said this

1414
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
I don't think they're racist other stuff

1415
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,735
We know they are probably not wearing their outfits not wearing their you

1416
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Perform

1417
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
We have tweaked by you

1418
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,623
And in other people saying they stop

1419
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
The capital of tack

1420
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
That was the right thing now you're kind of

1421
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
Halfway back

1422
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Cool

1423
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
The question is

1424
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
I see this doctor

1425
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
4 Gold lady

1426
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,167
Hi-C

1427
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Brandon straka

1428
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
They're doing nothing

1429
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:37,151
Freaks me out

1430
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,199
Clubs

1431
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
That's my big question

1432
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:48,927
Alex if he knew what was going on and he had the information that he claims to be would not be trying to

1433
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,231
Figure out who the provocateur groups are

1434
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,327
Do not be having the alleged leader of the book Amazon

1435
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,679
And being like well we're just trying to spit ball and figure out who did what

1436
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:04,031
Also there's video of Brandon straka inciting a crowd to

1437
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:10,431
Casteel a cop Shield was doing was nothing

1438
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967
Pikachu

1439
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
Barely anything

1440
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,111
What is it look if he was in my hometown

1441
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
Princeton Illinois

1442
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:25,279
Nobody would be bothered by it

1443
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,607
There is that that's hard to understand cause and effect

1444
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,399
Brandon straka go to prison

1445
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
You know cause and effect

1446
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,007
This is really just the way we perceive entropy in the universe

1447
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,799
Self sure

1448
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
Yeah yeah

1449
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,383
And I think that

1450
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,455
At this point interview you can really tell that Alex is done

1451
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
He's been defeated

1452
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,807
He's bigger than have the energy it's just no good

1453
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Doyoung

1454
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
You can see Mike Dunn

1455
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:53,439
I'm a little concerned I see this going on I'm worried about

1456
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,279
The idea of your movement that anybody can send her a Boogaloo it's like

1457
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
Are you for anonymous

1458
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,119
Ru42 anybody's b-42

1459
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:07,775
Don't you worry them are you frantically that's what it came from

1460
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
Are you worried about being taken over

1461
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615
What is actually happening here

1462
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
Audiology

1463
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
Boogaloo

1464
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
Several people started

1465
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,911
Liberty is for all and we're done

1466
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,263
Yeah and it's a joke meme that turned into an ideology about

1467
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,311
Be need for a second Civil War

1468
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
So

1469
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,127
I don't think

1470
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
I don't think we can sort of

1471
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,223
Eliminate that and pretend that that's not a p

1472
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
Piece of piss

1473
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,039
I think that's fairly important but

1474
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:55,135
Alex signaling defeat there just being like well you know look I'm just

1475
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Trying to tell you that your group can be co-opted

1476
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,231
That is an attempt to trick

1477
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
That is a

1478
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
False

1479
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,815
Move backwards

1480
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,887
Into AAA proposal submission

1481
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,959
It's a sidestep more like yes because then Alex

1482
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Tries

1483
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
To get him

1484
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,031
Do

1485
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,151
What's it called what's the pleading the fifth

1486
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,015
Open Chrome Alex is trying to get him to self-incriminate

1487
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
Here's my issue

1488
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,207
Are you guys putting on a Manifesto of Target because

1489
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
Directions to sheet of what

1490
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
The people should be in control of

1491
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,983
What about Bill Gates what about

1492
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Tell me

1493
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
2003

1494
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,991
Why who's the extra space for you guys

1495
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,343
It would be a courtesy here and released a Manifesto

1496
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,183
The real evil King

1497
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:13,471
Malicious

1498
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,519
Golden people understand

1499
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,079
Oh baby

1500
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,479
Listen what I'm telling you is I want to save this country

1501
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,527
Okay this is the Spider-Man

1502
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:30,111
This is Spider-Man

1503
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:37,535
The bad guy or the bad guy

1504
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:43,935
A stupid idea I'm not going to do that.

1505
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
What you are

1506
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,727
Oh my

1507
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,543
That is so funny yeah

1508
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
Man

1509
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
God bless

1510
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
I mean like God bless

1511
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
No I don't have a appraisal

1512
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,991
It's a it shows some wherewithal

1513
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,039
Look for Mike to recognize like

1514
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,623
Talk like this

1515
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,927
He's a good I would say next move

1516
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,511
Sure if this was Bobby Fischer vs. Kasparov

1517
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:15,167
I'll be like nice move in or it would be an unnecessary error

1518
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,215
To continue the chest metaphor

1519
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
So Alex

1520
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
Pink

1521
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
He also

1522
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,383
It makes it a little too obvious in this conversation

1523
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
That this is person

1524
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
Like this really feels

1525
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Personal

1526
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,063
In this clip Alex is going to express that by way of being like

1527
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:37,183
Hey I'm the real person fighting for Liberty Shore and you can prove that be

1528
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Because

1529
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:43,583
A bunch of people are suing me anyone suing you

1530
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,375
I want to save this country

1531
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,471
Running around storm and capitals

1532
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519
Either intercourse

1533
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
What's the country

1534
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,127
Do you have 50 lawsuits

1535
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
What's again

1536
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,015
You have the Democratic party financing

1537
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,719
Why am I under so much taxes I know nothing

1538
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,791
I'm this coward I do this cuz you were piece of s***

1539
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,839
You're this cuz you are all the gun

1540
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
Oh my God

1541
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Fall down on my knees

1542
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
It's the fact that you

1543
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
The only thing is

1544
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
I am not doing

1545
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:42,463
I'm not Democrat

1546
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
They're scared of it

1547
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
People swim cap

1548
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
French Revolution and I always will

1549
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:06,527
Alex is trying to again incriminate him he's trying to get him in this thing where it's like all you told people to start

1550
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:13,695
Like afterwards Alex can still use that for his narratives if you get them into that box right and not least of which he wants the

1551
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
This guy emoji

1552
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,023
Yes he wants this guy to be like

1553
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:24,447
Did tell people to storm the capital of being like that all you guys aren't you were engaging

1554
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,727
Taking the same sort of s*** that

1555
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,311
Achieve any of the goals you professed to have

1556
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,871
And we're going to force a revolution

1557
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:36,735
Not that idea there is the accelerationist ideas before sir evolution

1558
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
He's not

1559
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,063
Something that

1560
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,647
Is it it's not what goes well with

1561
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,975
Public facing idea of

1562
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
The Boogaloo

1563
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
Types

1564
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,071
Want you to think like all weird

1565
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,863
Just here standing around making sure nothing

1566
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,143
Gets out of control

1567
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,959
Because you want to force Revolution

1568
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
Yeah

1569
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,311
Like something to go bad

1570
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,359
Right and people start shooting

1571
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,407
I think one of the

1572
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:09,759
Most difficult things for Alex's he doesn't understand that their agenda

1573
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
Begins with Rebelution

1574
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,575
There's no like

1575
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,903
I don't think they care what

1576
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
Brexit

1577
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:21,023
If it was a left-wing cause they would be like yeah let's go

1578
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,327
The revolution is what their goal is

1579
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,631
Yeah you can't really be like

1580
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,703
Oh see you're so stupid it's like no

1581
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
We just didn't succeed

1582
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,799
The goal is still a revolution

1583
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,359
We're not changing our goal because we lose

1584
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Yeah

1585
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,455
And I would say that based on this reporting and Reuters

1586
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
If accurate

1587
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
Is counter to what Mike

1588
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,831
Is presenting

1589
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,647
Here

1590
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,439
Some question about that I don't

1591
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,999
I don't know what the reality is I wasn't there

1592
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:57,887
But it does seem to be like at least a reason to be like I don't think that you're above board

1593
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,935
I don't think you're being honest

1594
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Now

1595
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,519
Here's where things turn a little bit more hot

1596
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
Alex brings up

1597
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,871
That the Boogaloo types

1598
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,431
We're trying to get a

1599
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711

01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247

End bike personally

And is

1606
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
Accusing Mike

1607
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
Of trying

1608
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
To get people

1609
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,815
How to do an arm March while they sit back and watch

1610
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119

Go to DC the weekend for the 6

1616
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,455
You guys didn't show up

1617
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
Other people

1618
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Coming to DC

1619
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,111
Just said that

1620
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Is it the word

1621
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
Brother

1622
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,047
Oh I thought so you're not going to respond

1623
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,863
I've gotten messages from you

01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
Like this is

1631
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
This is falling apart

1632
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
Yeah

1633
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
Alex's conflating

Other Boogaloo people

1635

And this guy personally

1636
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,343
The guy calls it out that you're saying that I did this

1637
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
If I didn't do that

1638
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,183
Alex realizes I got s*** I did

1639
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,231
I just got called out on that slider

01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,583
Hey if you were going to the splc tangentially

Week 2

1648
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,688
So Alex now goes out to break

1649
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,992
He thinks he's wanting a little bit

1650
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,576
He thinks he's got some win back he says he's made some suggestion

1651
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,880
And then he also got Mike to say

1652
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,208
That an armed march on DC a week after the

1653
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,024
The capital would be an unwise strategic move

1654
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,608
And somehow this is hypocritical although I think Alex agrees

1655
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,656
I don't know what's going on anymore

1656
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
I have said that

1657
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,360
Oh good good for you I remember the Boogaloo said

1658
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,920
You just said

1659
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
I'm a coward

1660
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
Fast action

1661
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
Wise action

1662
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Police Department

1663
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:04,256
Told me earlier that we should not follow the law you said I'm a coward I follow the law

1664
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,560
You don't fall off cuz you're a revolution

1665
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
City Council

1666
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
We Belong

1667
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,104
Local cops are issued

1668
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:24,992
Lordship

1669
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,832
You're that laughing cuz Alex thinks like you've got a daughter

1670
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
I finally got them

1671
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
I don't think so

1672
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,280
Don't think you got anything there now I'm very I'm very bored with this conversation

1673
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:41,888
Yeah I'm annoyed by it it sounds way too much like I owe you f******

1674
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:48,800
Philosophy 101 course where they're like

1675
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
Essentialism

1676
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,104
And it's like you're both

1677
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Stupid

1678
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
I don't appreciate

1679
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
And this is even worse

1680
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,272
Because you guys are not arguing about philosophy your life

1681
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
How do we kill all the

1682
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:04,160
I think I think that I can relate to what you're talking about in that I think

1683
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:04,928
Stupid

1684
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
Santa frustrating

1685
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
Conversationalist

1686
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:11,840
But I do still think there's an important

1687
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
Okay well we were talking about how to kill

1688
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:21,056
You're also seeing just yet another example of how

1689
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,848
Ecosystems that have been

1690
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,640
Spawned by people like Alex

1691
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,176
Have now out ground

1692
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,712
Them to a point where

1693
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
They

1694
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
AR

1695
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
Able to embarrass him

1696
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Yeah

1697
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:40,256
The Young and the Old Dan is always going to go it does feel a bit like that

1698
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
Play theme of that

1699
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
They come back

1700
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,632
Is that Mike did not leave

1701
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
After hours

1702
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,936
Routinely insulted him

1703
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,984
Suggested that he went to the splc

1704
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,872
And pays the favor by blowing up one of Alex's narratives

1705
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
It makes it clear that antifa was

1706
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,456
Not at the Capitol

1707
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
What I said was I would not incur

1708
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Inconsistent

1709
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,520
Who's the guys in camo are that Lidia

1710
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,824
And then get a few maybe 180th

1711
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
Let you know there are

1712
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,464
Not going to show you that

1713
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
They were not in

1714
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
Somebody point fingers at

1715
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,424
You're failing when your point

1716
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
They were not

1717
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,264
Oh I'm sailing even though they arrested antifa leader

1718
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,080
He brought 100 there I saw a bunch of skinny jean guys

1719
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,384
Helping do it also this was Altra paper

1720
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,176
That is it called

1721
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
It's nice

1722
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Oso

1723
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:17,280
Okay so should Trump be arrested for inciting this

1724
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Probably

1725
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,352
I think there are a lot of other crops

1726
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,080
So have you ever met

1727
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
Livertox

1728
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,992
A lot of people like

1729
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
Oh and you want to put both hands on that I mean

1730
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,840
Dude giving up

1731
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
DF

1732
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
A second time

1733
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,216
Have you been to the splc you talk to them

1734
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
And I just

1735
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
You got anything

1736
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
See now that's

1737
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,872
The problem with getting that brief moment of victory

1738
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,664
It makes the gut punch loss

1739
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,432
All the wars

1740
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
Yeah

1741
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:15,392
Doesn't do much better it starts talking about now that Trump is out maybe there's stuff

1742
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:21,792
If we can do now we can organize against war and this actually makes

1743
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,120
Brings up Mike having a decent point and that is like

1744
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,912
Could have done that before

1745
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,080
Surveillance against

1746
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,456
Let me ask Lord Boogaloo do you agree with that Lord Google Earth

1747
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
You're cool with it

1748
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Tyranny if it's a

1749
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,600
If you like which would be

1750
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,464
Rebelution

1751
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
Said somebody is in

1752
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Weather

1753
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,400
I just talked about all of us unifying is forcing oculate

1754
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,336
You said for the buried their own

1755
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:10,176
I didn't stand around with up with a with a gun in front of stuff

1756
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,016
Another cheap shot mister

1757
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:20,928
William fireteams in the capital wing wings

1758
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
Come on

1759
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:28,352
Don't get mad

1760
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:34,752
I want to complain about cheap shots and he keeps calling him Lord Boogaloo and like

1761
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
Mister Dog.

1762
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,592
Oh mr.

1763
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,408
Now that would have been too far

1764
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,944
Wow you ended with mister

1765
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
You're dumb

1766
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,040
Beer today talking about

1767
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,344
Unity and unifying

1768
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
I'll get together with folks and we like

1769
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
Fight against the war and all this

1770
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
And Mike

1771
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Which point is

1772
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:59,072
Pretty fair that's like well you had no interest

1773
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,352
In reaching

1774
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,912
Out to any other groups when Trump was in office

1775
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,704
You weren't concerned

1776
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
With what inroads

1777
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,312
You can make with cooperation because that's

1778
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,104
The Tyranny that you enjoy

1779
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,920
Yeah

1780
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,248
I don't want coming from

1781
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,528
Do you know

1782
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,112
He's essentially saying your belief system is in Coke

1783
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:26,976
Did Alex is proving it and Alex is trying to say his belief system is going to come here at

1784
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
And he's proving that it's not

1785
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,280
Is there

1786
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,560
They're awful

1787
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,096
Yeah all of them are awful

1788
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:37,472
But when you have a coherent belief system it and you are in an interview with someone who doesn't

1789
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
They're going to be like a wave on the mountain

1790
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,056
You know you got enough

1791
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,616
Totally misses the point

1792
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,944
Mike was trying to make about how like oh yeah all this stuff

1793
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:53,600
These real problems that you could have found a common cause with some other group that may be politically disagree with

1794
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
You know inter

1795
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:57,184
Person any kind of unity before but now you do

1796
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
Yeah because Trump

1797
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
Is not at office anymore

1798
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
He completely misses.

1799
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,424
Republicans across the border people who identify as

1800
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
Is that your offer

1801
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,968
Administration

1802
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
French

1803
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:29,184
Mike Mike

1804
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,744
That's exactly the point that Mike is make

1805
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,304
Exactly

1806
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,144
How can you both call for Unity now and then proudly say

1807
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,240
I would never work with black lives matter

1808
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,800
Because I haven't we what was I saying

1809
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,848
Boogaloo

1810
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,896
More more pejorative

1811
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,944
So

1812
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,040
We've already seen a couple of instances of Alex trying to paint

1813
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,344
Mike is a Southern Poverty Law Center

1814
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,952
Collaborator

1815
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,000
What was that the question

1816
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,888
What comes next in the Boogaloo universe or is there no

1817
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
First Urology

1818
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,216
Who creates is the high priest

1819
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,264
Who creates the audiologist

1820
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,056
Does it just flow forth from where

1821
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,408
It's autonomous and the next thing is Unity unifying the

1822
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,456
Bodysuit

1823
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
Running to us through our

1824
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,136
Government officials

1825
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,696
Is unify most people and getting ready to

1826
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
And physically

1827
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,048
Liberty

1828
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
Well

1829
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Yes I have

1830
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,112
They like asking questions at all

1831
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
That's all and I don't like giving a mess

1832
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
Ask yourself

1833
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
If that pays good picture for you.

1834
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
Well I just think what happened

1835
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,120
At the Capitol

1836
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,912
Ruin the great thing we

1837
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:23,104
I was really hoping to blame you for it wow

1838
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,408
You have been to go in circles around me

1839
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,992
I guess you're an FBI informants or maybe you're working

1840
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
For the FBI Idol

1841
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:33,088
Do you think Alex

1842
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,672
Expected some caginess or some non-answer when he has to talk to the FBI

1843
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
BFDIA

1844
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Coming for me

1845
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:46,400
Voluntarily and loudly calling for a revolution

1846
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,752
I've talked to them and the only reason I've been murdered

1847
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,288
So Mike

1848
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
At this point has

1849
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
To clarify

1850
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
To Alex

1851
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,384
Because I was just trying to pretend

1852
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,176
They they are

1853
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,968
Global anti globalist

1854
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:02,016
Because they don't Target the same people that I

1855
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,808
Driver killed Bill Gates

1856
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,368
And told Mike has to clarify

1857
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,440
New World Order

1858
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
And I miss goes

1859
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
Way off the rails

1860
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,328
The capital is a symbol of us voting justices be

1861
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,680
The New World Order

1862
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,008
Bill Gates

1863
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:27,360
And Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds the new

1864
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,552
They would be having the HRT swaps teams will be coming after your ass

1865
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,160
What about Cedric

1866
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
I need to control this.

1867
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,352
What do we stand against

1868
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,592
Assistant

1869
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
But these people are legitimate

1870
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,536
Netgear people

1871
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Their people

1872
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
Different

1873
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:24,704
But they don't work for the CIA

1874
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
CIA sources

1875
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
We are legit

1876
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,432
I'm controlled opposition

1877
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
I'm control

1878
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
That's why you

1879
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
Anything besides

1880
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
Pizzaland

1881
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
Legal

1882
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,280
Awful wonderful

1883
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,072
Dory ways to protest

1884
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,960
And then there

1885
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,312
Literally

1886
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,104
From which is not the

1887
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,640
Look at my

1888
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:07,200
I take orders from God that's it

1889
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
You fired the one

1890
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:11,296
That was David Knight

1891
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,344
Opposition

1892
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:18,208
Ono Ono

1893
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:23,584
Once again

1894
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,424
Bad HR decision to come back to haunted house

1895
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,776
I never thought I'd hear that said and seriousness

1896
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:37,920
Twenty-year-old Boogaloo boy coming over like you're controlled opposition cuz you fired David

1897
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
Boy

1898
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
Eboy

1899
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Yeah

1900
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:47,392
A man if only if only this is the one time where is he at

1901
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
Just listen to that

1902
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,488
Cbp's broadcast he could have just been like

1903
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,072
Steve literally said he's been manipulating you this

1904
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
Entire time

1905
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,376
Yeah you're so easy

1906
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
Horse your control.to opposition

1907
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,776
I don't know I think the term

1908
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,544
Is loaded

1909
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
Oh yeah

1910
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,224
Take the term controlled opposition is so loaded because

1911
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
Implies

1912
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
Like state

1913
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
Control or something

1914
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,112
I don't I don't know I don't

1915
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,392
See compelling evidence

1916
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
But Alex is like working for the feds

1917
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,208
There's something like that

1918
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
He is

1919
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,280
Unreliable

1920
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,304
Opposition

1921
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,864
It maybe not controlled opposition

1922
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,632
But he is

1923
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
Persuadable

1924
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:39,360
He's influenceable bye-bye people who play games with his ego and protect

1925
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
Regular

1926
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
His sense of self-importance

1927
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Closer things that

1928
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
Are real

1929
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
The real soft spots

1930
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,552
For him and

1931
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
Steve such a good

1932
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,672
I would be interested to know if we discover a new

1933
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Thing that he's so we

1934
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Week 2 which is

1935
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,512
Being

1936
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,792
Belittle

1937
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,840
Being forced to like

1938
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,144
Like do you think this is going to make him

1939
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,168
I have to be like

1940
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:07,520
Wolfine I will act more aggressively in order to look all these idiot

1941
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
I don't know I mean like

1942
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:15,712
You would think that our show would be a part of his is psychosis

1943
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,528
Made a career out of it later like him

1944
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,832
He's not trying to he's not trying to impress

1945
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,416
You know it that that's something I was thinking about

1946
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:27,232
Particularly dangerous about this or something that makes

1947
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
Is it more difficult for Alex

1948
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,560
Is that like if he had

1949
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:35,424
Somebody who is like an antifa person on he could berate them and humiliate them

1950
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,216
Bike hit the pause button

1951
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,008
We can't really do that

1952
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,544
That to somebody who

1953
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,568
Has

1954
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:45,152
Credibility in the right-wing world in in quotes

1955
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,432
Like somebody who

1956
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,736
Might have access to an audience

1957
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,504
Of

1958
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
Right wing

1959
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,040
People

1960
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,576
They could like Alex

1961
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,112
Yeah I mean

1962
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
It's a weird

1963
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,672
Weird thing from

1964
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,488
Pop up into my brain but I was just thinking about how

1965
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,304
In World War one of the big issues with

1966
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
The

1967
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
Chinese command was that

1968
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,168
The higher-ups didn't want to lose face

1969
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
In front of there

1970
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,984
Subordinates

1971
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,520
It's weird driving

1972
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
Overall policy

1973
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,104
By having this hardcore stands

1974
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,896
That was imparted upon them

1975
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:21,248
By the leadership and then the leadership realizing that

1976
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
They were f*****

1977
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,088
Couldn't then say like okay we're f*****

1978
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:27,904
Because the subordinates would be like you got you guys are a bunch of

1979
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Cowards

1980
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,208
So we created this kind of

1981
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
Feedback loop

1982
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:34,560
Run more extreme elements were

1983
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:38,144
Even though I sensibly they were under the command of someone else

1984
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,192
They were the force that was driving Thomas

1985
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,496
That sounds like a right way

1986
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:48,384
So Alex has been called controlled opposition and he did not take kindly to that

1987
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,224
This is Owen cute

1988
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,016
And

1989
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,552
He tries to a guy

1990
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:01,696
Say we're all friends here we all went out of the silent Revolution

1991
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
We walk

1992
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,744
Fast but

1993
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,304
We got to do it later exactly that's his older

1994
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,864
I've been arrested for my peaceful protest

1995
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,144
I'm calling for

1996
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,752
We have to awaken 50 million 100 million 200 million American

1997
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:18,848
Before you can ever even think about doing a finger like a violence in this country

1998
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,128
And have a chance of victory

1999
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,152
That's all I'm saying

2000
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:28,064
Doesn't matter we done some good radio

2001
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,088
Well-spoken person

2002
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
What you're saying

2003
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,976
And so we'll continue to watch the situation I was in.

2004
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
That's all I can say but

2005
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,400
Hilarious

2006
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,704
I'm independent

2007
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,520
Independent

2008
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
You're mad

2009
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:51,872
Also I like the idea that he's

2010
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,968
I'm not going to take cheap shots after an hour of cheap shot

2011
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,528
I'm personally offended by

2012
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,320
Him saying that they did great radio

2013
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:06,720
Absolutely

2014
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:10,304
I will save it as somebody who listens to ton of Infowars

2015
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,840
I think it was

2016
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:12,864
At least

2017
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:13,888
More interesting

2018
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,168
Sing the music

2019
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,448
I don't think it's

2020
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:20,032
Good and I think it's actually really dangerous

2021
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,104
Negative thing but right we'll content

2022
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:29,504
Looking at it as somebody whose external and recognizes nefarious motives on both sides bright

2023
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,064
It is interesting to see the

2024
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,832
The Clash

2025
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:33,856
Of agenda

2026
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:38,976
Which is

2027
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:48,192
Humiliated me like crazy in front of my audience.

2028
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:50,496
Confident at the end of this and I

2029
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,776
Probably extended

2030
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Too long

2031
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:57,152
Because I thought I could win in the end Drive traffic

2032
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,456
Maybe I'll

2033
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,528
Yeah so now Mike leaves and Alex

2034
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,672
I guess now is aware of other things that he should have brought up they took for an hour

2035
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
He lied in front of everyone

2036
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,864
You disgusting little rat

2037
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
What

2038
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,936
Not challenged him to come back on the show tomorrow

2039
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,472
Oh my God

2040
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,752
Because I meant to go

2041
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,544
Get to this I forgot about a while ago

2042
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,080
Yeah okay so

2043
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
Alex now has other post

2044
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:31,200
Since it is I should have brought this up you had a f****** hour

2045
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,784
I forgot I forgot to get to it I forgot to get to it

2046
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:39,904
Twice if you start to the splc I printed out a stack of

2047
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,672
30

2048
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,208
Single tweet per page

2049
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,768
And I just forgot to get to all the

2050
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:51,168
I frequently brought up how he should be killing Bill Gates if he's a real but I forgot to have my

2051
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:54,240
Evidence that he's a dirty little rat

2052
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:59,616
I don't I don't know exactly what Alex is even bringing up in that context

2053
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
Nor do I particularly care

2054
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:05,504
No I don't necessarily think that Alex is wrong that he wasn't

2055
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,808
Babe totally good faith actor

2056
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:13,696
His interview Mike was being a little bit disingenuous

2057
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
Why Alex is being

2058
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,768
Disingenuous

2059
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:20,608
Well I mean that you can't trust Azela tazel it has every just

2060
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,936
Navigation for lying in the service of

2061
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,032
Well there's one thing you can do with his out

2062
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Boxing match

2063
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,176
A 4727

2064
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:36,736
Do you think he's so freaking time all day long

2065
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,272
What do I get the money chair

2066
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,576
I am so sick of all these wannabe tough guys

2067
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,000
Look I don't

2068
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,792
Care one way or the other

2069
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,072
But

2070
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:51,840
Alex

2071
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,632
That dude will murder

2072
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:56,192
Will absolutely

2073
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,264
F****** murder you would take

2074
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:05,664
Is a little bit of ducking and dodging

2075
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,944
Hands up

2076
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
Hard to fight

2077
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,552
For a long time and in my longtime I mean 30

2078
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:16,928
If you're 20 years old you're boxing a very much out of shape Alex Jones

2079
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:23,328
Like 47 year-old dude sleep apnea

2080
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,632
Apologies

2081
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,936
Okay you don't want

2082
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,800
Connect on the first shot that if you dodge

2083
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,592
The first couple swings he takes

2084
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,616
He's done

2085
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,992
This isn't this isn't a four-minute 40 situation where you can still go 10 Rounds

2086
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
This is a dude

2087
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,320
Who will absolutely destroy you

2088
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,392
It would be it would be satisfying to watch

2089
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,792
Alex talks to Pete Santilli

2090
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:58,144
Got arrested after the Monday or know the amount or standoff

2091
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,680
Cuz he's apparently

2092
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:03,008
Now an expert on FBI infiltration

2093
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,056
On stuff until Alex needs to sort of

2094
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,616
Feel better about himself after getting

2095
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,640
Clowned by this

2096
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,664
Boogaloo dude

2097
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,224
And afterwards Alex realizes I

2098
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,248
Now right

2099
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:14,784
I know I don't want to box

2100
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,368
The first hour

2101
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,888
I just see of fertile

2102
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,264
And you know what fire by wants Revolution do whatever going to do

2103
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,544
Call joke about my

2104
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,312
McDonald's box

2105
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,896
What's his name

2106
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,920
Don't show

2107
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,992
What's it called

2108
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,296
Logan Paul and the other Paul guy

2109
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,624
Logan Collins never get the other guy's name

2110
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:52,928
The joke

2111
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
Okay

2112
01:42:53,952 --> 01:43:00,096
I don't really want to fight you you. You're definitely be made that'll be really embarrassing

2113
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,912
I probably would have at least a black eye

2114
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,496
Knock out all of the teeth I've been grinding

2115
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,520
I could use some new

2116
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:13,920
Cooler heads prevail

2117
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:19,040
I do think that I see the boogaloos as a way for the FBI in the

2118
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:21,600
The man to set us up now granted

2119
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:25,440
I've been spending weeks on my show using them as they Fall Guy

2120
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,488
Part of the storming of the capitol

2121
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,768
Just kind of the same thing

2122
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:32,096
I literally tried to get one to commit to a

2123
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:38,496
Cargoloc lemonade himself

2124
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,104
I'd happily and repeatedly that he works for the globalist secretly

2125
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,640
I failed

2126
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
I guess we'll be fried

2127
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,224
Friends now

2128
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,504
So embarrassing

2129
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
What did

2130
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
Ineffective

2131
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:54,880
Bad

2132
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:58,720
But there's nothing good that can come of this I don't even know what Alex expected

2133
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,792
In terms of like a positive outcome / list

2134
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:02,560
I do think

2135
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,840
It's really

2136
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
Really funny

2137
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,912
But Alex is doing this like

2138
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:11,264
I guess, has got a prevailing we got to be friends with these people that I have already said

2139
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,824
Are awful

2140
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,968
Wow the intro music that's playing Isidore's don't play with me cuz you're playing with fire and everyone

2141
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,248
I hate everyone

2142
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,528
That was an intern

2143
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:26,112
There's an intern who knows what's up

2144
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:29,696
He medically that is really funny

2145
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:35,840
Like I said this is sort of going to be a two-parter into Monday right now one of the reasons is

2146
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,888
Because I do know that at least

2147
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
Someone

2148
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
From the Boogaloo

2149
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,240
Folk is was on the show

2150
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:48,128
Thursday I did not have enough time before we needed to record in order to get that already

2151
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,432
For Friday's episode was that will be on Monday

2152
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:55,552
Will will be back on Monday for part two of this

2153
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,088
I haven't come up with a good pun

2154
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,112
Like

2155
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:00,672
The Caravan ready projects

2156
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,208
Trust Me by Monday

2157
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,488
I will have a great Bond

2158
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,816
Was there a

2159
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
Break-ins

2160
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
3

2161
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:11,168
Let's find out what's a good question

2162
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
I don't know

2163
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,520
Breakin 3

2164
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,336
Rubber Boogaloo

2165
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:23,712
I do not break a Breaking Bad season 3

2166
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:29,088
Hyundai brake

2167
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
We're having a great time

2168
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,840
There was no date

2169
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,680
Yeah they're going to get this game one of these days

2170
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:48,032
I think I think that there's some fun to be had by listening to this

2171
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,824
In terms of seeing somebody

2172
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,872
Mirror lot of Alex's s*** back

2173
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,408
To him in a way that Alex

2174
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,224
Can't really deal with can't really respond to

2175
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
Itsfunneh

2176
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:03,392
You hear him say hey you're probably controlled opposition implies like

2177
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:06,976
He thought that at the beginning of the interview

2178
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,256
Is weird

2179
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,560
Why even go if you think you could

2180
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:14,656
I don't know I mean why not make that the thing you bring up

2181
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:16,192
First I think

2182
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,984
Because if he brought that up

2183
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,776
First he wouldn't get the chance

2184
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,800
To defend

2185
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,336
Yeah the broccoli rabe

2186
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,640
It would immediately become like

2187
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:31,040
I'm not controlled opposition coloring

2188
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:33,856
The beginning of the interview

2189
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,392
The Poise that he's

2190
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
He's showing or the kind of lack of concern with

2191
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,488
The way out

2192
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,792
Is portraying him they come from a place of like

2193
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,840
I don't even believe you're real

2194
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:47,424
Yeah I mean I could also definitely come from a place where I mean obvious

2195
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Paisley he had a

2196
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,264
Quotes from Alex it could come from a place of

2197
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,592
The preparation if you if you believe that you're going on a show that's

2198
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
Controlled opposition

2199
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,408
Yeah I imagine you'd be like

2200
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Okay

2201
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,736
Then I have to find a way to defeat

2202
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:03,040
That otherwise there's no point in going

2203
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,576
Or or failing

2204
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,112
Defeating that

2205
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,928
Assistant place in a way that I can

2206
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,208
Achieve my goals

2207
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,512
Well not falling into the traps

2208
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,536
That will be set

2209
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,304
For me like

2210
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,096
Hey do you work for the splc

2211
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
Absolutely yeah

2212
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:21,472
And I think that he did that and I actually think that's why this is dangerous

2213
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,752
Because I think

2214
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:28,128
B Mike successfully navigated the terrain of Alex Jones is shity interview Style

2215
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,664
And I was given

2216
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
A place where

2217
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,272
He could appear to be the person who

2218
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
Lives Alex

2219
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,576
Jones's ideals

2220
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,672
And I would not be surprised if I was not an effective recruiting

2221
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,976
Mitul ya to anybody listen Galaxy

2222
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,792
Alex should recognize

2223
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,864
Intentional or not that is the effect

2224
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,400
That disorder

2225
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
It's okay

2226
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,752
The boogaloos should pay Alex

2227
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:56,800
Well and then there's just that

2228
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
Known

2229
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:01,408
Psychological exploit and Humanity

2230
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,944
He sounds so confident

2231
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,224
He sounds

2232
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,784
Like a true belief

2233
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,088
Fever and he's laying out

2234
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,624
Stuff in a way where you're like

2235
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,720
I guess revolution has to happen

2236
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,000
Somewhere that Alex

2237
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,072
Can't receive the exact can't disagree with it

2238
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,608
The best thing is like what later

2239
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,144
Later

2240
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,680
That's a dumb argument

2241
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,752
Do you have it

2242
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,080
Opposition to Orange exposition

The Alex Jones but I grew up listening to you know

2246
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,832
Creating that differentiation

2247
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136
Between the Alex Jones I grew up listening to and

2248
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,464
This person I'm talking to who is Alex Jones in the present

2249

The Clown

23 and under generation and not

2255
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,264
