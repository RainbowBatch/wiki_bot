Plexaderm

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,664
A little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
Paint with watercolors are acrylics

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,904
Probably when I was in our classes

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
In high school

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Got those electives

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,584
Never had any artist

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
Stickability draw 4

11
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,728
I can't I have no coordination

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
I don't know if I could draw Circle for you and right now I could barely do that cool ass fit

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,784
Andrew on their folders

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
I've always looked very self-conscious about my inability

15
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,208
To even do that kind of rudimentary things I never really tried

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Because my brother was always really good at cartoon

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah I felt like he had the ark

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Cystic ability

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Had glasses

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,664
Jump into his yeah absolutely

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
That worked out pretty well

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,600
Technically probably but never

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
NeverWet by choice

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,352
Started the prison for you I guess I don't know anything about

25
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Effects

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Creative

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,008
But I do know a lot of

28
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
And I don't know about actually

29
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
To the podcast

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Can't wait let's do it actually first before we do

31
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
People who are supporting

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
You're now a policy

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
I'm a policy wonk

Brigitte

38
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
That might not be

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,248
Brigitte Nielsen

40
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm pretty sure it's not

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
Either way we appreciate it very much and apologize

42
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
For our ambivalent

43
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Thank you so much you are now policy walk

46
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Much less

47
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
The weather like outside

48
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,920
Somebody

49
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,208
Heroin

50
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
So good

51
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Is freakishly large

52
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Absolute

53
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
So Jordan

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,736
Still I was so unsatisfied by the last

55
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,808
2013

56
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,928
Like sodas

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
So I stuck around

58
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
Cuz I felt like every time out

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Harlow

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
Like dead pastors

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
Nothing growing in them

62
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Generally that means

63
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,848
I usually feel like he recognizes I'm not bringing it

64
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
He'll give you something

65
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
I'll tell you to give me something

66
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
I'm not sure what it was but

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Through eight

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
2013

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
But before we get into that at like 2

70
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
Just give everybody a run

71
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,839
In the present day of Alex Jones

72
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
Rainbow snatch

73
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Absolutely

74
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
Millie Weaver is going out trolling people

75
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
Real exciting

76
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
To cover the price

77
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
So much laugh

78
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Because it's like

79
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
What are you doing

80
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
What is the go

81
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,927
Kaitlin Bennett are both going out to like Pride events

82
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
The trick people into signing

83
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Capitation

84
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
Where are they like

85
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,007
Prove nothing it's just distractionary

86
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
It's lame and desperate

87
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Tension

88
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
I'm not interested

89
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
Makes me feel like I don't want to be involved you guys do what you doing have fun absolutely don't even care

90
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,207
Me to comment on what you're doing it scares me because the comedy is so bad

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,767
The intent

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
True

93
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
But it's not even hard to say

94
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Bad that I would slip from

95
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
To just outright being mean to it

96
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Because I take it is almost expensive towards powder

97
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
Maybe you could be me

98
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Neither a little bit

99
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
She deserves a little higher but also aware of Alex lose

100
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:56,351
That's a lawsuit

101
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
No it is not but it's probably about right

102
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
Admire it when people Sue Alex and they're not punitive

103
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
Appreciate a little bit

104
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Just trying to abusively

105
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,903
Katana Bonnie from

106
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
To charity it's not even about

107
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
Getting this money from Allen

108
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
Sabor principal

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
The thing

110
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
It's okay yeah that's great

111
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
His attorney your

112
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Best friend

113
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
Please come out and declared Victory even though they had to pay for

114
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
Workbar artist

115
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,735
Also just before we started recording update

116
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Rodger stone is back

117
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
On the show

118
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,743
Maybe there's some things that are covered

119
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
We'll talk more about that

120
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
Rodger Stone has made contact with Raptors

121
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,567
Can you talk a little bit more about that

122
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,919
A little weak wrap up on Friday but I have

123
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
But I just couldn't muster it and I wanted to

124
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Stick around

125
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Valic

126
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Said me

127
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,135
Something really sucked up

128
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Adult

129
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
So we didn't hear we're going to start on the 6th

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Alex

131
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Delivers

132
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
Almost immediately

133
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Ski is

134
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Weird

135
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
A very strange mood

136
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
And he has found some science news that

137
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
He does not understand

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
Major scientific

139
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
Other matter

140
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:59,999
Ordered format

141
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,287
96% of DNA

142
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,415
Amanda

143
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
Wellington

144
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,287
God

145
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
We are

146
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Spirit

147
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
Cichlids

148
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,479
Oh s*** s***

149
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
We're in trouble

150
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
Trouble the world

151
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Chucky

152
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Cuz he read the Bible

153
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Yeah

154
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
This

155
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
Is a bat house

156
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,495
Early

157
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
Maybe after the first break

158
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
You still even back in 2013

159
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
Have that's the first couple minutes

160
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
About the eight-minute mark cuz that's what everyone

161
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
It's from like 02

162
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,695
To about like

163
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
5 minutes

164
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
For 5 minutes

165
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
That's just that no man's land that usually station IDs

166
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Gamestop.com

167
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Come back at 8

168
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Yeah it's somewhere around there I believe

169
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
It's pretty

170
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
He's getting into the

171
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
Seattle simulation news

172
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Oh boy

173
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
Hey this isn't news

174
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
But all the idea that Alex has figured out that some people believe the world is

175
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Simulation

176
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
And that he's turned it into proof

177
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Of his version of God 2013

178
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,863
Before

179
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
He's bringing it up now cuz

180
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
Stop

181
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
Article that came out in

182
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
On October 11th

183
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
12

184
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Stop

185
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Recent research

186
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
The cosmic ray

187
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
The researchers studying the particles found that they had a limit

188
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
So how much energy

189
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
These particles

190
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
And that limit appear to be arbitrary

191
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Is possibly representing evidence

192
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
The built-in limit

193
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
In the physical universe that are part of the

194
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
The parameters

195
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Overstimulation Within

196
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
However the article isn't written by

197
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
So it also points out quote

198
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
It could be those that were incorrectly interpreting evidence of certain fundamental laws that we are as yet unfamiliar with

199
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,431
It could even be that this isn't evidence at all for a simulator as a real lattice might work in a different way

200
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
As to how we would envision

201
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,063
So it's really

202
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
It's really fun to imagine that we live in

203
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Computer simulation

204
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
Matrix is real but more measured analysis

205
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
Test include the possibility that we just don't know anything

206
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
Restraint

207
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
To take something back

208
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
B suggest

209
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Sing some new findings

210
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Interpretation

211
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Bike supported B

212
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
Want to hear Alex talk about this article that's all I really hear

213
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Do you want

214
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
To believe the world

215
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Simulation

216
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Three Texas article

217
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,231
Ignoring the part about how it's totally possible

218
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
Rule the cosmic particles that we don't

219
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Understand

220
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Paul Joseph Watson in to talk about it he comes

221
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
The very boring.

222
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Call Michelle

223
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
But yeah

224
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
It's B

225
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
It's a real religiosity

226
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
The thing that

227
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
The religious

228
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Understand more and more about

229
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
Even they're going to eventually

230
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
About

231
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
The speed of light squared

232
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
I don't know

233
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Why because

234
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
That's what it is

235
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Can the universe exist

236
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Without these

237
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Is there universe

238
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
Are we in a long string of possible universes

239
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,623
Guess what

240
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,463
Jesus bones not enjoy

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
The occasional thinking about this stuff

242
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,751
I'm a little bit more about this

243
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Talk about the simulation

244
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Siri but here's

245
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,575
Research firms

246
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Computer

247
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,423
6%

248
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,287
Credible

249
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
All sorts of other

250
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
Crystalline solid

251
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,975
Doesn't

252
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,631
The true spirituality

253
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,111
Which is the first

254
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
So do you understand

255
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
This is starting to develop a little bit in 2013

256
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
Heard that will couple time

257
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
Did this is a primarily Evangelical Quest that he's on

258
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
Almost

259
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
A way of Trojan horsing

260
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
His version of God on piano

261
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Which is

262
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
F***** up

263
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
Creepiest it's really weird to think about

264
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Maybe there is something

265
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
But that's his primary driver

266
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Yeah

267
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
Just trying to get through whatever

268
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
Yeah that's the that's the idea he feels like his life's work is

269
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Follow through

270
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Computers

271
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Call Dax

272
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,367
Yeah maybe I mean I would say obviously

273
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
I believe

274
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
One example of him losing the thread

275
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Basically what he said is

276
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Atheist

277
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Watched all those bad preachers in real life

278
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
There's probably no God

279
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:13,311
They just don't know that our DNA is a crystal

280
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
Would never happen

281
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Anymore

282
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
I'm not entirely sure what you mean

283
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Empire crystalline

284
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
At work event

285
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
That there's other life forms

286
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
Alien DNA

287
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
Dangerously close to carry cats

288
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Citibusiness

289
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
I think what he's referencing

290
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
Is the

291
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
I can't remember

292
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,943
Exactly what it is but it's kind of

293
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
Certain genetic material.

294
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Get destroyed in viruses

295
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Maybe it was attached

296
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:02,719
Meteorite

297
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Good DNA cover

298
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
Asteroid

299
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,887
But of course if we have alien DNA

300
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Things were here before us

301
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,199
Text leptitox a little bit more about that and I really think

302
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Strong indication

303
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
All he's really interested in this

304
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Simulation

305
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Theory narrative

306
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Is using it

307
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
A jump-off point

308
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Right version of Christian

309
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
Science is increasingly

310
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Created universe

311
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
Address for computer

312
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:03,391
Isn't even

313
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
I stopped listening to God

314
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,863
Creators

315
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,615
Which is

316
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Creation

317
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
Glad we got pjw three in there

318
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Wave at you

319
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Well precise

320
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
You bet Alex

321
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,351
No matter what you say is kind of dismissive

322
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Bubbles fundamental

323
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
Pause this podcast

324
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
So I can understand what's going on here

325
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,871
Yeah it feels like a college dorm

326
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
Like on some real

327
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Spiritual biz

328
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
At the beginning of this

329
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Episode

330
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,807
That's one possibility

331
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:42,207
Another possibility is just like he's out of his week in terms of understanding stories

332
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
We're kind of in his wheelhouse

333
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
To strip all contacts from

334
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
God

335
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,751
What's the problem

336
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,847
He's not going to alienate any of his audience by doing that either but I go home

337
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
Oh my God

338
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
It doesn't take the whole show

339
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,599
Beginning although he does Touchback

340
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
Michelle keeps plate-spinning

341
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
God's grace

342
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Butts

343
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Before he moves on to his neck

344
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Better Business

345
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,327
He's got to tell you about how

346
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Successful

347
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Operation

348
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
Get

349
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
13 + 100

350
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
That is

351
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Crazy

352
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Almost

353
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,071
Impossible to believe that number is possibly

354
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
Almost no sense that if

355
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Gcn

356
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
At least indicate 2:30

357
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
300

358
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
Why would Alex only be on once

359
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Sure seems weird

360
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,151
Only on like 200 radio station

361
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,063
So why would those 11:00 other stations not are the most

362
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
Popular show on the network if

363
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Them nothing

364
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,744
The oldest Snapchat snapshot you can find on the Wayback machine at the

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Gcn

366
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
Is from October 14th

367
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
2014

368
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
And the numbers they're claiming it's a

369
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Stanford is smaller than the one

370
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
They alleged to be working with

371
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
What's 641 radio

372
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
Which Alex is on 100

373
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
6 number

374
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
Funtrivia Veterinary

375
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Doctor has a radio show

376
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
It's only on 12

377
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,648
Peter Glidden that fake doctor that we talked about on the last episode has a show to

378
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:54,048
I also Webster Tarpley showworld

379
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
What what are they run on other station

380
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
Do I have 600

381
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,288
Hunter show

382
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Tiny amount of

383
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Small-market

384
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,224
They offer a lot of stuff for his I understand the primary business model is

385
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
Resyndication

386
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
You make a dress

387
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Resume wassom

388
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
Oh my God create podcast

389
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,744
It's not a free like it.

390
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
I think I still don't actually misspoke earlier also

391
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,216
Most popular show on

392
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Medications that work

393
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,592
I guess I just kind of always assumed you was the largest profile

394
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
That works

395
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
He's not the most widely syndicated show on G

396
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
No it's

397
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,160
Calling show 160

398
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
P5's

399
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Wow

400
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,560
To grow Salix

401
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,144
And all the snapshots that I found more popular

402
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,752
Dcmo go on to cross the mark of being on over 1000 stay

403
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
By August

404
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
28

405
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Team

406
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
But what's fascinating is that

407
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
The network

408
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Expanding

409
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
But it doesn't appear that Alex is doing the same

410
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,832
Constantly hovering around 100 to 120

411
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
Patience Mark even is gcn it added 400 New Station

412
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
It really appears that the growth of the network

413
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
Seeing is around other shows not Alex

414
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
There's a very

415
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Real possibility that he

416
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Reached his potential already

417
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
2013

418
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
And networks weren't even interested

419
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Generic is chauffeur

420
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
I think there's a decent possibility

421
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
Back razor

422
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Could explain

423
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,456
One is Alex's incredibly toxic bran

424
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,016
Yeah of course even back then

425
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,600
Even though he wasn't such a monster and everybody knew it you still might not want

426
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
Play show on your network

427
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Seaside

428
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
You might know somebody whose work with him and radio be like don't work with that guy just all kinds of possibilities

429
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
Yeah

430
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
The second possibility is that

431
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Like advertising

432
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Bike cost

433
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Katana moron

434
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
So even though a terrorist

435
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,104
For free the syndication

436
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,504
Finding sponsors that would be willing to buy ad time during his show on your network

437
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,272
Might be

438
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Prohibitive

439
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
From a cost a

440
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Yeah you still have to have good sales

441
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Yeah it's just Alex

442
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Text taking the

443
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
The burden on

444
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,120
Good luck

445
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
Or whatever

446
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
There's there's a lot of possibilities

447
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
He's not the biggest

448
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
Wichita

449
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
I always really thought so

450
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,408
And I think you probably way back but

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,736
Early 2000s

452
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Baby

453
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
A little bit more

454
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Noblesse

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Let's baggage

456
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,976
But still libertarian

457
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
So much bigger Forge

458
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Gcn their cultural footprint

459
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Is ultimately

460
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
In some circles

461
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,776
But yeah products

462
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Is plugged into the YouTube culture of

463
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
The 2013

464
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,432
Yeah they're not as controversial you can have something

465
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
Pretty popular but if

466
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
If you don't make waves the people outside of

467
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
The audience

468
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,320
May never actually be

469
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,600
Become aware of

470
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,928
I'm willing to bet that possibility

471
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Talk live it's just way outside our radar

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,560
Also

473
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Misleading

474
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
Third or fourth largest

475
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,936
Best indicator of shows based on Numbers Station

476
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
But they're not

477
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
That's

478
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
For claiming that you're huge cup

479
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,640
Like Premiere networks thing at over 5000 radio.

480
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,456
And have way way higher.

481
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
They worked with people like Limbaugh Glenn Beck

482
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Seacrest Inn Coast

483
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Completely different ballgame

484
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Gcn

485
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,072
Putting youngevity fake doctors on a radio station in Barstow California

486
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:16,192
Also Salem Radio Network had a about 2,000 Affiliates at that time

487
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
Westwood one head over eight

488
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
8000 station

489
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
Even if you accept Alex's

490
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Is 13

491
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Number

492
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
Application game

493
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
If he ever got called up to

494
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Navigation to Valley

495
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,696
Pretty good about

496
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
The business

497
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Feeling pretty full of

498
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Themself

499
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
But he starts talking about

500
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424

501
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,240
Molon labe

502
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,872
Wrestling term putting someone over

503
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920

He you know you talkin about the magazine in the posters

00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:45,280
The image from the shirt become so popular

512
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
That's crazy

513
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:51,168
That's the legendary Patriots stuff

514
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Great shirt

515
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,240

Bumper sticker giveaways

524
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,800
Bumper stickers but you got to promise not to put them on other people's cars

525
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,432
Bumper sticker without getting a waiver

526

Stretch of the show

533
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
They can start to that simulation.

534
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
And then for a lot of

535
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Ashoka

536
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152

00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Interviews that lady

558
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,456
I will destroy all my enemies

559
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504

Yeah I don't I don't like that very false

563
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
It's a very performative

564
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
In his mind

565
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
He has to rationalize have

566
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,568
Just have fun for the sake of

00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
Socks

00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
But it's

569
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Because this isn't

570
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Evangelical

571
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Quest for him

572
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,136
Is really secretly about to accept his version of God

573
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
And that's why I

574
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
You take this call

575
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744

Yuck

581
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,208
Uno's

582
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Is probably almost one hundred percent

583
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,864
Especially when they're f****** Alex Jones

584
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,984
A hundred percent of a Time Alex is f***** up

585
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Alex takes

586
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
The 7th off

587
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
He just is gone

588
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,920
Just got

589
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Do some fishing

590
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Course

591
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Is Tolo

592
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,040
Comes back on

593
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Probably

594
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,392
I don't know usually just mentioned be with a friend

595
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
How old Rex Widow benefits play

596
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
You might

597
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,000
You're never too young.

598
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,144
But every time he's tried to go out with

599
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,728
He's canceled at this time he doesn't call Dan cell

600
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
Tell Paul what to do

601
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,360
And that means I turned it off after

602
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,408
Could call

603
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
That guy has no chops

604
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
And Alex do some

605
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
Is it blew my mind

606
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
This

607
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
I can't understand

608
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,960
Absolutely absolutely

609
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:22,944
Police officers

610
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,736
California

611
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
Veteran and police force

612
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,400
Deserve

613
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,592
Because it sounds exactly

614
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
But the system is now

615
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,968
Looking for

616
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,808
Power Trip

617
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:04,672
How much he loves

618
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:09,792
But he's going around

619
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
Reportedly

620
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Weird

621
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,296
So I

622
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
How you find this

623
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,624
Profoundly weird

624
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
What is going on

625
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Sue Jordan

626
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,232
Patterns of developed about Alex's personality

627
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,512
The time that we've been watching

628
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,840
Not only is personality but it's style as a broad

629
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,728
You can get a sense for the sort of stories that he prioritizes what sort of angles will take onset story

630
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
And what story

631
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,568
He's knows that he's better off just leaving alone staying away from

632
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:58,944
This story that he's talking about is the story in the news about Christopher Doran

633
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
Who's the guy who killed

634
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,552
Some police officers and there was a

635
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
That is

636
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
Where we in Alex's wheelhouse

637
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
As a story he would cover and one you would expect

638
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
He would make the biggest

639
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,256
Ballato

640
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:19,168
We're get to that I don't explain everything everything

641
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Allison Stokke

642
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,824
Who's playing for the globalist

643
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,152
They're about to pull off another huge false-flag to take away is gone

644
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,992
He's a interrupted his own broadcast multiple times

645
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Because there was school shooting

646
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
That more

647
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Systematically murdering police

648
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
What you would definitely think would be something you could work with

649
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
How does Alex respond

650
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,560
This episode of February 8th

651
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,912
That Point Police been searching for doerner for 5 days

652
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
And this is literally the first time I've heard him bring that story up

653
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
He was on vacation for one of those days but

654
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah it's crazy

655
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,944
Why why there is no reason for this not

656
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Beyond Alex's radar

657
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
The first killing was on February 3rd

658
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,344
And by the fourth that Manifesto have been posted online

659
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
But listening to Alex's

660
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,696
Future Tagalog about the world being a simulation

661
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,792
The talking all this weird s*** about God joking around with collars cuz he's so angry

662
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
What makes this even more insane

663
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
Is the what happened after the shooting

664
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
Exactly what Alex yells about all the

665
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
What time

666
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,800
The LA Police Department was desperate to resolve this

667
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
Considering you had extensive military training

668
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
Willingness to shoot civilians

669
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
In their desperation they made so

670
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
Mistakes

671
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,784
On February 7th the morning of February 7th

672
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Actor Alex

673
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Started

674
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
Shot at three people

675
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,488
Which is an underhand pitch if I've ever seen one

676
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,864
Alex could knock that out of the park so easily yelling about the police state and how they manufactured the shooting

677
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:59,264
In order to have an excuse to shoot at civilians people to know that their sheep or something

678
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,384
Cops station perfect perfect

679
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
It's a damn layup for Alex

680
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
You spent all his energy

681
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,368
Over these last looks

682
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,416
This like

683
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
It's not even an issue

684
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
He does bring it up

685
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
This is the one that he thinks is real

686
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Crazy but I think it's pretty easy to

687
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Acy

688
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
One like you pointed out Christopher Dorner is black

689
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
Alex's business model is about making

690
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Excuses for white Terror

691
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
So I don't feel like

692
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,080
Fields beneath

693
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
To get out of his way

694
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Get to

695
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
He doesn't

696
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Yeah yeah

697
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
The whole story

698
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,528
I mean I kind of do but I think there's more subtlety

699
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
It's not captured within that broad

700
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,624
Exclamation

701
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,024
Could fit that into a large

702
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,608
ShopRite

703
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
The people that Alex

704
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
Consist are not actually

705
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Shooters

706
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Fat in these situations whenever heavy

707
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Are always white right wing

708
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
His show

709
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,176
It's one of those groups

710
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Is what he needs

711
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,320
He's believing false Wags is based around the idea that people of those group

712
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
Don't commit crime

713
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,184
Ever is the globalist

714
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,536
Cut out or whatever to make it look like

715
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Demonized

716
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
When the perpetrators of a crime

717
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,288
Regardless of how closely their actions match up with his beliefs about what the globalist up to

718
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
And that should be very f******

719
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Suspicious

720
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
Yeah

721
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Daughter is not white

722
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,808
He expresses infusiasm about Hillary winning in 2016

723
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
He supports reasonable gun-control measure

724
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
Stein for her efforts at getting an assault weapon

725
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,280
And he is definitely not a fan of Infowars

726
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,584
As he explicitly goes out of his way to say Isa

727
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,120
Supports Piers Morgan's Point

728
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Using Alex's

729
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Twisted logic

730
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,104
If you were to say that this shooting in Manhunt worst days

731
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,688
Globalist

732
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Demonize themselves

733
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,576
And if Alex is completely falls apart

734
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
Calling the shooting real

735
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Less to do with racism towards

736
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,792
Daughter it more about preserving The Narrative that he'll need in order to minimize and

737
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
Excuse white terrorism

738
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Later

739
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
This is a protect

740
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Yeah yeah

741
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
It's very in

742
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
Interesting the way Alex's mindworks

743
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,032
These RV false Flags but I think

744
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
If you watch how

745
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Keep you close with

746
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
You get a sense that

747
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
It's super important

748
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
As a defense

749
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,320
Yeah that is it

750
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
I think it's clear in this

751
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Next clip

752
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
That's kind of the vibe

753
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
Shooting

754
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Thinking

755
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
F****** stupid

756
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Here's what I got for you I'm going to level it up

757
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,304
Alright I'm in level it up

758
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,448
Movie where you're going to do this

759
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
It's still there didn't make the pictures

760
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:47,104
Put bad because it's going to

761
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,504
Bright

762
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,344
It could be that Obama

763
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
Bye

764
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Using one of his own supporters at

765
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
The Patsy

766
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
In order to make it

767
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
Is a right-wing person

768
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
It wasn't

769
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
What's that

770
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Great sit right

771
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,752
Whatever

772
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
It really is Alex

773
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Taking

774
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
This is denialism

775
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,552
Deeply f*****-up

776
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,648
Very disrespectful to people who are affected by this tragedy

777
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,232
I think this really happened but also I disagree with all of

778
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
Reality so I don't know

779
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
I do think there is a race

780
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
I think that that's more about that

781
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
Preserving

782
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,032
The false flag narrative

783
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
Anything else

784
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,663
Might be a little bit

785
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,879
For the eyes are just

786
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:06,463
Smiling

787
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
So I think I am

788
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
The pictures

789
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
He's talking about

790
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
I don't think

791
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Yeah

792
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,295
Know that he was a guy who went and shot a bunch of

793
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,623
People you wouldn't think all my God look at this creepy person

794
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Alex's project

795
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Something that you feel

796
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:43,583
Probably not good that boiled down to one word

797
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
That word is up

798
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:49,471
That is what he was doing right the f*** there

799
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
F***** up

800
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Probably

801
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
But

802
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,871
Someone whose opinion matters about anything

803
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
This next clip

804
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Blue my mind

805
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
Whatever he's talking about here doesn't matter

806
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Not matter cuz that works

807
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
Accidentally said something

808
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
That I really think you should spend an entire show.

809
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
I'm about to cuz I really need to hear more about this

810
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
System

811
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
What

812
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,991
I think I think that Alex

813
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,367
What does a obtuse

814
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:46,047
Biomechanical I know they're not mechanical

815
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,655
Please

816
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,983
More about that h

817
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,567
The whole episode about bugs

818
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,383
This is what I'm going to track

819
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Any other time

820
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,295
From now on any times bug some up form

821
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,183
We're going to have to keep picnic this is the new Alex killed his dog

822
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,743
That's wild

823
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
Course

824
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
It's a day on Alex

825
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,607
The show so there's a new gun

826
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
About

827
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Some sort of bail

828
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Going through

829
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
Sou gets into that to your

830
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
And

831
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
Exactly what it sounds

832
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,663
The name of the voice

833
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:15,647
California

834
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
Voice with MS.

835
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Remember it being

836
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:24,351
October 23rd

837
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
California

838
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,543
We said quote I don't believe that this bill automatic rifles

839
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
Criminal activity

840
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Enough to Warrant this

841
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,759
Get your guns and the Second Amendment

842
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:46,879
Where were the Democratic governor vetoed the legislation that could have easily been made law

843
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,911
Ideas that Alex has about this thing that never actually ended up becoming a law

844
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
I think that last clip is

845
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
Perfect as a reference

846
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239
Temptation of how Alex

847
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
To set him up

848
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
To be in a position

849
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
To have his cake and eat it too

850
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,711
Free Azrael series framing this gun bill in terms of disarming

851
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Innocence

852
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
The government wants you to be the

853
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
His real crime

854
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
Now let's imagine a scenario where Alex said that

855
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,815
If that were the case Alex gets applied the angles

856
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,631
Does fake and exist to terrorize the public

857
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
You take away the guns

858
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,519
Yep it works no matter what the input is the output

859
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
It the point behind it is exactly the same

860
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
No matter what

861
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
It's that it's ridiculous

862
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,807
It also seems beneficial in 2013 that all of his position

863
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
So long as Obama is in

864
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
Empower almost

865
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
From any kind of

866
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
Like everything is almost seems to work out because it doesn't really matter which way he's still able to play

867
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,167
Ellen wants 2016 comes around

868
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
Now he's

869
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
Defending all kinds

870
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
So what's your

871
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
Defense

872
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,639
The first couple months

873
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:17,247
This game doesn't work never your

874
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,831
I get really really difficult to play the

875
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
Conspiracy

876
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Apiarist

877
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
Truth-teller

878
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,183
When your party is in

879
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,583
In control of just about everything and there's no

880
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,423
There's nothing stopping drops

881
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Declassifying whatever you want

882
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
There's nothing stopping him from

883
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Technology

884
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
He knows about this there's nothing

885
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,783
The counter counter-coup narrative

886
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Asterix

887
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Because even when you're in power urine opposition

888
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
That's the way to preserve the business

889
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,695
This model

890
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
You get out of

891
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
You get out of step with reality

892
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Realized

893
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
From this cliff

894
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
Just how

895
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,823
You know like you know you can almost take away his

896
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
Because there's no bad

897
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
I kind of

898
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
As long as you cooperate as

899
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
Yeah as long as he was like

900
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,831
Wendy was coming up before Trump

901
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
He was making good choices in

902
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Successful

903
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Where is reality

904
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Clinton was in office

905
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Before Trump

906
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,055
Hillary or Bill

907
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,943
Culture got much uglier because of people's feelings

908
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,039
Alex

909
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
And even with bush

910
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
Like it it

911
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:58,879
It's not

912
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
It's not even a

913
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Necessarily

914
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,743
To be there

915
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,863
That's all that really matters as long as the president

916
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
Yeah this works

917
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Yeah

918
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
No matter how bad he is it still work

919
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
As long as he's full of

920
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,247
Arvest

921
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,551
You know on our last episode

922
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
As long as his hatred

923
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Conspiracy

924
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
And anger

925
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Focus

926
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Outrage

927
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Just directed at the Powerstroke

928
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,791
Really

929
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
All that much

930
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
That difficult

931
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
It's America

932
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Involved

933
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,287
And the problem

934
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,311
To the present

935
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
With creating Boogeyman

936
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
And of the deep state

937
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
It doesn't

938
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
The way that Alex

939
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Describing it

940
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
So

941
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,415
Nebulous

942
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Anthony

943
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
It doesn't work

944
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
The same way as

945
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Like bush

946
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,863
Target

947
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,143
Your outrage

948
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
Victimized

949
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Recruit

950
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Texas pain comes

951
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
The fact that one time

952
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
I'm his mom.

953
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,735
I slipped off from a

954
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,527
Did you know that

955
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
How close was that

956
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
I'm not sure

957
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:42,559
This story may or may not be true but here's Alex telling a story about a helicopter flying by his mom's house

958
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,543
Dollars

959
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
My dad is heaven

960
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
12 years ago

961
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:55,775
Wow

962
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,615
So

963
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
For him thinking that is

964
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
The real shooting

965
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
I mean of course it is

966
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
A real shooting his conclusion is

967
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
So bizarre

968
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,391
These people came over and flipped my mom off at of a helicopter

969
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
Right

970
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Find

971
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,375
And also I don't want to get to

972
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Into doerner

973
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
Today except for

974
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
To experience the weirdness

975
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
Miss of Alex

976
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Two things

977
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,311
Something is real

978
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,127
Because the shooting goes on until the 12th

979
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,247
I'm so tell the 12th so this is probably

980
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
I do think so and I'm interested

981
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
To see how Alex

982
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,135
Response

983
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
The actual story

984
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Maybe he

985
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Is an article

986
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,535
Other than

987
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,839
Bullet points about his Manifesto

988
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
He likes Piers Morgan

989
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,447
The real shooting

990
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
Yeah and it goes on for the 12

991
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
So I am

992
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Hoping for

993
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Serious Whiplash on a

994
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
The 9th

995
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Fake shooting

996
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,711
The real shooting again

997
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,063
Anything Could Happen

998
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
Him to be consistent

999
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,463
Scorpi gets off the the shooting

1000
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
Stop

1001
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Buju.

1002
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,815
Which is weird

1003
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
Because it was

1004
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,447
I remember this very clearly. Of time

1005
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,983
The media was all over this

1006
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Because it was a very

1007
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:35,359
Scary story

1008
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
Military training

1009
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,943
Who had an axe

1010
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
The Grind

1011
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,503
With the police

1012
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,087
Felt

1013
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
Department

1014
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Terminated

1015
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,671
And we're willing

1016
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
To take this route

1017
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
Clearing their name

1018
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
Write like

1019
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Scary

1020
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
Circumstance

1021
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,703
Yeah yeah yeah because of the movie already talked about

1022
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
The police figuring out how to

1023
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Respond

1024
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Buckets

1025
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
All the f******

1026
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
Set in

1027
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
Different country it was set

1028
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Down your block

1029
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
Yeah and he was coming after you

1030
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Your brain

1031
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,183
Alex the treated is so like

1032
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
Kind of

1033
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
It's weird

1034
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,791
Talkin about it buddy

1035
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
You care that much

1036
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,167
You don't care a little bit on this episode about that there was news of

1037
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,191
Asteroid that was

1038
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
Comes fairly close to Earth

1039
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
But everybody is like

1040
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,871
World

1041
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,527
All right out I like that

1042
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Interesting

1043
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,743
But these people are liars your might not be okay

1044
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,815
27,000 miles of Earth but also

1045
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,119
Might be coming for your house

1046
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Yeah

1047
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Stuff going on in

1048
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,591
What happened on this episode that are far more

1049
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
And here is the first one

1050
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,175
I think Alex

1051
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Slips up a little bit at the

1052
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
The beginning of this clip

1053
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
And then overcompensate

1054
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
A bit towards the at

1055
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
Watching all this

1056
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,551
Freedomworks

1057
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,023
Wyoming

1058
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,095
Ghostbusters

1059
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
George W bush

1060
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:40,447
Whoa

1061
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
Imma stop right there

1062
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
Facts

1063
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,959
I'd strongly disagree

1064
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,335
If this is the result if you take the day off to go shoot a bunch of guns this is not good therapy

1065
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,895
Might be very ineffective therapy

1066
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,271
I think he started positive things about freedomworks

1067
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Well I got it

1068
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Why do something

1069
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Started

1070
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:06,463
Grabbing it whatever he could come up with

1071
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
Blossom

1072
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
Submariner

1073
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Effeminate and also

1074
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Pretty much just

1075
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:21,055
Scrambling because he get something positive about a group you should be 100%

1076
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
I really am scared of his

1077
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Genuinely

1078
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Because that he

1079
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,503
Really thought that was funny and I don't

1080
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,927
Yeah

1081
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,487
Very unpleasant

1082
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
I think that it's

1083
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Towing

1084
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Isn't against

1085
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Freedomworks

1086
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,191
He knows about them

1087
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
Because

1088
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
I mean

1089
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,799
The fact that he's aware and not again

1090
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,079
Memes

1091
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Stomper

1092
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,895
I doesn't mean that he's taking money

1093
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,711
It's a it's a mismatch

1094
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
Where

1095
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,759
He should be

1096
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,295
From his own there

1097
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,367
Yeah it's another piece of him

1098
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,695
You should know that their Koch related yeah

1099
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
If you knows about Glenn Beck's involvement with

1100
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
I don't know

1101
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,655
Oh and also George Bush didn't call Karl Rove turd blossom

1102
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
Because you like to talk about

1103
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,751
It was reference to a flower that grows out of

1104
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,591
Karl Rove made the most

1105
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
Very stupid

1106
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,223
But I was looking up very

1107
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
And I had forgotten how insane his

1108
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,599
Did you know that

1109
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Call Maureen Dowd

1110
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
The cobra

1111
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
The time now

1112
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
Silvio Berlusconi

1113
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,703
Look up shoes I can play

1114
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,311
My favorite though is that used call Vladimir Putin ostrich lay eggs

1115
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063
What's up today or how much of that is PR can I ask

1116
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,903
You're buying Hook Line

1117
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
Idiot

1118
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
All that lot of acceptance

1119
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,583
Match-up yeah

1120
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
Good humor

1121
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
I just

1122
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:33,151
Like maybe halfway through you know like you'll see your wrestling or boxing match where someone's cardio doesn't hold up

1123
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,527
Yeah

1124
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
I think Alex is

1125
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
I just think that he's

1126
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
He needs to regroup

1127
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,079
Good music

1128
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,871
I had job

1129
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,503
Don't know much about history

1130
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
Yeah

1131
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,279
And

1132
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,967
That sucks

1133
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
What's printings abalone

1134
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
I don't know I think it's

1135
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
Another thing

1136
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
He's obliquely referencing is

1137
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
Hillary Clinton ad

1138
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Recent

1139
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:27,071
Leopold fairly well ability ratings

1140
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,119
Most of the bologna

1141
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,191
A weird state

1142
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,239
He's a real f****** weird place

1143
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,567
Crazy

1144
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,847
Here and then getting it

1145
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
I went running today

1146
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
Stopped

1147
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Got to take it again I love running

1148
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:50,879
It's the age-old sign when you say anyways the point is and then get back on

1149
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,207
Like you're almost Dismount the weird tangent but then

1150
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
It's a straight party time

1151
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
And so he

1152
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
Begin service

1153
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
Recovering

1154
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
The asteroid news

1155
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
Is a strain

1156
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
CenturyLink

1157
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Something happens

1158
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
Before

1159
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
But not very often

1160
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
The asteroid

1161
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,367
Propulsion

01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,159
Ettore

1163
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,591
We see who's calling from an unknown number

1164
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,127
What

1165
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
What

1166
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,063
You can't do that

1167
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439

Alex is so desperate to get on any other sophono allegedly geraldo's Booker

1171
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623

I do I adjust

1175
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:50,175
To the idea that anyone have a business meeting on Earth

1176
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
What's going on

1177
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
Yeah

1178
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,135
Pro-ana prostaff

1179
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:05,279
After the Mueller report

1180
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,839
You taking calls

1181
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,631
Disappointment of Segway

1182
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
How to display

1183
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
I think really what's going on

1184
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
Cover all this stuff

1185
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
He doesn't

1186
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,103
He's decided that the doerner shooting is

1187
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Real

1188
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Good enough

1189
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,223
Rabbit

1190
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
Positive ratings

1191
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
Is asteroids stuff

1192
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
I don't want to talk about it

1193
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,671
I'm going to I'm going to accidentally

1194
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,791
Globe

1195
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
This is where I got the sense

1196
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
But you like he doesn't really even want to be

1197
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
We doing his show and that's why you keep

1198
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,239
F****** Rissa

1199
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Thing on stuff

1200
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:53,919
It was all just take phone calls for a couple seconds

1201
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
I don't want to

1202
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,599
I don't do this

1203
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,975
I was talking about that asteroid story I don't have anybody

1204
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:17,215
You look take some calls

1205
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,455
Starts telling a story

1206
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
And this is one of these this is one of these

1207
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,551
This is where I don't believe this

1208
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
Great-grandfather was a

1209
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
I also don't care about this

1210
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
I do think

1211
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
This is an indication this is our

1212
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Trying to be

1213
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
I think I think

1214
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,375
Definitely coffee

1215
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Yes

1216
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Unsuccessful

1217
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Of course purpose

1218
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,151
North Korean dictator

1219
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:02,783
Topside

1220
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,319
New York

1221
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,879
Chicago

1222
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,655
Can you show me where

1223
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,263
Around

1224
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:16,767
Because he last out to break

1225
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,327
He really thinks that impression is funny

1226
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,983
He's really

1227
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
Yay

1228
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,591
Like a bad man but

1229
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
But also

1230
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,199
A guy who's on the quarter inch

1231
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:38,271
Turborower

1232
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:42,367
It's a bit doesn't develop it doesn't there's no

1233
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,695
Sargon anywhere I know where problem

1234
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,999
If you're doing this one

1235
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
You go all the way back

1236
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
22 like

1237
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
The Irish

1238
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
You go back to the

1239
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,703
The coppers

1240
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,543
Chirp the Box

1241
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,383
He's talking about

1242
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,175
The cops are aloof there bad cops

1243
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,199
See see it in their eyes

1244
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
2

1245
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
Reinforces ideas that

1246
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
It is

1247
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,535
The conclusion is

1248
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
If not

1249
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
Denial

1250
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
Denying

1251
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,727
So you gets into a metaphor about his dog

1252
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
Chewing wires

1253
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
This isn't an example of him

1254
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,359
Cuz he's telling the dog knot

1255
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Chew on The Wire

1256
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,991
I see the look in your eyes suspicious all the time

1257
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Don't

1258
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
Chew on those wires

1259
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:50,463
He's talking about the statue on the wires which

1260
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Don't

1261
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
His

1262
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
Jumps

1263
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
Back to the

1264
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
The shooting

1265
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
Is incredibly slow

1266
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:16,063
Do you don't want

1267
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Oh man

1268
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
That's unintended

1269
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Consequences right there that's that book

1270
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:42,687
Okay of that

1271
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
What are you doing izbora last

1272
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
Using the doerner shooting

1273
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:51,391
Hey this is what's going to happen to you

1274
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
If you try and take our guns

1275
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
Which is a

1276
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,255
Deeply f*****-up way to report on this story

1277
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,143
But that one person

1278
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,471
Every cop in America

1279
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
That's not a threat

1280
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,663
You know

1281
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
I know that he does

1282
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,015
This way

1283
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
Had those

1284
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,415
You know he had that caller called in talked about unintended

1285
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,255
We know that he is at least

1286
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,791
Professing to Everett

1287
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
And he certainly has like Express

1288
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,191
Connection with the Louis

1289
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,727
Resistance

1290
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,127
Is an apologist for Timothy McVeigh

1291
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,455
Is a lot of that stuff in there so you know that he feels this way

1292
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,527
Like if they trying to take our guns will all revealing that kill about

1293
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
You know that

1294
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
Decides

1295
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,671
To start covering a targeted

1296
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,487
Murder spree of police officers

1297
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
Police adjacent

1298
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,607
People that going story

1299
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
Assertive in example of

1300
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
This could be worse for you

1301
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
Future and take our

1302
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
That's f***** up I think you meant

1303
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,335
As a as a come

1304
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,967
At least you

1305
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
It's just one guy

1306
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
Target

1307
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,623
I don't like your glasses have told approach to this

1308
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,695
I just think it's that you know it's the wrong way

1309
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,047
It's the wrong way to look at this story

1310
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,119
Yes yes I agree with you

1311
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,239
Express that it could be

1312
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
Well yeah

1313
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,479
I guess or the reverse

1314
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,783
Do you have it could be fake

1315
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,671
It really undercuts all of his Meredith

1316
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,583
Telegraph

1317
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,895
If somebody

1318
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,575
Enforcer class

1319
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,183
Deserve

1320

So

Forever

1325
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,319
Has been yelling about how the DHHS

1326
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463

Bad yeah

1330
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,583
That represents

1331
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
A very severe.

1332
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,679
The idea of people who have military

1333
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Training

1334
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
Becoming insurgent

1335
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,543
In the Homeland

1336
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,079
Is a very real threat Alex

Tubi

People

1339
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:01,759
And now we have a situation where that exactly is happening

1340
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:02,783
And he say

1341
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,831
Well

01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,399
It's bizarre how predictable

1346
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,727
Additional

1347
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
It's not

1348
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Why

1349
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,567
This guy

1350
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,383
That he loves over

1351
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
However

1352
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,735
That can be used as supporting evidence

1353
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
Or anyone

1354
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,975
Well that's why he fits the profile if it takes until

1355
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
Basstoven

1356
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,655
But all he ever says specifically is like

1357
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,471
He wants gun control measures passed

1358
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
Sports Obama

1359
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
He likes Piers Morgan

1360
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:01,663
That's about it if that's all that your qualifications are for a deep psychological profile

1361
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,711
Of that a real shooter

1362
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
Did this is woefully

1363
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
Stupid

1364
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Yeah

1365
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Simplistic and

1366
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
But at this point

1367
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,439
Jump back to the asteroid party

1368
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
Because he realizes he hasn't covered

1369
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
This news

1370
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
They could be world ending

1371
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
Deserves to be cover

1372
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,959
Your last time you sort of being sarcastic about like

1373
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
You know

1374
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,543
Godzilla

1375
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,871
Thankfully this time he decides to approach the issue with class

1376
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
Aplomb

1377
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
Sears serious cover

1378

Asteroid Collision Course with Earth

1379
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,847
Yeah

1380
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,711
Away from the Earth

1381
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:11,295
Right.

1382
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:27,167
You got it

1383
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:38,431
Asteroids

1384
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,623
I mean

1385
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:50,975
Happy April first joke day

1386
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:59,935
Not a good joke too long is this cornball Astro

1387
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359
Call zoneaire

1388
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:17,087
Do you have dangerously close to that this isn't this is a weird

1389
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,903
. of time

1390
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
Bizarre

1391
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:27,327
Things to see on his show

1392
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,167
I mean I'm actually I'm actually happy that he went to

1393
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
Space invader

1394
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,007
Whatever it was for his

1395
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,567
Cuz

1396
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Sure

1397
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:44,991
Discogs play Bruce Willis

1398
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Also

1399
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
F*** you man

1400
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
You can't joke

1401
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,855
You did that you're online on Y2K

1402
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,183
Like it's almost like

1403
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
Trolling

1404
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
I don't know I don't know

1405
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,375
Is it like Russia was shooting nuke

1406
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,447
Stuff like that on Y2K like

1407
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,239
This isn't a parody

1408
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,031
Necessarily

1409
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,311
This is accurate

1410
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,175
15 years prior

1411
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,967
But we're back in 20

1412
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
He is a psychic

1413
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,599
That's okay always forget

1414
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Yeah

1415
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,927
It's on this episode here on February 8th

1416
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
Alex goes into overdrive

1417
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
He finishes up his

1418
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,791
Normal 3-hour show

1419
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,351
And then gets into the daughter shooting

1420
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,655
A little bit more in overdrive

1421
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:38,751
Is a little bit more explicit about why you think

1422
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
This one's real

1423
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
In overdrive

1424
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,471
Contouring your butt

1425
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
He doesn't really get that much more into

1426
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
To detail the

1427
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
It's just

1428
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,760
It's a very weird standard of proof to be like this doesn't help with a gun Grabber agenda therefore

1429
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:26,112
It's real by

1430
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
The guns are the problem

1431
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,656
And I don't care who is behind the gun killing people

1432
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,448
Heavily implies that Alex

1433
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
Is it Super 8

1434
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
Twisted

1435
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
Either

1436
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,360
The defense of

1437
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,384
Who's behind

1438
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,408
Yeah

1439
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,736
That's why they came up with the guns don't kill people people

1440
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
It's

1441
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
So weird

1442
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
Weird

1443
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
Because if he's saying

1444
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,232
This is real

1445
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
Because it doesn't

1446
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,304
Fit the gun Grabber agenda

1447
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
He has decided what that is

1448
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,936
He's created the parameters

1449
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,008
Everything

1450
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,288
But it also

1451
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,336
Implies that all it takes

1452
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
For something to be fake

1453
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:25,760
To him is with the definitions

1454
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,808
That's a low standard of proof

1455
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,856
Almost

1456
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,696
Not proof at all

1457
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
He's so close

1458
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
Too I'm just making this up

1459
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,144
Shockingly close

1460
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
I'm waiting it

1461
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,568
I'm paranoid freaks out about someone taking my gun that I enjoyed shooting yesterday

1462
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,408
About it

1463
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,432
That works for me

1464
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
But please

1465
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,992
Believe that I've read

1466
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,808
So it doesn't slip out

1467
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
Suggest

1468
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
Another reason

1469
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Why you say

1470
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
Is a real thing

1471
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
And that is

1472
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
Has to do

1473
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,328
Christopher

1474
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,480
Black

1475
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
He doesn't get to the

1476
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,904
I was looking for that key

1477
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,696
Feels like it would be right back

1478
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,304
Go Fish

1479
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,120
Metaphorically

1480
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,912
Alucard

1481
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
So he's StarTalk

1482
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,984
To some lady

1483
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
Who calls in

1484
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,288
Who

1485
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,824
Is the church lady

1486
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,128
But Alex is Matt and family

1487
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,664
He's known her for 7

1488
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,712
Years according to

1489
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:35,040
It's weird she talks about running into somebody I think

1490
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Supermarket

1491
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Talks about

1492
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,112
Soldier

1493
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Suicide

1494
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,696
Is it upsetting phone call

1495
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,256
Worth listening to

1496
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,072
2nd third-hand information

1497
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Great

1498
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
50cc into home Gab

1499
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,472
Yeah I just talked to you my phone number

1500
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,032
That's what he feels a lot of the time Overdrive

1501
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
As opposed to

1502
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
Chucky

1503
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,384
The end of the show

1504
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,944
He does half hour of overdrive

1505
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
This is the end of it

1506
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,064
All of his claims

1507
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
That's how you're going to

1508
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
Literally out to

1509
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,296
Empathetic

1510
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
And put that is

1511
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,352
Exactly what he says the media does

1512
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:59,520
Hey hey hey hold on that's when they do exactly

1513
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,872
Cries bloody murder about all the time

1514
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,688
Guilty By Association

1515
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:14,112
He cannot stop bringing up guys on Obama's border and that means it's a real shooting

1516
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
This is not good

1517
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,256
Shocking glimpse

1518
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,584
Turnabout is fair play

1519
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:29,216
But what if you changed it and said I'm going to unfairly only turn about you

1520
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,080
False

1521
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Call play

1522
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,968
Franklin Richards

1523
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,992
Situation

1524
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,040
I don't like this

1525
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,344
I mean I do it once

1526
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,208
Hit the way he covers things that matter

1527
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,768
Really deeply traumatic event

1528
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,304
Yeah there's even when he's

1529
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,096
Dealing with it as a real thing

1530
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,888
Still f***** up

1531
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,424
But I do

1532
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,448
Think it's very

1533
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Interesting and worthwhile cuz I don't

1534
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,288
I don't know the last time

1535
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,080
We've seen a major event

1536
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
The Tappan

1537
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,408
Discover today

1538
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,456
If it seems like the exception

1539
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
Not the rule

1540
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:16,320
And what it takes for it to be real

1541
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,392
All it is is I don't think it's ever again.

1542
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,696
Always an Obama supporter

1543
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,536
All it takes for him

1544
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
Which means

1545
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
The time that he thinks things

1546
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
Means nothing

1547
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
He's not facing

1548
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,080
I'm very interested

1549
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,872
See how this develops

1550
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
Over

1551
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,176
Time until

1552
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,248
Cuz it will

1553
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,576
I think the longer that goes on the horses argument

1554
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
I guess

1555
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
Cuz there is a sense of it that like

1556
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,696
The media will be going crazy about this if it was at

1557
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,512
Tea party guide crazy with it

1558
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,680
I don't know how this is going to hold up but I think it's

1559
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Because it stinks

1560
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,080
5 days after this chick started

1561
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,872
What is he doing

1562
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
I have no idea

1563
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
It's not

1564
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,992
So we'll find out

1565
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
What happens in a later at the

1566
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
For now

1567
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
Weider website

1568
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
It is now

1569
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,560
We are also on

1570
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,656
The other podcast

1571
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,680
Actual application

1572
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
Where else would

1573
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,104
Bugs are real.

1574
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
What up boy

1575
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,040
Let's see

1576
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,600
We don't have a lot of winners on this one

1577
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,232
I don't know probably did Kill

1578
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:03,072
What does vitamin C do

1579
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:03,840
Steam clean

1580
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,864
But I don't think it is

1581
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,704
Weird

1582
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,240
Cheese fries saving

1583
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,264
Lives ended

1584
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,568
At the same time be responsible for the deaths

1585
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:18,944
Possibly possibly

1586
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
Glenn Beck

1587
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,832
He probably not killed anybody

1588
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Alex Jones

1589
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,672
