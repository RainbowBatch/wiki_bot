1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

5
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,136
I love you

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
WhatsApp

8
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Start living room we got rid of the table that was there before we're able

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Took up all the space

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
Rearranged it's like we live in a new apartment I strongly recommend rearranging your place right now

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Went somewhere else at least for awhile you know what I'm going to do I'm going to say bye bright spots the same

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
Rearranged my apartment as well my bed to another location and I don't know why it's only a couple

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
Will beat away from where it was

14
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
So much less noise

15
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,800
I don't know how it's possible that in the same room

16
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
There's so much less noise a couple feet away sleep has been much less impacted by it's inside

17
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,808
Furniture moving both of our bright spots

18
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
You're you're stuck in a place

19
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
Make it feel like you're no longer stuck

20
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
I also I also decide to piggyback yours cuz I move my bed like a week ago

21
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Only thing I had in my mind was

22
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
I had some put it in the other day

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
I feel like that's not good

24
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
I don't remember the brand what's whatever those

25
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,832
Pudding cups chocolate and vanilla

26
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
It's not moving my bed was

27
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
So Jordan today we had an interesting episode to go over about the April 29th and 30th

28
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
2020

29
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Anza it's so ghetto I mean it's pretty tough

30
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Follow up

31
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
I don't know what you do is that

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
It's on the last episode on the 28th Alex is having a breakdown yelling about how he's ready

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,624
I need to eat his neighbors and dig the globalist out of their foxholes and eat them and so no matter what he does

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
No matter how crazy it is it's going

35
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Disappointment and so I regret to inform you listeners if you're expecting more cannibalism talk

36
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
You can't find it here

37
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,728
And for me that emotionally disappointed me tiny bit but there is still some stuff worth discussing

38
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
As we track this dark dark time for Alex

39
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
And his his business now I'm looking forward to thinking do every time we hear and take a bite of sandwich while color

40
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,808
You know what that sandwich abused neighbor

41
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
The Neighbors

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
Business thank you to

43
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
So first

Austin

45
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
Occupied Austin

46
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,008

Thank you so much and I'll probably walk

00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,768
Are you done sick like around 6 next antiques with Raptors

51
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
Thank you

52
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
You are now a technocrat

53
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
Laurel thank you so much you are now a technocrat

54
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
MSI tetra

55
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Thank you so much you and I were technocrat

56
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
We got to go

57
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
Money off that heroin

58
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Barge

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
Thank you so much John L Laurel

60
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Yes you can find in your area that's helping people and donate to them

61
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Wonderful

62
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
You did either

63
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
So Jordan we're going to take a quick detour here to check in with the year the seltzer

64
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
Richard going strong Khan like gangbusters

65
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,423
This point 25

66
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Notebook page

67
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,847
Bill what here's the thing I know that eventually it's going to slow down so you got to hit the ground running he's got to get as much

68
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
How much road behind you as possible

69
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
I am so

70
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
Today I got to highlight and lowlight I be honest

71
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
I've been having I found a number of varieties of a brand called Sparkling Ice at the grocery store

72
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
Hey by Maddie ice but I have to I have to report

73
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
No

74
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,167
No offense to Sparkling Ice they're all terrible

75
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:05,567
What baby daddy I could be there all like lacking and flavors are all just

76
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Really got meds attracted me to them was I was looking at the flavors they had

77
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
Amanda black raspberry and blue raspberry and raspberry

78
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,951
As I try them in about trash

79
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,023
I did not see one at the store but I don't know

80
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,399
Swing and a miss those were 32 and 33 out of 100 respectively

81
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
So that's something

82
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
Hey man highlight but honorable the kind of mentioned is Perrier Perrier strawberry and

83
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Orange and they're both great

84
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Okay yeah

85
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
Both coming in at 74 equal

86
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
Cousins like they're good

87
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
They have a strong crispness that a lot of other ugly Seltzer's that I've been trying or lacking

88
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
Do you feel like 75 is a benchmark

89
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
75 with another emotionally put them at 75

90
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,919
They are mind-blowing is nothing like really close

91
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
I feel like that's deserving of a 74 however

92
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Sparkling Ice

93
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
I got to go back

94
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,487
I'm not looking forward to it I have three more of them in the fridge three other flavors

95
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
3 degrees

96
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
StarTalk

97
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,167
Take selfies out the window when you're done with the day may come to look out for falling seltzer

98
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
So Jordan has been near the shelter report

99
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
Let's get down to it I got to tell you right off the bat the first half-hour of April 29th show

100
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Is

101
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Nothing

102
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Nothing

103
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,415
There is just Alex sort of normal and stuff that he says all the time

104
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,279
Liberals are evil global history of a liberal cities are run by demon

105
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
I found it completely usual

106
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,911
And it was quite a ways into the episode before I found anything

107
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
That even resembled something worth talking about

108
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
Standing that you cannot save a dental Society

109
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
You can reach out to some people trying to wake him up that's great

110
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
But you gotta move on

111
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Peopleready

112
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Dexter

113
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,391
Dust off your feet Let the dead bury the dead

114
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Do not waste your time on them

115
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
Build up those that do care build up those that do have a chance

116
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Love yourself

117
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,679
I know is a person that loves God and I know you love God as well that you really feel for people you can't wake up

118
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Broadcasting information everywhere but just

119
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Move on from that point

120
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Say behind in the system is dumb system

121
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Protect ourselves

122
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
Season of generally trying to wait. Before this got here

123
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
You just move on

124
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Country Club

125
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
The general public figures out

126
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
The contract of God was with Roe v Wade

127
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
The judge was coming

128
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
What's the General Public

129
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Figures out

130
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
We're in a long

131
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Long distance

132
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
It just gets worse and worse and worse for

133
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
Many many many years out of the future

134
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
They're going to freak out of me dangerous as hell

135
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Exploded

136
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Percent

137
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
5%

138
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Hell

139
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
On

140
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
Here's the beginning of the clip he's talking about like it's no longer the season for trying to wake me up

141
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
Yeah I don't understand information War where you're trying to wake up people

142
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
I guess the show is now just like okay I'm going to be talking to you while you're in your bunker

143
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,663
Has a really unhealthy kind of thing

144
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
If it's no longer about waking people up then

145
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,367
It's your preaching to the choir only

146
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
So also most sources you can find about crime rates

147
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
That you can find particularly right now

148
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
They provide caveat in these reports

149
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,959
Like how you can't necessarily attribute any changes and rates the immediate circumstances without further study

150
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Any person doing that would be kind of acting

151
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,591
He's to leave so just off the bat Shaky Ground

152
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:00,223
That's said a March 25th story out of WGN discuss crime rates in Chicago

153
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,343
Down 29% and shootings were down 19%

154
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,183
Also later in the article that discuss up

155
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:14,303
On April 3rd the hill reported on the drop of crime in crime that's been seen in New York

156
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
The Newark police department said Thursday the crime across all five of the city's boroughs and within the transit system in public

157
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Housing fell nearly 20%

158
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
For March 12th to 31st

159
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
And the second half of last month

160
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,223
Murder decrease 25% robberies fell by 10% and grand larceny dropped by 37%

161
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,855
There's some shoddy reporting on these statistics so you will find post on blogs talk about to jump

162
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
What they're doing is misrepresenting things

163
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
New York has seen an increase in crime when you look at

164
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
The year-to-date figures as compared to the same first-quarter numbers for 2019

165
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,447
That is true however it's irrelevant to discuss that when your point is trying to determine the effect of

166
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
City stay-at-home orders

167
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,639
Because in the. Of time since then crime has dropped drastic but you can only compare stay-at-home time with

168
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
That length of time

169
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
Basically compared to prior to

170
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,671
Tracing a causal link between it is is hasty

171
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
Also in that same article in the hill they just got to La crimes

172
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
Statistics homicide in California's largest city fell by almost 43% while rape drop by about 37

173
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Percent and robbery decline by 40

174
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
18%

175
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
I don't see any evidence that there's a giant surgeon crime and even if it were

176
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,919
That would be a massive contradiction of one of Alex's other big narrative

177
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
For years I was his primary love has been the gun

178
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
He just one true passion

179
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,903
And it's an Infowars Axiom that when there are more guns around there is less crime

180
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
Because the criminals know that you have a gun and therefore that leave you alone

181
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
March 2020 was the biggest month ever for gun

182
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
The FBI Ram 3.7 million background checks which is an over 1 billion increase from March

183
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
2019

184
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
According to USA Today fact-check this number background checks indicates an estimated 2.5 million gun purchase

185
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Which would represent an 85.3% increase year-over-year

186
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,135
So there's so many more guns being sold into the hands of Americans it according to Alex this should lead directly to it

187
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
Decreasing crime

188
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,535
However he's invested right now and scaring his audience so he's completely ignoring the increase gun sales

189
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
Any pretends the crime is soaring

190
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
He's basically is creating his own fabricated reality for his audience to live in

191
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,031
It's so fake that even contradicts his own already established fantasy world

192
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
It's Wyatt

193
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
Yeah there is one thing you was right about

194
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
I thought which is at

195
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
We broke our covenant with God

196
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:44,831
When Roe v Wade happened

197
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
They ruled on it and then the next day the Ark of the Covenant which as we all know is hidden deep inside the Smithsonian just explode

198
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
That's what happened why doesn't Alex at least get interesting with a covenant with God when we ended prohibition

199
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
What is the earliest go with a different

200
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Langevin

201
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Generic

202
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,127
Cookie cutter extreme right-wing Christian

203
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Come on man you better Alex

204
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
But you said you were going to eat people yesterday

205
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
Woodstock that's what it happened

206
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
Are not supposed to listen to band in bud

207
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
This is

208
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
In

209
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
The Bible

210
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Woodstock 99

211
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Everybody knows that

212
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
So Alex gets to talk about those I think it what we hear him say and what an advocate for

213
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Is

214
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Separatist communities

215
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
Telling people

216
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
Get yourself together you better get together with your family

217
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Get your asses

218
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
What the pilgrims did

219
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Europe to the new world

220
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
No it's not

221
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
And the pilgrims were kicked out

222
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
It's in far-gone

223
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,495
You just got to get together with your people to protect yourself

224
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Because it's going to be absolutely

225
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Wake them up

226
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Yes.

227
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,607
I still missed it

228
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
It's amazing the three years that you can real be like

229
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,543
Instills Bound by a rat break

230
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Eternally optimistic

231
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,151
Take that there won't be why there's some fact-checks here

232
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
One of them being with the countryside is not the new world

233
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:55,135
Those places are still under the the the laws

234
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Worry about that s***

235
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
I feel like this is a pretty unhealthy development for Alex to be calling for people to just create their own autonomous

236
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
And

237
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
I'm definitely not what I say we allow this to happen

238
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
Open we give them Idaho North Dakota South Dakota

239
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
I want to give the Patriots Dakota Arizona Arizona it's gorgeous

240
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
Southwest is fantastic

241
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Alright then we give the

242
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,767
Can we do that

243
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Thrown at you

244
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,823
We're not trading region trading regions

245
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,175
I think it's I think

246
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
The fact that we're hearing like Alex

247
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Discussing

248
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
The Infowars over

249
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
Start

250
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,647
Compound

251
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:07,071
Probably we should have seen it coming today but definitely what you would expect them to like Alex

252
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,631
Quote-unquote mature

253
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
But they are kind of cosplaying as zombie

254
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Think so why not

255
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,871
Why not do the next step of zombie apocalypse in

256
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
Build yourself an armored redoubt to keep all the hordes of left

257
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
I think that's one piece of it and then the other piece of it too is that like you know Alex's career started

258
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,927
Co-opting the tragedy at Waco for his own

259
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Sortos used

260
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
And it only kind of makes sense that inevitably once he started to get into a place where things were looking bad

261
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
He would seek to create more Waco's

262
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
That does sound exactly what how it would go

263
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,103
It maybe that's overly simplistic of me but it almost has a narrative

264
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Residents of the beginning and appears to be the beginning of his amp

265
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Yeah the story Circle

266
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
And I hope that's

267
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
The not what

268
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Would be nice if that didn't happen

269
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,463
First of all Janet Reno isn't around 2

270
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,095
Protect us I don't know if anybody would appreciate you saying she protected us

271
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
What's going on in the world right now

272
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Is

273
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,199
No it's a challenge but is your Alex what you see it as

274
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
HD culmination

275
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Decades of his life

276
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
This is what it's all been about the whole time

277
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
And

278
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Later

279
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
If he says something different

280
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Don't worry about it

281
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Age of research

282
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
Point right now

283
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
This isn't about me

284
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Last moment

285
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
Do this

286
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Can I get

287
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
So

288
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,375
Play Romeo

289
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,823
Microsoft Word tips

290
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
This is who I am

291
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
And this is what I stand for

292
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
What they destroy me or use me that's my body my spirit going to be gone

293
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
So perfect as of this narrative to establish when you say things that totally contradict yourself

294
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:44,255
Whatever I cut it to you or something try and save my own ass

295
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,863
Save my money or whatever they've got

296
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Tubi

297
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,031
Oh no you know what's worse is that they download the whole Microsoft Sweden there's right

298
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,895
You got to get the PowerPoint but still there

299
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
There they make me say that I use PowerPoint

300
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
I think I think it's brilliant for someone who's really contradict

301
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Type really appreciate that

302
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
If I'm ever called to answer for

303
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:24,703
My transgressions

304
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
That's

305
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
Building that allows you to like

306
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,663
Maintain the legend of your 20 years of service at the same time just being like got to go

307
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
So in the next clip Alex is talking about I like

308
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,087
I'm setting things up cuz it's over it is going down

309
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927
He uses the metaphor or I guess an aphorism

310
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
Idiom that's what I was looking for

311
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Completely wrong

312
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,191
Accounts with people

313
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Shopping to say hey

314
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Here's the news you need to know

315
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
So rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

316
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,087
Is an expression that used to describe something that is pointless 100%

317
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
Talking about is like Vidal or age was like

318
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
Hey we got to rearrange these pictures on the Titanic

319
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
The Titanic sinking

320
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
Quebec Tears Don't Matter

321
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
MedExpress

322
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,520
He doesn't understand we got to pick up our violins and play on the Titanic until the end

323
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,592
Sure we do

324
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:42,016
It's as if he fixed it like the people on the Titanic had a checklist years ago I can rearrange his dick.

325
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
Or on the off-chance this boat sinks we don't want it to be in disorder Wednesday we're going to look terrible

326
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Cameron comes down here

327
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,608
Tears of beterbiev

328
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:03,008
Yeah it's it's funny to me when he uses these expressions and it's just like wow that's the opposite of what that means

329
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:10,944
I do kind of feel like it's accurate just not the way he wants it

330
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
Whatever is happening

331
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
In his world is happening

332
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,088
There's not much you can do I don't think at this point

333
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
2

334
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,880
To write

335
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
A iceberg

336
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,560
Say What You Need to Say

337
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,448
The next clip Alex is talking about how's the world

338
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
They're happening and what's going to

339
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,616
Happen in the future as he foresees it we all deserve it

340
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,968
But if you really listen to it and you listen to a show with some regularity

341
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,624
I think you really can understand that he just thinks that he deserves some sort of punishment

342
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
Everybody else

343
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
We got a lot better chance of a baby

344
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
Waiting to see the universe

345
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Here comes the knives

346
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Look up the vacuum cleaner shut the back of head

347
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Whatever it is remember

348
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Babies went through this

349
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Going to take your legs

350
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,696
Because we summoned this

351
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,048
With all the devil worship in the corruption in the abortion

352
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,424
God gives you what you want

353
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
Unresolved issues surrounding the fact that he was involved in

354
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,456
Paid for multiple abortions he was younger

355
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
I mean talk about it

356
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
A ways back and you said it was like 10

357
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
Last episode 15 or 20 even if it's

358
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Maybe YouTube

359
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:02,816
I was knows but whatever the case is there's clearly some kind of

360
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:08,448
Unresolved psych issue there he has an intense amount of guilt surrounding that

361
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,824
He pretends he's forgiven himself in like God is taking care of everything but clearly not

362
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
And that is being put on everybody else

363
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
We all deserve this

364
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
It's f***** up it's just it's not appropriate

365
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:28,416
As far as narcissism goes the idea of guilt your own actions bringing death and despair across

366
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Everybody else

367
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
Pretty sure that that

368
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
Qualify

369
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,120
I was just thinking that there's an alternate universe out there where Alex Jones has 15

370
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
King 220 kids just

371
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
That that fought

372
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Really

373
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Weirded me out for a second

374
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Yeah I would be strange

375
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,552
That would be pretty strange I don't think his life would have gone the same way as a

376
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:00,416
I would I would assume that they're certain realities of that would bring into your life

377
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,256
Present difficulties

378
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,168
I don't know 15 or 20 people he's paying child support

379
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Is there would be 50

380
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
20 board lawsuits

381
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,568
This show sucks

382
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
This episode is garbage

383
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
What was the first hour is

384
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
Pointless rambling nonsense

385
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,600
We brought about we just be talking about stuff we talked about repeatedly

386
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
I don't really have any

387
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,952
All that much I want to get into on this episode

388
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,840
And it ends with about like an hour or so with with a guest and this guest is a dick

389
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,680
Is it just anti-vax nonsense I talked to a guy named Dale big

390
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Bri and we talked about him before

391
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
And I only want from this because I think it's just something

392
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
To call out

393
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,408
Valuable in the Ferrari

394
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
System setup

395
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,936
Working for somebody else

396
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
From that end and I've been involved

397
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
People support the work that I do

398
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,248
Bulshit and I don't really care I can't even pretend to be interested in

399
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
But

400
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
Their Dell is bragging about how he's independent

401
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,160
Other journalists media companies

402
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
The truth like he does

403
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,536
This is a fun thing to say but he's not independent not by a long shot

404
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Wendell says that there people that's

405
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,984
Support his work he wants the audience to hear that is him saying that there are people who make small donations that make it possible like are those nothing

406
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,616
But the reality is there are two people who supported work name Bernard and Lisa cell

407
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,760
Score hedge-fund multi-millionaires who bankroll a lot of the anti-vax propaganda

408
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,416
Bernard runs the cells Foundation selz which dispenses money to coach charitable causes that he support

409
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,792
Through that Foundation be provides approximately 70% of 75% of the funding

410
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:20,192
For the informed consent Action Network which is an anti-vax outlet that's run by his wife Lisa cells and

411
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Del bigtree

412
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,312
The sells foundation help fund the documentary vaxxed

413
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Which is produced and co-written by Del bigtree

414
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
And focused on this flawed and discredited work of Andrew Wakefield

415
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:36,064
Without the direct funding of the cells Foundation Del bigtree be a dum dum with a Blog

416
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,928
He's only able to do the damage that he does because of the support of multi-millionaire benefactor

417
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,000
Please also smart enough to know better than to discuss that

418
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Because it makes

419
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Super f****** obvious what his role in the world

420
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
Three comes on Alex's show and pretends that he's is

421
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
Thankfully people support my work

422
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
Fuckyourself Del bigtree you know the problem with a lot of journalist

423
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
But you know they're working

424
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
For other people

425
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,408
And I just wanted to be grateful to the cells

426
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,992
For allowing me to work for them and say what they tell me to say

427
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
I think that's great I'm really supported by two people only and I just really want you guys to

428
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
There is no conflict of interest there at all it's probably

429
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,400
Play negligible to the amount that comes through those foundation and and

430
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Interested

431
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Just it's

432
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Gaslight it's it's

433
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
It's abusive

434
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,080
To be like yeah I'm independent

435
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
No you're not

436
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
F*** off

437
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:36,480
Demeans the work of other journalists so much

438
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
You disagree

439
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Exactly exactly

440
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
So Alex comes back on the 30th

441
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
And

442
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,208
I should say that this is

443
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
The day that there is another hearing

444
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,120
In his bankruptcy case according to documents that I found from

445
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
I'm keeping up on the case

446
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
At this hearing

447
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
Alex's ex-wife

448
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
Had filed a motion

449
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
For Alex's

450
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Tire at state

451
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
And all of the entities that you own

452
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,760
To be put in the hands of a trustee

453
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
So at this point when Alex is on air

454
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
On the 30th

455
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
His lawyer

456
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
Is taken

457
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
Part in this case

458
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
Times that he's on air

459
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
There is a chance

460
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
Granted spoiler alert ultimately the court ends up deciding

461
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:30,496
That it's premature in the case get a trustee involved

462
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
But so they did

463
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Reject that motion

464
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,664
But it was rejected without prejudice means I can be reintroduced

465
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
The

466
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
I don't know

467
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,112
If that is part of Alex's mindset

468
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
I don't know how it couldn't

469
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,488
Three small chance there's a small possibility

470
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,560
Well he's on air everything he owns

471
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,912
The title will be taken and given to a trustee appointed by the court

472
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,264
That is a nerve-racking day

473
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,408
Not least because he might get the call while he's on air dancers

474
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,968
You know there's an added element to this to that like

475
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
This is going to go on a while

476
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,624
This case this court proceeding

477
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
Isn't going to be resolved anytime soon

478
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
But I don't

479
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,000
Feel like there's any way it's not

480
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
Part of what's f****** him up

481
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't know

482
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,632
Some people have speculated they reached out and thought that like

483
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
Yeah Rodger Stones arrest warrant

484
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
Shots are released

485
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
People worried about Zack being what Alex was kind of worried about in some sort of criminal prosecution regarding Nash

486
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,552
I don't think that's the case there was any kind of a charge

487
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,648
I don't know but I just I can't I can't get my mind around

488
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
The idea that like

489
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,024
The immediacy the Doom is somehow related to

490
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,120
Something about that I don't know

491
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Find it

492
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,192
Hard to believe that

493
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,776
Having a Sword of Damocles literally atop your head

494
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Wouldn't affect

495
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Recycle Hutch

496
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Clean Subway

497
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
And one that you refuse to talk about

498
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,272
You keep talking about other stuff behind the scenes going on that you can't talk about

499
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,648
There's one thing that I definitely know is going on behind the scenes you refuse to talk about

500
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Seems

501
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Like a candidate

502
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
Happened to releasing the names of those qanon

503
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,888
Didn't happen didn't happen how about the computer chip

504
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
What else has he got

505
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,752
He said he was going to sue the Associated Press

506
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,616
Said he's going to sue all sorts of people write didn't happen

507
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:50,016
So are we start here on the 30th and Alex's pretty extreme about what he thinks is going to happen

508
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
If you

509
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Yeah once there's a vaccine

510
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
The General Public

511
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Uniforms

512
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,376
Forcing forcing ovulation

513
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,032
Use a medical tyranny because they complained it's quote

514
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,408
This is exactly what I would do is

515
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:24,576
Oh yeah yeah

516
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Can real

517
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,744
Will you just scaremongering about discussions the governors have had about in the future if we're able to ease some of the closures in

518
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Social distancing measures

519
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,304
We will

520
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,864
Return to the containment model as it relates

521
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
The Coronavirus

522
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:43,008
This will entail an increase in the need for people to be employed in the process of contact tracing

523
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
Which is to say if they when there are cases of virus to pop up

524
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,712
People will be needed to investigate possible people they could have been they could have accidentally exposed to the virus

525
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
What was the job creation measure provided there's oversight

526
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Depends on who's doing the

527
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
Sure

528
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:07,840
That's it that's a relevant question and something worth that I keep an eye on Friday

529
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:13,216
Robert wants to compare that to the red guards that's his choice but it seems a little overly dramatic

530
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:19,360
It might be it might be that possible but I would say why not

531
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
Alex gets to rambling a brings up his favorite book

532
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
And I got to say

533
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Don't think

534
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,136
He knows much about his own favor Where the Red Fern Grows

535
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,744
I read none dare call it conspiracy

536
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
Oh yeah that's right

537
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Born

538
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
74

539
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Articles

540
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:51,360
The Rockefeller praising communism and now say tongue

541
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,432
I'm saying that he was going to bring communism to America

542
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,392
Blue is my man I very much doubt he went to a library

543
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
I further doubt that he looked up anything

544
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
And I greatly doubt that had he done either of those things that I don't think you

545
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
But he actually read those are two

546
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Sure there's an issue

547
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,008
Also I should tell you that

548
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Before

549
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
It was published in 1971 born because I think that he believes

550
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,272
Is it some kind of a sign of a cosmic plan

551
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,648
That was the year that these two really important pillars of the human resistance were both Unleashed or some s***

552
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:41,024
That's kind of my sensibilities ride to overly like dramatize this whole thing is a good meaning behind

553
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,936
I got I got that I got that vibe

554
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
Bruno's

555
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
No

556
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,592
Alex is misrepresenting what is in none dare call it conspiracy

557
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,480
There are references to articles about David Rockefeller trying to open up trade with the Soviet Union and China who the book

558
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,320
Call Zada Reds

559
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
It comes up a little bit short

560
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
Just to give you some idea of the level of s*** that's in that book hopefully we will do it

561
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,072
Breakdown of that book but

562
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,728
Here's a passage of what the author Gary Allan just decides to suggest that David Rockefeller did

563
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
Namely that he was Nikita Khrushchev

564
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Boss

565
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
A strange event

566
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
Occurred in October of 1964

567
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
From the text

568
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,600
Quote David Rockefeller president of the Chase Manhattan Bank in chairman of the board of the Council on Foreign Relations

569
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
Took a vacation in the Soviet Union

570
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
This is a

571
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:46,048
Peculiar place for the world's greatest imperialist to take his vacation since much of the Communist propaganda

572
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,144
Deals with taking all of David's wealth away from have been Distributing it to the people

573
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,984
A few days after Rockefeller ended his cool to vacation in the Kremlin

574
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,848
Nikita Khrushchev was called recalled from a vacation at the Black Sea Resort

575
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,432
To learn that he had been fired strange!

576
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:09,088
As far as the world knew Khrushchev was the absolute dictator of the Soviet government and more important head of the Communist party with run

577
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
The USSR

578
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,952
Who has the power to fire the man who is supposedly an absolute dictator

579
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,048
Did David Rockefeller Journey to the Soviet Union to fire an employee

580
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,704
Obviously the position of Premier in the Soviet Union is a figurehead with a true power residing somewhere else

581
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Perhaps

582
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
In New York

583
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
Really don't feel like that's enough evidence to

584
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,336
Approval

585
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:35,968
I think there's a lot of insinuation and maybe even circumstantial evidence that

586
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
Doesn't prove

587
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
Yeah

588
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,928
In reality Leonid Brezhnev had been trying to remove kruschev from Power since at least March

589
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
1964

590
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,024
He organized the conspiracy what you put in place in October

591
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,400
Put into action in October vacation after which Brezhnev roast

592
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
Staying so until his death in 1982

593
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,312
David Rockefeller had gone to Moscow and he did me with Khrushchev in July

594
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,128
1964 but there's absolutely zero evidence

595
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,688
It is isn't it anything to do with khrushchev's removal

596
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,784
From Power passed people like Gary Allan to speculating that it was related

597
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
It wasn't a vacation

598
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,624
I've Gary Allan suggest

599
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
And it didn't happen in October

600
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Also as Gary says

601
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
He's just wrong

602
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,512
Because he's not basing this on fact

603
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,328
Communist conspiracy lore

604
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,984
Suffice it to say that there's been a lot of information that's come out about this meeting between khrushchev's and David Rockefeller over the

605
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,104
Years has anything to do with khrushchev's Astor is completely unsupported by the historical record

606
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
But it doesn't matter

607
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Someone like Gary Allan

608
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
His book is meant to be persuasive so you can see how he Peppers his argument with leading questions that are meant to make the reader feel like bathe

609
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:49,184
Themselves are putting the pieces together when in reality they're being fed a load of b*******

610
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
!

611
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,792
It's the same thing that makes qanon so seductive for people

612
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
It gives them a propaganda narrative but simultaneously allows them to pretend that they're actually the investigators

613
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Pieces together

614
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,568
This is why this book was so damaging to the mind of a twelve-year-old Alex Jones

615
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,968
It's written intentionally to be read by people with less than Advanced reading skills and with a style that's so suggestive and

616
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
Repetitive drives points into impressionable Minds while maintaining an illusion that the suggestive

617
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
Mind suggestible mine

618
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,256
Is actually doing some kind of work to arrive at what is a predetermined conclusion

619
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
It's a book that

620
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
Keeps saying look at how smart you are a hundred percent hundred percent

621
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
I didn't do it I just gave you certain

622
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,032
Facts and you're the one who drew the

623
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
Conclusions problem all I said was

624
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:44,480
How strange! Without a? And it's it also like distilled

625
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Those things down into like

626
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Easily like

627
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,184
Like overly repeated little sound bites more less in the text

628
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,792
Do like make you remember that boy

629
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
And

630
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
We do need to do that episode

631
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,264
But it won't be one episode that's the problem

632
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
One thing that's holding me back from it is like

633
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:14,432
How long it would be

634
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
Is lockdown man we could do it

635
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Here's the thing that bothers me

636
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,856
About that is that it takes agency away from the Russians

637
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
To let space

638
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
Know how to cool the f*** out of s***

639
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:30,048
The past 150 years there have been like 42

640
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
They know how to cool man

641
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:38,240
Rockefeller fire crew shows

642
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,456
All this nonsense by that blew out his mind when he was young cuz he didn't go and look

643
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,736
Daddy finger

644
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Wealth Gap

645
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,856
Alex on the last episode on April 29th

646
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,672
Alex is talking about how like what's going on now is

647
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,976
The culmination of like all of his career

648
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,024
His career

649
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
All of human history

650
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,400
Besides interest exercises to Bible

651
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
Robin to these people

652
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,784
Spider species history

653
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
Will be

654
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
So what

655
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,976
It comes down to whether or not Alex lives or dies

656
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,120
Is there something that needs

657
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:43,520
To be done and if it's not done this thing

658
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Then hooray

659
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:50,176
What is a down that f****** road for the last time

660
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Who's roads with

661
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Is it destroying the UN

662
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,368
He fails on a lot of specific

663
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Check levels you know like what is it

664
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
To be done

665
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,768
Well it's destroy the globalist what do you mean

666
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Here's my quest

667
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,680
If his idea of what we should do is Retreat into these communes

668
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,216
I mean I'm sorry

669
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,312
Not copying whatever they re don't call it a cult

670
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,360
Then

671
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
How is it that

672
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
He would

673
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
Not survive

674
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Do you know what I'm saying like so

675
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,064
His whole idea is for him to live

676
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
As locked

677
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Is possible

678
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
Yeah pirate

679
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,488
At the same time he saying that if he doesn't die

680
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
Then Humanity will have lost

681
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,560
You have a good point

682
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
I think your addresses

683
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,912
I can't I don't have an answer

684
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,448
No I don't know

685
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,288
So I bet I think that's the way he wants this to feel like

686
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
Simultaneously and ultimate fight for the stake of human existence in all of human history

687
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,527
The future of the species and also

688
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,623
Yeah I am the butt of the spear

689
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,927
I'm just a radio host man

690
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:11,327
I think he wants to have it both ways like it's more fun to talk about the fight for human

691
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Future or whatever

692
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,679
But it's also not real

693
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:21,823
People come up to Alex people do not come up to Alex

694
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,663
Dammit he says this all the time it's

695
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,783
Constant it almost every single episode should also say I'm going to give Alex credit

696
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
Neither of these episodes does he storm off air

697
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,207
I was wondering that very question I was wondering

698
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
You know what

699
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
Steep raised

700
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
This guy stayed on air

701
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:53,055
I've got to convince that one of the things that you weren't covering on the 29th cuz we've dealt with it so much is that a storm.

702
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
No no I do think on the 30th he played a special report cuz he was taking phone call or something

703
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
But I don't

704
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
There's no infantry like

705
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,391
Hey Alex I got good news you get to keep your money for another couple of weeks

706
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:11,487
Sadly I'm not I'm not deposited but it doesn't storm off or anyting but

707
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,327
Or almost every single episode he talks about how people come up to him and they ask

708
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,703
How you handling things are you doing things are so top how do you handling things and what he tells them

709
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
You loves it

710
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
Every single almost every single episode he says

711
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Alex

712
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
How you doing buddy

713
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,047
Disagree that I strongly

714
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
Doxepin

715
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:54,751
Infowars is dying

716
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,847
Last days America

717
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
The real world

718
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,159
This is what we have become

719
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Goodbye

720
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,119
So yeah we're on our last days but it's America's last days because of

721
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
The same

722
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
Or something

723
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
So Alex gets to know talk about how much

724
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:31,615
So much Knew Too Much for him to cover some would say that there is but I will

725
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
I tip my hat to Alex

726
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,711
Yeah it does a really good job of explaining

727
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
The level of preparation he's done for this episode

728
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Why

729
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Emblematic

730
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
Conservatively

731
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Trump

732
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,919
Wwhl

733
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Is a

734
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
Only positive thing but it means so much and is

735
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
What about you

736
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
So

737
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,543
Iskandar over some of these articles any red

738
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
The couple of them

739
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
80 and over half of the man

740
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,647
Really came close to reading at that time to prepare I love it when he says like these articles in front of me these

741
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:53,535
Stacks of paper are props props

742
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
Yeah

743
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839
I'm going to

744
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:01,471
None of these because I don't remember much of what they said but I don't remember their headlines and their emblematic

745
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:10,687
Really gild the Lily on just not saying headlights

746
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
Looked at a few memes

747
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,015
I prefer articles with

748
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,599
Carpe donktum sent me something

749
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,975
There was a guy he was walking with his girlfriend a girlfriend that had a quote that was like

750
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,607
Dogs and then he had a thing there was like me and then he's looking at back at the girlfriend and it said money

751
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
And that way

752
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,751
I will say that I do believe that Alex could talk for 10 hours about temperature

753
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Drum set

754
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,919
About you is wrong I think you'd get very tired in the middle but I do think

755
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
You can probably do it if he had to

756
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,015
That's this this is the one thing I think

757
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,551
I bet if we is that

758
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
If there was going to be a 25th amendment kind of thing like today he's coming out and saying that they created it in the Wuhan

759
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
I did not see this

760
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
He insinuated it strongly didn't come out and say that he is saying that it came

761
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
From the Wuhan laboratory back

762
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
You could have told me like

763
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
Something like

764
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,383
Jobsite if there's a chance

765
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
That it turns you into a vampire

766
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
I haven't heard that

767
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
But I'm also a

768
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,783
You're making that up

769
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,183
I can't I can't tell with real or fake anymore without you can tell me almost anything

770
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,583
Give me a sec I got to look at my suggestions of the lab that's that's disheartening

771
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,191
The one thing we're eventually the 25th amendment is going to come into play where it's like okay

772
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:40,543
We're not going to start a war with f****** China over your b*******

773
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,151
I think it I think it's like once you get to the point where it's like a cause for war you kind of

774
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:51,807
Cuz it's made up now can't let things escalate to that level

775
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
You can

776
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Because people are f******

777
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Stupid

778
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
I worry

779
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
So Alex is thrilled

780
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,559
That's a trump is pointing the finger towards China and the WHL

781
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,423
Interesting the next thing that I would says about some of the Trump is doing

782
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Somebody should be very again

783
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Kind of glasses over it

784
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Checking into this

785
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
A lot of time

786
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
That's not something you admit

787
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
This is a nightmare right here

788
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Speed

789
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Coronavirus vaccine

790
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Bella Monica

791
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
The coronavirus coming rub patented

792
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Not ready to put in the

793
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
Solution

794
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
And Trump is going to roll it out

795
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,471
Belmont engagement whole thing I know the next piece of it

796
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:23,199
Trump accelerating the vaccine

797
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:27,039
This is a nightmare but I know why Trump's doing

798
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
Never explains why doesn't get into that story at all

799
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:37,023
Just pivots and moves towards talking about the nonsense about the chicken vaccine

800
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
The patent for

801
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
But he's insisting is this

802
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,423
Chimera virus on Trump right now

803
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Also

804
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Think that Alex must

805
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,103
Think that a vaccine is just to take a virus put it into black rubbing alcohol

806
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
Good

807
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,663
So many people think that

808
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
So many people think that seems to be all video

809
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
All of the chemicals that go into a vaccine to these people are like the dead virus whatever that mean

810
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Aliens and then just

811
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,655
Alexapure water filter is the filtered water and davirus you're good

812
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,959
That's why someone like Mike Adam skin like

813
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,775
Put out the Ebola cure that he did

814
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
Facebook just cuz you think it's dead Ebola right yeah you can hang out cohol about take a little alcohol in a bowl

815
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:32,063
Whiskey on their call Dakota cocktail

816
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,463
Mysterious mad anger doesn't transfer over to Trump reset is accelerating

817
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,815
Vaccine program but let's not worry about it cuz he understands

818
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,375
Explain and I don't understand what

819
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,191
Anyway Alex is mad at Bill Gates but

820
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
He is not

821
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Going to hurt.

822
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
You got understand that he's not going to

823
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Isn't he going to eat it

824
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,687
Later okay

825
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
Ncic evil thing you're going to go ahead

826
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,063
About to get hurt really bad if I want to eat

827
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
Stockholm Syndrome

828
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,423
Tummy bug

829
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Icopy

830
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
Greenbelt

831
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
Running to people

832
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Foot bypass

833
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,319
Digby running with mask on

834
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Jog

835
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
What is a running with Infowars

836
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,447
The wicked flee when

837
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
Live

838
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
Wobbling

839
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,823
Going along got them ahead but that

840
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
Training

841
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Here we go

842
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:10,111
Add 100000 sub tonight to run too many on the ranch

843
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,231
But I mean

844
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
Adelman

845
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:23,679
The Story Goes On while and it just has to do with that you like these cows and

846
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,471
Tell Kara.

847
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:31,871
More interested in the idea that his Grandpa took a government subsidy

848
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
He glossed over again as well

849
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:40,319
You know what I am starting to think that if they do develop a vaccine buy stockings

850
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
I think he might

851
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,487
Yeah I don't know you don't need to be mad at these people on the trail

852
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,047
Slip device

853
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
I don't know what that means

854
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:01,055
He sees people wearing masks and he thinks that their virtue signaling because

855
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
The premise is you wear these masks out of a courtesy for everyone else in public right

856
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,551
Virtue signaling cuz you are the math that's you saying you care more than Alex

857
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Who doesn't wear the

858
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
It's like that is

859
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Good

860
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,791
Well that would be like that would be like him saying when you're driving right is virtue signaling to look both ways at an inter

861
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Section you act like you're better than me because you pull it up. It is

862
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Stop sign

863
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:36,639
Weird it's very weird you're not understanding that is important cuz you could get hurt but as we all know

864
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,199
You don't need to wear a mask while jogging then

865
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
Jogging people

866
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,527
Can't transfer viruses

867
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,415
That is the one thing that the coronavirus cannot deal with unpleasant

868
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,999
To jog with mask on

869
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
But I don't know

870
00:53:54,047 --> 00:54:00,191
I don't know people make their own choices I don't know anyway Alex gets back to this idea to Bill Gates went on TV and said the

871
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,751
The 700,000 people will be hurt by the vaccine

872
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
The number to Bill Gates

873
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:10,431
Randomly picked out of the air to discuss the ideas of the difficulty of scaling of vaccine

874
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,199
Two large

875
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Population

876
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,111
Trying to cope with the idea that there may be some side effects to an effective medication

877
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,391
And how do you

878
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
How do you respond to that challenge

879
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:28,351
Alex has taken that to be Bill Gates threatening to hurt 700,000 people

880
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Is dumb brain

881
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Understand things

882
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,471
So you talked about that a little bit then this gets way off track

883
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
And

884
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
I think might end in

885
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,431
Something I've never heard Alex say but I think might be the root of some of his like

886
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,967
Deep-seated chauvinism

887
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Like is

888
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
He's like yeah

889
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
Feeling of like women or something other than men when is Mom picked them off the the knee

890
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Psychologically that might play a role in this is like a belief that he has that I've never heard that lie

891
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
Like what I thought like

892
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,287
I mean it's not as fun as eating people but it's as messed up

893
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:14,175
Oh yeah 700,000 people we get everybody this vaccine

894
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
Problem

895
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,695
Problem

896
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Play down everything

897
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,327
Oh don't worry they're going to pass laws you can kill that autistic son

898
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
It is the Sun

899
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,471
New your first more

900
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,919
Some girls with genetic studies get past the information

901
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,551
Men in the first generation are pack

902
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
Donpa genetic memory

903
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
What

904
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,863
Forgiven

905
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
I'm insane

906
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Play endolphin Active Duffy's Whatta Man

907
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,783
Women now

908
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,807
Worship

909
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Capitola Beach

910
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
This is f***** up

911
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:31,231
Apparently Alex's entire conception about race memory

912
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
And like you're at you are your ancestors

913
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
It did very

914
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,311
Very rare cases women did they become Queen

915
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,919
Study that says women some women Simply Clean

916
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,711
They turn out to be Queen

917
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:58,111
But otherwise it's the first born son killed

918
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
Suncommunity killed the genetic memory

919
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,743
I don't think that was what was going on in that story

920
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,815
Maybe that's what he was thinking

921
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Yeah

922
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
Does he have brothers

923
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:20,895
I know he has a adopted sister

924
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,247
I would see if he has venetic members that I don't I think Alex has another sister

925
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
I've always kept

926
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
So much of a hands-off thing with his personal life

927
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
I tried probably know a lot about his family members but for the most part it doesn't

928
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
Interest me at all

929
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
And outside people like Buckley

930
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:49,055
Was on out to show a bit of like what I would look

931
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:53,663
He's like a DJ and s*** right I don't know his family

932
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,735
Like size or

933
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:03,135
He talks about his adopted sister a lot when he wants to pee or not racist

934
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,207
I've heard him talk about another sister so I think he's the only

935
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Mail song

936
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:13,631
Was he who now I'm now I'm trying to remember because I think the story remember the story where he's under the house

937
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,471
Sprayed with all the chemicals we got one of those people is one of his brothers

938
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
9

939
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,615
So is cousins don't have any genetic map

940
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,271
At least

941
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,575
I would like it written down I would

942
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Cuz guess what

943
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
It's not in the Buy

944
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:41,535
Science literature

945
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
Alex Isley

946
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:51,263
Talks about it it sounds like something he firmly believe that and thinks it's almost

947
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
Like

948
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:58,687
Pointless for him to say cuz it's so obvious

949
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Talk about these sorts of ideas a lot I've never heard him say that it doesn't apply to

950
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,671
Only the first born son

951
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,951
That's f***** up that's

952
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
Crazy

953
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:17,887
So what happened what happens whenever a father doesn't have any sons the whole line lose their

954
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
Memories

955
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,191
That's crazy

956
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:26,591
This is this is also kind of explanatory power about Alex's of

957
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,639
Persian to women

958
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
Sucks because it's

959
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,015
Show me the bad reason to be leaders

960
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,343
How could they be leaders they don't have

961
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
It's only it's almost immediately

962
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
Women are second-class citizen no it's not even almost it is immediately women are automatically second-class citizens about

963
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,887
Unless they're Queens you have taken over enough for you to respect

964
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
Right so Beyonce

965
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,983
She's got well for Alex no

966
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,079
Millie Weaver

967
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:03,455
Katie Hopkins Lauren Southern for a while

968
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
For a bit

969
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Man maybe

970
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,159
She didn't defend her Hitler comment probably lost erase memories. Whatever

971
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Weird things

972
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:18,303
Look so it doesn't slip Alex yells a little bit about how you can't sell out but you just can't do it

973
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
I don't like

974
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,191
The store for me

975
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
To defeat these people

976
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Commitment

977
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
Species going on for

978
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:45,439
So honored to be your happy

979
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
Or something you gave up

980
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,583
What you do take me for what I do

981
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Computer chip

982
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Betray

983
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,503
Brody

984
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
War

985
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:22,047
It's cuz I'm alive

986
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
Day I die my soul.

987
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,495
Will not be damned to hell I will get away from me

988
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Planet

989
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
There's a pretty part about it

990
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,759
How to control the universe

991
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
What I get

992
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,159
Call the other people that are good

993
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,463
Imagine how good that's going to be

994
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,423
My grandparents

995
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
U r g

996
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,567
The level above human understanding

997
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
Interface with them

998
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,735
That is what this is all about ladies until when is the next level

999
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
Why you cannot

1000
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,319
Now in fear

1001
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,623
They are

1002
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Start of the shower I told you that

1003
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Saturn

1004
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:43,455
You did by saying obvious everything is but he kind of

1005
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:50,111
Talking about how he's going to die and meet his grandparents

1006
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,767
Tax subsidies to not raise cattle

1007
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
The Coalition Builder

1008
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,375
I don't think Alex is really 101

1009
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,447
I just don't think he's willing to really meet people on there

1010
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
No no boy

1011
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:11,103
Yeah my reward I don't have to hang out with people who disagree with me

1012
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
This is unhinged

1013
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
It's boring though yeah

1014
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:25,183
It's it it's weird like our last episode

1015
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,207
Set back by like

1016
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
Where's

1017
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:35,679
In the same way I take some really hot thing for me to enjoy spiced because I've had so much spice so much

1018
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:40,031
In my life

1019
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:45,151
Him talking about how he's going to die and meet his grandparents and all this stuff it in like

1020
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,735
Relish the torturing cuz I can't sell out

1021
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,575
Whatever Alex

1022
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:58,463
He thinks he's a journalist show

1023
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,303
That's always difficult to remember

1024
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,423
Really take the time to like really telescope out like really zoom out

1025
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
Recognize

1026
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,543
And I mean I think I think we did recent episode it bears

1027
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
Bring up

1028
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:19,199
Pretty regularly like imagine the sort of behavior from literally anybody else

1029
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,479
Think about how f******

1030
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,759
Farcical it is

1031
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:22,783
Bananas

1032
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:29,183
I also I think we can only really get into his bizarre cosmology now whenever he should face just because of the four way

1033
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
To learn things

1034
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Where it's like

1035
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:36,095
You're going to have to bring some kind of even more esoteric nonsense than just that

1036
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
I I mean

1037
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,703
Noteworthy to say that the first born son gets

1038
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,495
Genetic memory but if he was drunk

1039
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
Man we get some real good s*** out of that he's been drunk he hasn't specified the firstborn something right

1040
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
That's what I'm saying he's got to be drunk to now

1041
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,159
Oh man don't drive home

1042
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Don't drive home

1043
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
The trying to get you

1044
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,839
So Alex talks about things you can't talk about

1045
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
Man

1046
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:15,263
I'm broke

1047
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
John today

1048
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
But

1049
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,455
You judge a man by his enemies

1050
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
Play these criminals

1051
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,927
Shut their mouths off things they did or just

1052
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:40,095
High-and-mighty people at the Clinton foundation and the Soros group

1053
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,423
Don't know people are like him stuff and given us documents

1054
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,031
Don't know that when they really make moves like that

1055
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
Don't

1056
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
World

1057
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,687
Pissed

1058
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,503
Run the lockdown

1059
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Point

1060
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
You're going to have everyone turn against you

1061
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
You don't have your robots enforce yet

1062
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Yet

1063
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
Make sense

1064
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
You got the jump on you

1065
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Truly amazing is God is in charge

1066
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,991
Got to give it all the God I know you got to give it all to God I don't want any cryptic here

1067
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Let me let me let me do that

1068
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
Last night in this morning

1069
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,927
Getting racist broadcast

1070
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
On

1071
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
Believably insane

1072
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Agreed

1073
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,959
Is the head

1074
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
The world food programme

1075
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,823
Any says 130-plus million people are set

1076
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Farm desk

1077
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
So I don't know anything about those imaginary Soros documents Alex's claim people are leaking

1078
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,295
Usually is not even close to a breaking story

1079
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:09,695
And he doesn't have any updates on it any other information to bring the tables

1080
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
Like a breaking development

1081
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:17,887
Whatever is going on behind the scene I can't get away from the awareness that this day

1082
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,679
Behind the scenes

1083
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,215
He knows that his

1084
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
Lawyer is

1085
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
In court

1086
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
For a bankruptcy hearing

1087
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,919
Like I can't I can't disassociate the two things

1088
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
Big developments behind the scene

1089
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,807
Bring us to Soros documents or shut up

1090
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
Your argument

1091
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Is that

1092
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,415
The globalists have one

1093
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Completely

1094
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,975
Yes but they also

1095
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,071
Sprung this too soon because they don't have their robots in place

1096
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,375
So the globalists are also stupid

1097
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,679
Play one and they still beat you

1098
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,007
Yeah they won without their plan I guess

1099
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
Yeah that sounds about right

1100
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,383
Oh man Alex you suck it

1101
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,943
Your job if your job was to win

1102
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
They give you an old goal

1103
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,063
They gave you an own-goal and you still on

1104
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
Bossman Alex

1105
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
That's Tuff

1106
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,695
So Alex

1107
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,999
Talking about like how he has over

1108
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,023
He's like really

1109
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
McCobb

1110
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,143
Weird things he talks about on his show like maybe

1111
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Eating people

1112
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Yeah

1113
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,727
Maybe some stuff like that but like

1114
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:32,127
He's not responsible for any of that stuff all these sick fantasies and all these weird things that he talks about

1115
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
He didn't come up with any of that

1116
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
Protein powder

1117
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,655
00

1118
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
Babies and

1119
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
Death and destruction and just

1120
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,271
Play look at me and say

1121
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
This guy says were bad

1122
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,647
We just want to social distance to save human life

1123
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,207
The leader of your group Bill Gates

1124
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,535
Depopulate the planet and kill all the old people

1125
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
Particle son

1126
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,639
Iran's off of the family inheritance his Dad gives it to him he comes back a decade later

1127
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,991
I got part of parents in the first-borns running everything great

1128
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
He comes in

1129
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,111
It says why are you throwing a party

1130
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Calf

1131
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
Brother when he's a loser

1132
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:54,559
Oregon 10 years around

1133
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
What

1134
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,287
We got to make him feel good

1135
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
What he's done what

1136
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
Might be

1137
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,807
That's not the reading I got it from him

1138
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:19,647
The mainstream reading that is

1139
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:24,767
Prodigal son story is about placating and make it the Prodigal Son fuel cool

1140
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,815
I thought it was about how like

1141
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:31,423
My son who was dead is alive again we celebrate this

1142
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Kind of about the

1143
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,567
Durability undying misses love and connection

1144
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,103
I don't know

1145
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,455
I mean basically the older brother is a fool

1146
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,503
In the story because he doesn't

1147
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,831
Supposed to be the point as far as

1148
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
Every reading I've ever had it

1149
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,159
Here's where you're wrong

1150
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,231
It's about what is not in the Bible

1151
01:10:55,487 --> 01:11:01,631
You missed was the sudden decided that the father had was like don't worry about it I love you

1152
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
So much more than this

1153
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,703
Assholes we're just

1154
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:11,103
Look we're just going to have a party and then he'll work in the Stables all over against back in talking if you have this

1155
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:17,247
Exactly is a mob story

1156
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:24,159
Okay I don't interesting to me about Alex

1157
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:30,559
He's told the story of The Prodigal Son a number of times that sometimes he's close and sometimes he is

1158
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:36,959
I feel like this one is pretty far off are you off

1159
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
Here's my reading of the prodigals

1160
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,287
Love isn't real

1161
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,871
And your parents are always lied to his my reading of the Prodigal Son

1162
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
Duchene to come back

1163
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,735
Get a great life

1164
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:55,135
He had a great life out there outside of the wing of his parents who you moving back in with your parents are you Michael

1165
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Rotondo

1166
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,207
Vicky has a complicated

1167
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,071
Perhaps

1168
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:06,143
If it's nightclub Alex talks about

1169
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,703
His own understanding of what he

1170
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,031
He does and what his place is in terms of the greater picture

1171
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,847
Of the world and I think it's fairly

1172
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:18,431
It's accurate it's kind of revealing that he has

1173
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,015
The best

1174
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,999
Doesn't have a way to go into the general

1175
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
He does who's the president

1176
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:42,751
Used to quote radicalize the military the police

1177
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
The General Public

1178
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,103
Completely outlandish

1179
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
Publix

1180
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Power

1181
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,351
Always 100,000 people a million whatever

1182
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
All this

1183
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,335
Am I inside their heads lowered simpatico

1184
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:24,479
So he's not right about any of the contents of that but I do think I mean he's fairly accurately diagnosed

1185
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:27,551
His position and that is to radicalize enough people

1186
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,879
To give cover for some sort of a right-wing leader

1187
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,183
To enact authoritarian moves

1188
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,511
Like that is basically the the function

1189
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:43,167
And I think he on some level whether or not he's fully cognizant of it that's what he's

1190
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Express

1191
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Like he's pink

1192
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,055
Well you presenting that he thinks the things that he saying are true

1193
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,639
And so there's some sort of a noble

1194
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,199
But all in all it really is is

1195
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,503
Create enough confusion and enough

1196
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,343
Fundamental distrust of reality that someone

1197
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
Can exploit that

1198
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
To consolidate power

1199
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
That's the function that Alex is serving

1200
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,511
My job is to create

1201
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:14,911
A right-wing Christian Isis so our dear leader can exterminate

1202
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
Play people who disagree with me

1203
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Cool

1204
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
More or less

1205
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,871
In his next clip Alex plays some theme music that I haven't heard

1206
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,015
On his show maybe I kind of enjoy. The Highwaymen

1207
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
But it is country

1208
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,623
Okay and it leaves Alex to have a little bit of a wistful moment

1209
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:05,343
Whoever on that range up in the sky

1210
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:15,839
I don't hear the cry

1211
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,423
That's almost listen to it

1212
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
Backboard somewhere

1213
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,079
Just listen to music like that then f****** go

1214
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Down here

1215
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,271
Cuz I did a lot of preparation for the show

1216
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Already proved you then

1217
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
Look at all this nose

1218
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,951
And there's just an apocalyptic

1219
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
At this point in the show Alex I don't know if you can tell just from through the pace of his speech but he's taken a real likes

1220
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,191
Assertive

1221
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,263
Yeah there's a down note

1222
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
2

1223
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
Play it's a it's a it's a notable

1224
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,663
Dog starts talking about how we need to do something

1225
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
What do we need

1226
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
Well it's interesting because he doesn't actually say what we need to do but something needs to be done

1227
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,903
Is it right-wing gun nuts

1228
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:18,303
Storming believe it talk about the idea of gauges in

1229
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,839
A bit of stochastic terrorism

1230
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:26,495
Inspiring people to extreme acts while haven't plausible deniability in his language

1231
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
When I hear this clip

1232
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,335
I can't escape that

1233
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Feeling

1234
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Very strongly being in my mind

1235
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
I'm saying this

1236
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,271
Call TR scared

1237
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
Never had a clear Target

1238
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,439
What do we do

1239
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,815
Getting up here and always telling you what's going on what's Happening

1240
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,351
Ninety-nine percent of the time

1241
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727
Eat people

1242
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,383
Naughty people

1243
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,271
You got to do it

1244
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,831
Somebody open and do it

1245
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:21,791
Real quick don't do heart surgery after just reading a manual on heart surgery need to give

1246
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,607
This sort of public service announcement

1247
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
The heart stop

1248
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
Cesarean they did

1249
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
Po-boy

1250
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Where the mother died

1251
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,991
Where the term cesarean formisano Cleopatra weed-out

1252
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
Marc Anthony

1253
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,831
The baby wouldn't come out

1254
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:49,439
And I done the surgery before but it wasn't cesarean visit was experimental in

1255
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
What

1256
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
You got to do it

1257
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
I can't take your money

1258
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,903
You got to do it

1259
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,767
You got to try

1260
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:31,167
I don't know what

1261
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
He's talking about

1262
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
Explain when he comes back from break

1263
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,311
I don't know what the Cesarean metaphor is about

1264
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
I don't know what the like

1265
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:44,735
The thing that troubles me is the language that surrounds it of you we don't want to do it

1266
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,271
But you got to do it or full

1267
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:50,879
Cuz it's up to some of the things we talked about not wanting to do all the time

1268
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:55,743
Even the examples he gives all involve knives and cutting people open

1269
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
Sure

1270
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:03,167
Implicitly violin

1271
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,775
We don't have a manager we just write Immanuel we need to cut a guy there

1272
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,639
That's Alex's believer

1273
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,919
That's all I'm saying

1274
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,223
Like maybe we don't skip to the

1275
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,551
February

1276
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,111
Okay I but you don't have any

1277
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,207
I just opened this team can I have the lid

1278
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,255
Good novice clean clean

1279
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:33,119
Let's do it I put a little fire on it in scalp

1280
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Oh yeah those things are Sharp

1281
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:38,495
DIY surgery manual

1282
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
Yeah that really troubles me

1283
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,687
I think that the vibe that he's putting out is very much something that could be misinterpreted

1284
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,759
Goodbye more unhinged elements within his audience

1285
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,599
To be very clear tacit support

1286
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,695
Right-wing Terror basically well I mean based on

1287
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
Polling information it's like what

1288
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:06,655
Less than 10% of the country people adults think that

1289
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
We should reopen the country like

1290
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:13,055
It is so minuscule that the only reason that these people are pushing it so hard has to

1291
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,384
To be so that incredibly small minority finds a way to

1292
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,152
The influence

1293
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,480
The 90% of us that think they're insane

1294
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:24,320
And the only way that 5% is going to do that is with

1295
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
Peaceful coexistence

1296
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
Probably not doubt it

1297
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:35,328
So in the next clip Alex is talking about one of his favorite things and that's quotes and this one might be real but

1298
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:41,728
It also might not become clear children

1299
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:48,128
States of America

1300
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:51,968
American Taxi

1301
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Bulshit

1302
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:58,624
If there's anything you represent it's a childish drunk American

1303
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:04,000
But you already broke the Covenant in the enrollment wait so

1304
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:10,400
God doesn't even love America God loves drunks children Americans

1305
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:16,800
And I am a child of drug America

1306
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
Trifecta

1307
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:23,200
So there's some dispute whether or not on Bismarck actually said that line or if it's Miss attributed to him

1308
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:29,600
There's a decent chance he did say it either way even if he did it's a paraphrasing of along pre-existing French

1309
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,368
Proverbs

1310
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
Also the original meaning of that thing is

1311
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:39,072
Not a compliment like that God loves drunks children in the US more than God loves others God looks

1312
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:45,472
After the US in the same way God looks after drunks and children because they can't look after themselves

1313
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,056
Yeah it's yeah it's 100%.

1314
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,128
It's you have the ability to defend yourself of a

1315
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,176
Drunker a child and the most

1316
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,528
Abnormal lock the most American thing you can do is take that as a compliment

1317
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:04,928
Exit you should be draped in an American flag while shooting a stranger

1318
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,464
Exactly what I wanted to hear

1319
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:14,400
What others going through these two episodes I found myself profoundly bored and there wasn't a lot of things to latch onto

1320
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,960
Here on the middle of the April 30th episode

1321
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,264
I found something that it showed

1322
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,032
Promise

1323
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,360
And that is italics decides to get down to business

1324
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,408
And talk about this conspiracy

1325
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
That he is against

1326
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
And

1327
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
Boy

1328
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
If you want a history lesson

1329
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
Recommend

1330
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
You go to school

1331
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,160
If you don't want a history lesson

1332
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,976
Listen all right

1333
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,584
Let me just try to quantify this in a scientific way as best I can

1334
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
The decision was made

1335
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
2300

1336
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,456
Okay alright

1337
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
Appalachia order

1338
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Autocracy

1339
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Sure

1340
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:10,208
That would keep me from knowledge and empower the establishment

1341
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,232
That sounds right

1342
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,912
From that has been an extension 2300

1343
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
F******

1344
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
Excited

1345
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,752
We are going to

1346
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,800
To get him really trying

1347
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,384
To break things down alright this is what happened in Greece now

1348
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
Flash Forward 20 years

1349
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:36,832
Ostracized some leader

1350
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,160
Excited I thought that was going to happen share

1351
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,184
No

1352
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:46,304
Alex makes a gigantic leave immediately Everest

1353
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:51,168
Bigstar 2,300 years ago

1354
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,448
And yesterday

1355
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:00,384
2300 years ago in Greece it started a sort of autocracy. Keeping information

1356
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,152
Meatballs

1357
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,480
I swear I didn't cut out 15 minutes where he explains things

1358
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,784
It jumps to the Black Plague

1359
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,232
40% of population

1360
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
The old corrupt establishments get devastated

1361
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,144
Christian's will Christians are able to get ahold

1362
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
Private businesses are

1363
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
And the really

1364
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,920
The Gutenberg Press is

1365
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:41,088
So it's a massive jump from 2300 years ago to the time bubonic plague

1366
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:45,952
Through those hundreds of years

1367
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:52,352
So after yada yada in history

1368
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,888
Who started the first public businesses

1369
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,656
Private business

1370
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
Excuse me

1371
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
I don't know about this

1372
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:00,544
Given that's a pretty well understood part of history that the Dutch

1373
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,360
East India Company was the first company to offer stocks

1374
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,688
I wasn't talking specifically so I don't know what

1375
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:13,088
Actually meaning by this but I don't think you should be thrilled about the East India Company based on literally all of his pretend beliefs

1376
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
Furthermore

1377
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
Christians at the time

1378
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
Very against the Gutenberg Press

1379
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,816
To the point where they burned a lot of them down that's interesting too

1380
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:29,472
Also the Black Death didn't happen 500 years ago it took place between 1346 and 1353

1381
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,800
A few weeks ago press was invented in

1382
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:39,200
50 it should be noted that the Chinese have developed movable type printing as far back as 917 ever heard

1383
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
1200 books

1384
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,808
Very common items Society

1385
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:50,208
Alex's stories by human progress in this lineage of Destiny and all of this makes sense if you pretend that Nan

1386
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,512
European history doesn't matter or it didn't happen

1387
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
Alex talks about the human Journey he specifically excluding all other cultures Journeys in history

1388
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:02,496
Because ultimately he doesn't see them part of his part of the human story

1389
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:08,128
It's really pretty sad and at the end of the day represents a very explicit undercutting of his pretend Quest

1390
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
To bring Humanity to the next level

1391
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:14,784
He'd sooner call for the end of the world that accept non-european cultural Primacy in it

1392
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:20,416
It's clear when you hear these things I thought was really interesting about these two days

1393
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,208
Is this sort of thing

1394
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,744
Really highlight

1395
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:29,632
This part is like the non-european elements of History don't matter they don't

1396
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,704
It might as well not be a part of our story

1397
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:38,080
Exclusionary to pretty much every other culture and that means that you are not

1398
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:42,432
Humanity you're interested in

1399
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,736
Then you have him

1400
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:51,136
The reveal of the firstborn male child is the one who gets the race memory

1401
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
Excluded

1402
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,464
Pretty much all of women

1403
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,000
There is that yeah

1404
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:03,168
Exclusionary even Within These two days that you've whittled it down to exactly what we know Alex is

1405
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
Is always cared about

1406
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
What does

1407
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,544
Yeah yeah

1408
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Oh man

1409
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
I think it's fun that he even skipped over in this globalist agenda

1410
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Autocracy was beginning

1411
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,296
You skipped over the part where Jesus showed up

1412
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:25,952
Not interest not involved in the in the blue dock receive the good Christians didn't even bother with the Jesus history

1413
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,280
Very boring

1414
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:34,144
There was there was Grease there was the Black Plague

1415
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,192
And then there was a few days ago

1416
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,264
Great events of History absolute

1417
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,312
The Gutenberg Press happened

1418
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,104
And now

1419
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,920
I guess the bad guys they want

1420
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
The Gutenberg Press or something

1421
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,992
The Gutenberg Press

1422
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:49,760
Is

1423
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
Here we go

1424
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,744
Empowering for

1425
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,168
But you're seeing the authoritarian

1426
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
Take control of that now

1427
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,288
The Gutenberg Press

1428
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,944
I mean I think the Gutenberg Press absolutely change

1429
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,504
There's no doubt

1430
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,040
Without question

1431
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,368
Torn would not have been circulated as far as his wide

1432
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
If there wasn't

1433
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,184
The Gutenberg Press

1434
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:35,584
Yes that's the number one thing I can think of the Congressional Record

1435
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:41,984
Everyday by movable print it was it is it is interesting that the Bible and p******

1436
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
Both went along the same network

1437
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:49,152
Do today Gutenberg Press it had to be underground because the Catholics wanted to destroy all of it

1438
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:55,552
What what Alex is trying to get at I mean I understand what he's trying to express and that is that like the legacy of the

1439
01:28:55,808 --> 01:29:01,696
Gutenberg Press is the availability of information because he's kicked off Facebook somehow now

1440
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,936
I don't understand it as like a real thing

1441
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:18,080
I don't know I think this is in the same way that his entire understanding of history is

1442
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,896
Depressingly eurocentric

1443
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,944
Is is understanding of the

1444
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
The present is seltzer

1445
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,808
I just don't have time for it

1446
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Also

1447
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:30,368
That's about it

1448
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:33,952
In terms of his lesson of History like it's really like

1449
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:40,352
I got so excited when he said like 23 years ago this all started

1450
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,936
2200 Peloponnesian War

1451
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:48,800
And that was to defeat the plutocracy because the acid

1452
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,848
And what would he loved more than this

1453
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,432
It's right Battle of Thermopylae was false flag

1454
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,992
Do you know that I did not know that

1455
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,088
Globalist

1456
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,392
Mister

1457
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,512
Please he was also a globalist of course

1458
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,304
Alright babe alright we did it

1459
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,888
So Alex

1460
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,984
Like sort of reason to exist right now is to train and all of the

1461
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,568
Like business closures and all that stuff

1462
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
Explain

1463
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,896
You said that you should do that for a selfish r

1464
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,480
I want to be very very careful here with everybody

1465
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,392
We do not stand up

1466
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:40,000
Hundreds of millions of people that will starve to death

1467
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
In the next

1468
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,560
Year 22 years

1469
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
Lockdown

1470
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
What's happened

1471
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,032
Cloudy design collapse of civilization

1472
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,592
Industrial world

1473
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,432
And and the Rockefellers and Bill Melinda Gates administer plan

1474
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
From a selfish person

1475
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Active

1476
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:12,768
You will be reduced from your hoity-toity Rich Western Society to third world

1477
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,304
That's all

1478
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
Argument

1479
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,352
Already have

1480
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,984
It is said his position Justice

1481
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
Ludacris nonsensical

1482
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,824
It's

1483
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
I think it's just

1484
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,920
It's just so disappointing

1485
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:35,040
It's so disappointing because I really want him to flame out with more eat people

1486
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,856
He's not flaming out he's he

1487
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
Flickered violently and now he's going to slowly remind can I tell you what my thought was after that episode

1488
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,328
Reflecting on it

1489
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Publicity stunt

1490
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:53,472
I think that was his I think he was hoping that you get a lot of coverage if you really like

1491
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,032
Alex Jones to Sadie's going to eat people

1492
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,896
I think that that might have been somewhat calculator.

1493
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:04,224
Just the way I mean who knows

1494
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
The reality is that he could be such like

1495
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,832
Rapid Cycling kind of

1496
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
Outburst

1497
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,672
Could come suit like

1498
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:19,072
Randomly

1499
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,376
The most boring piece of s*** in the world

1500
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:24,704
Cory could be like an intentional decision of like

1501
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,264
I need to try and get pressed

1502
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
What can I

1503
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
Do all rant about eating

1504
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
People

1505
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:35,200
And on that level that is the case if it was like some sort of a decision

1506
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,784
I'm super glad that I haven't seen a lot of people

1507
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,624
Talking about it outside of our show I don't think I've heard

1508
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:49,280
Hide nor hair from any media Outlets about how Alex entire sect

1509
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,328
Take me to bat eating his neighbors

1510
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,936
But I think that's great he does stuff like that

1511
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,800
Do things that benefits him is the Free Press he gets out of it

1512
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,616
And like we can talk about it and laugh

1513
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,944
Yeah it is in a way that is not helpful to him

1514
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,480
And

1515
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:14,880
I am gone glad I'm glad I'm glad to see I'm glad to see people not taking that troll bait

1516
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:20,000
It does very much seem like everybody else but us has just moved on from

1517
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,536
Completely we've got

1518
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,352
We've got Ben Shapiro in those dumb motherfukers

1519
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,120
To deal with

1520
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,144
Alex's

1521
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,752
To enjoy

1522
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
Perhaps

1523
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:37,152
At the same time I do like that we're getting the Free Press out of his lunacy now instead of him

1524
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,016
If there is a C+

1525
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:47,136
Continue

1526
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,208
Just do this and whoever wants to listen to it a listen to it

1527
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:56,864
I look forward to being a footnote and I look forward to somebody being like and then one time there was those guys

1528
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,912
That would be good

1529
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:04,032
Radio broadcasters of like a thousand years from now

1530
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,312
They'll be talking about

1531
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,688
3300 years ago in Greece that started a plutocracy

1532
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Send

1533
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
1500 years ago

1534
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
The bubonic plague

1535
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,112
Something something zuberg crash

1536
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,416
In 2020

1537
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:26,048
These guys talked about Alex Jones for no reason

1538
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:32,448
I would love to be the center of these two guys were the true masters of the world face I would enjoy that

1539
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:38,848
I want to be high really don't I don't think I could handle that kind of like a negative attention

1540
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,384
Oh yeah

1541
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,456
I can't hear but I can't cuz I'll be back

1542
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:49,600
So Alex talks about one of the things that's really difficult is like

1543
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,208
In order to really discuss everything that I would says

1544
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
Like in a clip like this you have to be like okay well let's break down all of the inaccuracies that you believe about

1545
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Bill Gates wanting

1546
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,424
Depopulate the world and all that

1547
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,960
And I choose to

1548
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:08,032
Ignore that cuz we've talked about it in the past

1549
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:14,432
Image clip Alex just says that he wants Bill Gates to stab himself in the Ion Television

1550
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,160
Really you like star will kids to death and what was too many

1551
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,440
Can you dye fur

1552
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,024
It's up on TV and he takes up

1553
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,400
I'll say well I got respect to that guy

1554
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,704
YouTube

1555
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,496
My point is

1556
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
You want us to die

1557
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
What you don't

1558
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,432
Little pink shirt you look on flip diving

1559
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,480
Either one

1560
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,296
Zuckerberg

1561
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
You're not

1562
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:04,608
A pink shirt

1563
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:11,264
Show that picture of your ass forgot bag

1564
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
I think there's just a hostility on Alex's part of anybody who is mail

1565
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,712
Receives as feminine

1566
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:28,928
I think it bothers me so much about that is

1567
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,232
I agree with the sentiment

1568
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,304
And he is working so hard to make it

1569
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,704
The opposite you mean well I mean functionally okay the rich are not going to suffer from

1570
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,472
Seabreeze opening

1571
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,240
Sing the country

1572
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,520
Everybody who is

1573
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,544
Is going back to work

1574
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,312
Work is going to suffer

1575
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,616
So if you want to say you know like

1576
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:52,224
F*** you you want to go back to work work on the floor you billionaire a******

1577
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
I get that

1578
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,856
But then he's also saying we should reopen the economy

1579
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,160
In order for them to kill us

1580
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:03,744
The same way I want Bill Gates to sell stavis

1581
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
And I speaking

1582
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:11,168
Do you understand like although I don't think the reality I don't understand

1583
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,264
Beef stew what you think Alex's is saying I'm not person

1584
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,032
Incorrectly

1585
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,360
Cuz what I understand him to say is that

1586
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
He wants to

1587
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,736
Control the population or Bill Gates wants to control the population by killing humans

1588
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:31,136
And Alex would respect him if he said there's too many humans that help

1589
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,976
Because he's too many human right right so far so good

1590
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:38,048
So functionally what he's saying is if the rich

1591
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,864
Want to Bill Gates in the rich want to depopulate the

1592
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,144
Start with

1593
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:42,912
Bright

1594
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:49,312
So I don't see okay I see what you're saying

1595
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
Back to work yourself

1596
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,920
But I still think that there's something there in that

1597
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,712
He's doing the opposite of what he

1598
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,504
He's stating he wants to happen

1599
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,528
Fair enough

1600
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:04,928
The problem that I had is you were saying it sounded like what you were saying that you supported the idea Bill Gates dabbing or something

1601
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,144
I'm too far gone to give a s*** about what Bill Gates

1602
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
If he stabbed himself in the eye

1603
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,240
Great

1604
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:22,336
I would stop just short of that but

1605
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:28,736
But if you did it I'm not I'm not here to go to bed for Bill Gates say that everything he's done has been the past or the

1606
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,856
Is he could with the means that he has

1607
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:38,720
But I do think that the way that Alex Paints the portrait is is

1608
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,512
Deeply unfair

1609
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,048
Agreed agreed

1610
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,608
When you have people

1611
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,912
Think about population issues around the world

1612
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,448
Aren't talking about

1613
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
Cohen

1614
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,264
People they aren't talking about

1615
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
Depopulating the world they're talkin about

1616
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,896
Offering birth control options

1617
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,712
People in the developing world

1618
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,760
Ways to make

1619
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,320
The people who are alive live Better Lives

1620
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624
And the Next Generation do better

1621
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,184
The generation that is

1622
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,464
Is here now

1623
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,048
Alex is turning that into a genocide

1624
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
Mission that they're on

1625
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
And it's just not

1626
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:22,752
It's just not fair so when he says like you wanted you want everyone to kill yourself

1627
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:27,360
You're welcome your premise is wrong because your premise is wrong

1628
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,176
I mean functionally what they're saying with

1629
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,248
Providing

1630
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,528
Population quote

1631
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,552
Control is

1632
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Free women

1633
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
Yeah population

1634
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:42,208
That well.

1635
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:45,280
That's kind of where I'm at

1636
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
Because that's

1637
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:50,144
That's what it really is birth control all of those things are giving women

1638
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,680
Options for living

1639
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:54,496
In a way that is not essentially subservient

1640
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
2

1641
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,800
The guy who has Ray Smith

1642
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
Or whatever you want to call

1643
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:02,176
And that is the thing that terrifies these people

1644
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,224
It does seem that way women have

1645
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,248
Freedom of choice

1646
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,040
And just Freedom at all

1647
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
Is there fun

1648
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:14,464
Alex

1649
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,328
I think he says something and then immediately thinks

1650
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,608
It was at

1651
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,632
Like you think I asked

1652
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
Shouldn't said that

1653
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
Redline

1654
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,008
Saying crazy

1655
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,760
Right here where the middle of a very long pause

1656
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,600
Right after he says everyone's pensions are going I'm not trying to scare you

1657
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:48,000
That makes me think that there's maybe a voice in his ear that sang like what you talkin about or he's getting up

1658
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
Date of some sort

1659
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:54,912
But there's just some really long pause after he says that and then he doesn't really follow through with the thought

1660
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,616
Because I think you have bought is the fear of this virus

1661
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
So much

1662
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,712
Launch do whatever

1663
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,248
They want

1664
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,584
Duty to do Duty

1665
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
David in tabletop exercises admitted at all

1666
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:30,240
Can we buy into a go long with it we deserve it

1667
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,056
Guy though

1668
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
Stockholm Europe

1669
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:39,200
People doing all this to know that

1670
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,528
The tens of millions are starving to death it's your fault

1671
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:43,808
Bill Gates

1672
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
It's your fault

1673
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,160
Youtube CEO

1674
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,464
Is your fault Sundar pichai

1675
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
Google

1676
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,280
Your fault Democratic Party

1677
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:57,376
Along with it

1678
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,680
Lazy this delivery is

1679
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
Not about

1680
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
Fault

1681
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,968
When discussing the idea that people are

1682
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
Struggling

1683
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:19,392
Developing world not important right now if you care about the issues

1684
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,464
Right now to be like a Sundar pichai this is on you

1685
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,792
It's not my fault why would it ever be Alex's fault

1686
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,072
Why would it ever be

1687
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:31,168
The only reason he brings that stuff up is because he is singularly focused

1688
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:33,216
On finding ways to

1689
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:33,984
Not

1690
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,544
Fuel to blame

1691
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,896
That's unhealthy that's a compulsion that he has you so afraid of taking blame

1692
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:42,176
It's a fundamental

1693
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
So part of

1694
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Any kind of

1695
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:48,064
Just relationship therapy of just like if you fixate on

1696
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,112
Fault blame

1697
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,904
You're never going to be able to move forward

1698
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:59,072
Because because resolving the blame game means there's a winner and a loser rated Martin

1699
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,376
1999

1700
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,240
That doesn't solve the problem

1701
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,800
Figuring out who's to blame doesn't solve the problem

1702
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:12,128
The problem still exists even do you have like a finger to point

1703
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:18,528
I don't care I it is absolutely Bill Gates

1704
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:21,088
Republican party phone it's absolutely all these people's fault

1705
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:25,184
Who gives a s*** now right let's do something about it and until we

1706
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,584
Do something about it I don't give a s*** some things that are terrible right now maybe the fault

1707
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
People who are no longer alive

1708
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:38,240
Yeah I also believe the thought of systems that have been built over time

1709
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,264
That are

1710
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
Cancerous

1711
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,056
And

1712
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
Not good

1713
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,408
Spending all day

1714
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
Trying to like

1715
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:50,016
Parse out the ways that you're not responsible for it

1716
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:53,600
Is a way to never deal with the actual issues

1717
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,624
Invalid

1718
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,696
Wants to invest in that he wants to play that game

1719
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:02,048
I think that's right in line with his entire career and I applaud him for staying up

1720
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
Of course

1721
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:05,120
But I don't think that it gets anywhere

1722
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,168
But it's so consistent with him

1723
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,704
And it's less

1724
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
Important icing

1725
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:10,752
To him

1726
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,800
To say who is to blame

1727
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,616
It's more important to be like I am not

1728
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,176
Mmm that that also is

1729
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Is just

1730
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
I mean

1731
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,528
His conscience is so guilty

1732
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:26,112
He spends most of his time trying to convince himself that he's

1733
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,672
Like it is it is a

1734
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,744
Constant war in his brain I imagine Jeff just like

1735
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:38,656
He's got those voluntary like oh s*** I am part of the I'm part of this problem and then he has to be like

1736
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,448
No no no it's Bill Gates

1737
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,544
And my conscience is convincing himself

1738
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,688
Just talking to a mirror

1739
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,760
So in the sex club Alex talks about how like

1740
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,832
He might have been wrong about this whole coronavirus thing

1741
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,112
Maybe Trump was right all

1742
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Call Mom

1743
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
You know I was the guy

1744
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,952
Play sigala twin hay

1745
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:05,280
This is a big thing in China they're going to use this to shut things down

1746
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,584
Democrats shut things down

1747
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:13,216
Going along with some other he's got at least say he's worried

1748
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,944
Emanuel Rahm

1749
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,344
President Trump's wife

1750
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
That sucks

1751
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:43,424
Show me a hero.

1752
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
BC the trap now

1753
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,496
Never end

1754
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,800
News

1755
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,848
Are you go get sun

1756
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
Awesome die

1757
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
David

1758
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,344
Beasley

1759
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,416
The world health food program

1760
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,000
He's up there

1761
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:11,328
They're collecting money for the UN do never deliver

1762
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,376
QPR stubs with a

1763
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,424
Jolie

1764
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,520
Oh here the laughing

1765
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,056
Is your bag of rice.

1766
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,336
Baby

1767
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:26,688
When they engineered the whole thing and admit they want depopulation

1768
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,272
Did they say that person is subhuman

1769
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:36,672
So this is the kind of mindset that allows Alex to pretend that he cares about people and also support people like

1770
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,976
Call Juan eliminate all foreign aid

1771
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:42,048
He's just convinced himself that the UN doesn't do all these

1772
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
These things that he doesn't see

1773
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,912
And therefore it's not happening

1774
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:52,288
It's very solipsistic and it's very it's very much like a I only see the pr thing

1775
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,104
And therefore those are the only things that are going on

1776
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:59,200
And to think that I want to stress really strongly is that this is

1777
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,224
A representation

1778
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
The privilege

1779
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
And what

1780
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,064
The Privileges is

1781
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:08,672
You know things are bad in the world in a lot of ways and there's things that we

1782
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:12,512
Should do more for those things that we need to do better about

1783
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,560
We are so incredibly privileged

1784
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,864
That there is an International Community

1785
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,888
Does

1786
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,656
Help you

1787
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
Yes we are privileged

1788
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
With not

1789
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,752
Seeing

1790
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,288
The kind of death

1791
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,848
That we would see if those

1792
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:28,640
Aide program

1793
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
And

1794
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,968
Alex

1795
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,320
I don't know how else to say this then

1796
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,624
Pray that he never gets

1797
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,416
To learn exactly how wrong you

1798
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:44,000
Because it would come along with so much

1799
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,048
Horror for people like

1800
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:48,096
If he ever got his way

1801
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:54,496
That he imagines the all this Aid money goes away all of these programs dry up

1802
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:58,336
Because all they do is PR stunts and siphon off money and all this

1803
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,152
I pray that he never gets

1804
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,688
What he desires

1805
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,224
Because if he does

1806
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,320
The amount of human suffering that would be exposed

1807
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,088
Is

1808
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,160
It's almost unthinkable

1809
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:12,928
No I mean

1810
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
Look at

1811
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:16,512
He's getting a taste of what it is he wants right now and

1812
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:22,912
Also I find it so funny for him to start it for him to say he's not a Stockholm Syndrome guy

1813
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
And then

1814
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,496
F****** he's been abused by Trump

1815
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:29,056
Over and over and over

1816
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,592
And he's literally like

1817
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,128
I love him for the

1818
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,408
I've ever look

1819
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,176
I'm wrong

1820
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,968
I'm wrong and he's right

1821
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Sure

1822
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:43,136
He's made me give up literally every position that I've ever hold accelerating the vaccine program

1823
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:48,256
I'll let him do anything he wants

1824
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:53,888
That's probably the smartest dude on Earth for sure

1825
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:02,080
In this next I'm going to give a little bit of a Content warning ahead of time therealak

1826
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:08,480
Text talks about he's encouraging people to kill themselves in this next clip with your senses

1827
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,248
For those artists

1828
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:15,648
Please be aware that this might be pressed the 30 seconds every 45

1829
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,416
Press it twice

1830
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,696
Yeah he's he's

1831
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,768
This is a really disgusting thing that he's presenting

1832
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,304
Hope you enjoy yourself

1833
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,656
Because you're going to get a big old heaping helping

1834
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:35,360
It should be terrible people

1835
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
You going to die

1836
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,488
20 people

1837
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,280
Slit your wrist today

1838
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:55,072
Take those pills today

1839
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,120
Get out of the way now

1840
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,824
How about you get up there first

1841
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,616
So much wealth

1842
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,432
Show us how it's done

1843
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:12,224
The big man dies

1844
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,344
What's Bill Gates

1845
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,928
Big man doesn't

1846
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
It is dark

1847
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,104
No is misspeaking

1848
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:43,200
Not know what to do about something like this

1849
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,320
Eternal death and eternal corruption

1850
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,392
US army war with China

1851
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,976
You forgave you want to turn loose on it

1852
01:50:55,232 --> 01:51:01,376
Jesus I mean like that's that's so f***** up and so inappropriate

1853
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:03,168
Darkship

1854
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,192
We're so

1855
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:10,592
Browbeaten by Alex's in Sandy

1856
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:13,664
What is a clip even is a little bit

1857
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,944
Past look like

1858
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,480
Normally use is

1859
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,248
Cool

1860
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,576
Like being like hey all you go

1861
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,672
Deeply f*****-up

1862
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:29,280
Even for us it's a little bit hooked up but then you consider like

1863
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,096
This is a show he's doing

1864
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:37,472
Imagine anyone else saying stuff like that Wolf Blitzer used to say it on CNN all the time though

1865
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:42,080
You know you miss that situation yourself

1866
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:44,896
This situation is

1867
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
Done

1868
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:52,832
I remember the time

1869
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:53,856
Oh man

1870
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:56,416
Here's your brother moment

1871
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:04,096
I mean we hear stuff like that it's like really brings into sharp Focus like

1872
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:07,680
How little control there is over the show

1873
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,472
And like that doesn't even come up

1874
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,520
As strongly my mind is

1875
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,800
Money says things like

1876
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,384
That's worse than that

1877
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,408
No this is

1878
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
This is too dark

1879
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,040
Yeah it's too dark for him to be on are his mood is too dark

1880
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:25,088
His situation is too dark

1881
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,368
He is only

1882
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,904
It's one thing cuz it's

1883
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,744
Kind of funny when he's yelling about eating it's kind of fun

1884
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:35,840
That's a funny expression of the darkness or whatever

1885
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
That like

1886
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:37,888
Alright

1887
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:41,216
This can't go on wow it's happening

1888
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,032
Let's Ride the Lightning

1889
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,824
When he's saying like

1890
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,152
Kill yourself and it and things like that along those lines

1891
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:53,504
He's talking about Bill Gates it's so abstract and he's a

1892
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,808
Public figure and then all this like

1893
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:59,136
Then becomes murky and turns like that's f***** up but it's

1894
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,928
Kind of in line with what Alex does

1895
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:04,000
We talked about like all you left people kill yourselves

1896
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,560
You think there's too many people that

1897
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,120
Hit some

1898
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,912
I don't know I feel like

1899
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,728
I feel like it has a real potential to harm

1900
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,288
And I I don't I don't like it

1901
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,080
Yeah I mean

1902
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
There's

1903
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:26,016
When was the last time you saw anything on TV or anywhere that mentioned suicide and didn't immediately have the two

1904
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
Suicide hotline

1905
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,600
You know like this is irresponsible

1906
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:32,160
That is

1907
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
About life

1908
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,976
No I know that's that's another issue

1909
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:40,352
Nihilists Ellipsis narcissist on the air is

1910
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:44,960
It's bad for me people who really care about mental health issues

1911
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:45,728
Wood

1912
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,776
Care about

1913
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:51,104
Someone whose politics were different than them who would struggle

1914
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:51,872
Absolute

1915
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896
You know

1916
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:54,176
Alex.

1917
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:54,944
No

1918
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,248
I mean the think of other like

1919
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:59,040
The deaths of despair

1920
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:05,440
Well that's another thing I mean that is so many overdoses

1921
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,720
Suicide by

1922
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,536
Bygone like an ounce

1923
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,840
Yeah and that is s*** that is like

1924
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:16,704
How can you even treat that as I don't care what

1925
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,240
Political side you're on

1926
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:21,312
How can you treat that as anything other than as a human

1927
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:22,336
Health crisis

1928
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:29,248
Because he wants more people to have done well he talks about the deaths of Despair as being like

1929
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:32,832
Like a laxative the manifestation of a war on white men

1930
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:38,976
He talks about that cuz looking like opioid crisis as soon as it's all and all that stuff

1931
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:44,864
But when he talks about things like this is like you think there's too many people kill yourself kill yourself now

1932
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:47,680
I did become something where you you can't

1933
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:54,080
See things like that if you care about the underlying issue of the thing you're trying to use

1934
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,640
Like if you care about the death of

1935
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,456
Asparagus and that's everything you can't use

1936
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:02,784
Death by Suicide is some sort of

1937
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,576
Prop like that

1938
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,112
It's it's undercutting of

1939
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
Of the thing that he

1940
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:09,696
Chance to be no I mean like

1941
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:14,560
I've got I've got a an attempt or two under my belt in that's

1942
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,584
F****** me up

1943
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,120
Like I really don't

1944
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,400
I really don't find that

1945
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
Acceptable to be

1946
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,960
Anywhere near

1947
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:24,544
Instruments

1948
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:27,616
In this next clip we jump off that

1949
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:34,016
Goodness and about videos ever coming out of China or fake

1950
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:34,784
You're f****** didn't

1951
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,344
Talk about it all the time.

1952
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,904
And honestly this clip is just

1953
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,952
Describe this is B

1954
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:42,976
All made up

1955
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,256
Everything in this is

1956
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:48,096
True

1957
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:51,680
Videos

1958
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:58,336
Viruses man-made

1959
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,152
Seriously

1960
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,456
We now know why

1961
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,760
Hey that's your Bill Gates who

1962
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,296
Finance whole thing

1963
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
Japanese

1964
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
The vaccine

1965
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,952
Because you could never

1966
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,232
Have a vaccine

1967
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,352
Or a cold virus because there's thousands of them in the Corona Familiar every year

1968
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,192
Play new age

1969
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:28,032
What it is

1970
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:33,920
Religion

1971
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,712
Creatures of three or more

1972
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,528
Chimera

1973
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,576
Nothing you saying means anything

1974
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:46,208
Is nonsense

1975
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:50,304
More by Celine positive on the rules but chimeras

1976
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,400
So I

1977
01:56:54,656 --> 01:57:00,800
Version 2 or we saw conversion 5 what are we dealing I'd like to stipulate that I don't know the rules of chimera

1978
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,080
Definition

1979
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:02,848
It seemed

1980
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,640
Pointless

1981
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:06,688
So maybe chimeras have to be three

1982
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:10,272
Don't care

1983
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:16,672
Just wasn't as Charmed by any of this that I feel like even

1984
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,464
Now maybe some

1985
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:24,864
Baby in a different time I would have danced around

1986
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:30,752
I don't care I don't care like all of that is not true every other piece

1987
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:35,104
Of that everything that has any implication in real world

1988
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,152
Is not true all that b*******

1989
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,176
Yeah

1990
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
So Alex

1991
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,528
Little bit to distract

1992
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:48,928
This is the point where I think he played a special report to be off air for a little bit

1993
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,464
Forehand I got to go off air

1994
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,256
So he did it smooth

1995
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:55,328
But there was a special report and it comes back

1996
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:58,656
We are back live and there's a lot of craziness going on today

1997
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:06,848
Ago and it's important. So I still got them coming up

1998
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,688
I guess just come back the next time now

1999
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,224
Busy

2000
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:17,344
Over there in the corner for me punch a bag live here

2001
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:21,440
Global takeover

2002
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:27,840
I don't think that he was busy reading documents this is around the time in the show win the

2003
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:34,240
Documents were starting to be released from his case

2004
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,776
Contacting him after the hearing

2005
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:40,640
So I think that he was on the phone with his lawyers and he was getting too skinny

2006
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,688
On

2007
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
You know

2008
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:46,016
What would how's things were progressing

2009
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,320
So I just I think it is

2010
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,600
Mostly distracted

2011
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,160
Gas

2012
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:55,488
Valentine's on is a guy who's been

2013
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,536
We haven't talked about him because

2014
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,608
Has been on any of the episodes that we've covered but

2015
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:03,936
I did find a number that a couple episodes

2016
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,240
Care about this guy

2017
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,568
The ghost of David Rockefeller

2018
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,592
No

2019
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:16,480
It is not that Rothschild David Rothschild saint

2020
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,528
It's a guy named Mark

2021
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:19,296
Casio

2022
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,856
And I don't really care

2023
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:29,792
Here today and I want to get Mark passio and author and researcher talk show host from what on Earth is happening.

2024
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,144
You know he's doing around investigated

2025
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,936
Whatever Nicole Cribbs nerd

2026
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,288
Okay

2027
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,384
What intro

2028
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:48,224
He's a former satanic priest

2029
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,248
But

2030
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:51,296
Look I don't know this this interview is

2031
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,320
Is real stupid

2032
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,624
Is it goes on a while and it's

2033
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
A flame

2034
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,184
Although I do think this is really enter

2035
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,512
They get to talkin about the idea of Rights

2036
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:04,864
Sure we can talk about what you think of right is

2037
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,888
WRIC

2038
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:10,496
Ght I have a right to do X

2039
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:13,056
If he's a former satanic

2040
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:16,128
Priest he definitely knows a lot about right

2041
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,920
Yeah you think he does

2042
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,992
He has a definition of right

2043
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,784
That I think is actually

2044
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,320
Really limiting

2045
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,880
And kind of dumb

2046
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,184
Have through

2047
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:34,048
The forms of media that are embedded all around us and even through the toy

2048
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:35,328
Types of waves that we are

2049
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,352
Continuously

2050
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:40,448
Human thought patterns

2051
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,544
Physical control

2052
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,384
People don't know what

2053
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:53,504
Whites are ultimately

2054
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,040
Really know what a right is

2055
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,320
You can never truly

2056
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,856
If you can't Define

2057
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,488
A right is an

2058
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,512
Action that does not

2059
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,304
Cause harm to another Center

2060
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,072
Camping

2061
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:09,632
999

2062
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,168
10% of humanity cannot

2063
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
Simple definition

2064
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
Correct

2065
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:16,800
And ask people

2066
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,616
Of a human rights

2067
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:25,760
Problem and actions that do not create

2068
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:29,088
What you call Sandra violations somebody else's for you

2069
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,368
That's correct

2070
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,672
Change or become

2071
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,952
Crisis

2072
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:38,560
Only build

2073
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:45,216
I'll just accept marks definition of a cause harm to other people

2074
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,752
Sentient being

2075
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:51,616
I totally agree with that but it's not philosophical conversation about it right now

2076
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:53,408
Takis definition

2077
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,688
Let's just accept it

2078
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,968
Let's stipulate it

2079
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,248
Your rights

2080
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:00,064
Absolutely do go in a crisis

2081
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:04,416
He's presenting a definition of rights that are not Absolute Air Conditioning

2082
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:10,048
And can be impeded as soon as the Human Action in question does end up harming another person

2083
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,120
He's advancing an idea of Rights that's very weak

2084
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:19,520
And I can actually use his definition to absolutely defend all of the stay-at-home orders and business closures that are happy

2085
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:24,896
Country right now

2086
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,968
That could possibly harm another human being

2087
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:32,064
Is say you have the coronavirus and you don't have any symptoms

2088
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:38,464
And the let's say state is reopen for business quote on quote and so you have to go

2089
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,864
Go to work and you wind up spreading that coronavirus to other people who might die are you saying that that is

2090
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,656
Not okay

2091
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:51,008
Space on his definition of uses definition

2092
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:57,408
According to his bio Mark passio was a former satanic priest to get super into Tesla and makes videos about the occult

2093
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,432
I don't care

2094
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:02,016
But from what I can tell about him he seems like he belongs on Project Camelot

2095
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:04,832
However he's a good example of how these esoteric

2096
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:09,440
Conspiracy theorists are often just Trojan horsing right-wing s*** inform something it looks more into

2097
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:13,280
He's here talking about this spiritual definition of right

2098
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:18,144
Really all he's doing is talking about the libertarian concept of the non-aggression principle

2099
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,704
Like you see that a lot like it and it's

2100
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:23,008
I mean we've talked about in the past

2101
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:27,616
Like particularly when we talk about Stefan molyneux

2102
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,896
Is completely

2103
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:32,736
Self-contradictory and impossible to implement in your own life

2104
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:38,112
There's literally no way that you can follow that as a guiding principle

2105
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:39,648
That will get you to

2106
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,184
Any functional

2107
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,488
Way to live

2108
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,536
He's talking about this this

2109
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
Right

2110
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,120
Is something Human Action the Dozen

2111
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,144
Cause harm

2112
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,168
Two other

2113
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:52,192
Sentient being

2114
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,984
Aggression principle

2115
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,544
He's just using his weird

2116
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,408
The natural law of reality that exists

2117
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,944
Outside of

2118
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,528
And also I should be totally clear about this

2119
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:08,576
Alex should not at all

2120
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,856
Be into this guy

2121
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,136
Music for Satan

2122
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,928
Granted he's

2123
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,488
Not it's a different one

2124
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
He's also an anarchic

2125
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,792
Well there's that

2126
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
Algebra

2127
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,352
Musi

2128
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:23,168
Deeply about a note okay alright

2129
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:26,752
Alex we probably have some reservations about that seeing as

2130
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
He does like status

2131
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:31,104
Also he should learn the definition of words

2132
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,664
Because if you want to start saying sentient

2133
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,224
Then you're now talking about

2134
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,504
Every mammal

2135
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:41,856
Yeah you're a VIP maybe if you want to say sapiens there's an argument that

2136
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,904
You only have to worry about

2137
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:48,256
Certain terms of like

2138
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,536
He just wanted to say Hugh

2139
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:53,888
You don't sound smart

2140
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,424
Honestly I think

2141
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:58,752
I don't know I didn't look into it deeply enough but I did see something

2142
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:04,384
Led me to believe that he might be a vegan

2143
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,176
Concern for animals

2144
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,992
Like Bill Gates

2145
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,528
79th pick in his eye

2146
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:12,064
I respect him if he's a vegan

2147
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,368
Apparently if that's the

2148
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:16,672
Lowest possible form of respect One Connect

2149
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,488
Any wife is very boring

2150
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,768
It's no good

2151
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:28,448
About clip we have here

2152
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,496
And they talk about

2153
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:34,592
The idea that Bill Gates went on TV and said

2154
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,896
That there will be 700,000

2155
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,688
Vaccine

2156
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,224
He only did that

2157
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,016
Because he has to

2158
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:44,320
And you always try to

2159
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:47,392
Play into the emotional mind control

2160
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
People

2161
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,232
We're looking out for your best

2162
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,048
Further from the truth

2163
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,352
That's because they have to manipulate

2164
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
People who

2165
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,424
Want to do the right thing

2166
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,896
Especially the order followers

2167
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,432
You're taking on their car

2168
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,968
That's how they're going to escape

2169
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,248
Karmic concert

2170
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,016
Quince

2171
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:18,368
The laws of creation to spiritual laws of morality

2172
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,184
The high-level manipulators

2173
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
They're not

2174
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,768
The karmic

2175
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,096
What

2176
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,632
Appointment

2177
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,592
Corsica

2178
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,456
They understand how

2179
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,248
Really true

2180
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,528
Those laws

2181
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,832
Vendome they can manipulate people

2182
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:49,600
Into

2183
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,368
Breaking

2184
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:56,768
So that's why Bill Gates has to say these things

2185
02:06:57,024 --> 02:07:02,400
And then he kills you with his vaccine but he doesn't have the karmic debt that comes a lot

2186
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:07,776
It is that what's behind Alex's hold they have to tell you things that yes

2187
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:08,544
Wow

2188
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,128
I guess I am eating a load of nonsense is that what does that mean like

2189
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:12,896
No

2190
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:13,664
No

2191
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,712
Military leader has to accept

2192
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:20,064
The karmic debt for choosing to fight some battle or something

2193
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:24,160
Like fuk off I mean I'm sure you'd be able to figure out the way to

2194
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:28,000
The rewrite that story in a way that's convenient for you and not said

2195
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:30,560
Can I tell you this

2196
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:35,680
My clip here is titled this is nonsense

2197
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:42,336
I'm glad that it drove home point we already Annika

2198
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:45,664
But there are times when we come together in perfect

2199
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,992
So I mean we come to the end of this

2200
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,016
I'll be honest

2201
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:53,344
I'm a little because

2202
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:57,184
The thread of cannibalism did not continue I know

2203
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
But it it was destiny

2204
02:07:58,976 --> 02:07:59,488
Not too

2205
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:02,048
And I do think it was a publicity

2206
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:02,816
Silly stunts

2207
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,608
I still loved it

2208
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:09,984
It's a lot more of it

2209
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:15,872
Desperate sad yelling about eating his neighbors when everyone dresses like

2210
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:22,784
Except us and we enjoy it I do I want him to find ways to escalated and yet not

2211
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,344
Not receive the satisfaction that he wants yet

2212
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,880
Because when he does this

2213
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:29,696
I don't receive the satisfaction

2214
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:33,536
Yeah yeah it's really

2215
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:34,560
Boring

2216
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:37,632
These last couple episodes

2217
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,656
Kind of boring

2218
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,936
Endurance

2219
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,984
Flickers of things that are like

2220
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:48,384
Alright I decided to get into the 223 Hundred Year history of their stuff like

2221
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:53,760
Alright alright Alex Mendoza

2222
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:56,832
I'm disappointed

2223
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:05,024
I think there is a situation I've been wrestling with this lately a little bit in the present

2224
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,560
Consistently

2225
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:07,840
Covering it all

2226
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:08,864
And I

2227
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,656
Think that it's our responsibility

2228
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,680
And it kind of sucks

2229
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:15,776
Cuz sometimes he does shows like these are just not good

2230
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:20,384
And unfortunately that ends up with the situation where we're covering an episode that's like

2231
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:22,944
What you going to do

2232
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:24,992
Yeah but

2233
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,784
I do. Also think

2234
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:31,392
That we're in a stretch right now where it would be irresponsible for us

2235
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:35,232
Not to cover the present-day fairly blanketly

2236
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,768
If only because

2237
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:42,400
What if we don't listen what episode and he talks about cannibalism

2238
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:45,472
I know it is this episode.

2239
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:48,800
Immediately following the cannibal episode is

2240
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,824
Exactly like

2241
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:53,664
Whatever he promises next week I'm going to remove that

2242
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,736
Computer kept yeah we knew it was going to be a disappointment

2243
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,040
And yet you still hope every single

2244
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,088
Exactly like the experience of

2245
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,624
My life listening

2246
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,160
If you get hyped

2247
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,440
29 you get disappointed

2248
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:08,768
But also if you ever have you read that book The Gift

2249
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:15,680
Ping to Creation like when you create a thing cuz you recommended

2250
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:22,080
You know you got to give back to the universe in order for things to come back like you will live

2251
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:28,480
Whether or not that's actually true or not there is a function of like being creative it sometimes

2252
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:31,552
Yeah take it on the chin

2253
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:37,952
Does not work 10 hours

2254
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:41,024
We're like trying to figure out a joke you do it

2255
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,328
And then you do it again

2256
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:49,728
And you Bob you do it again and you Bob when you finally realize hours Mount I got a I got a bail on this joke

2257
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:53,824
Maybe I'll revisit it in a couple years that process of

2258
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:00,224
Writing a bad joke and wasting all that time is part of the process that eventually leads to you writing a good job

2259
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,296
Exactly and unfortunately I think these two episodes

2260
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:05,088
An hour to show our

2261
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
The

2262
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,648
Bones we must throw back in

2263
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,416
Into the ocean

2264
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,952
They gave us the good need

2265
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:16,352
I'm getting a little bit

2266
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:19,168
It's mostly because I just wanted to say

2267
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:23,008
Just want more of that

2268
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:26,592
So Alex if you're listening please talk more people

2269
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:31,712
Stop you should I make that your goal is not

2270
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,248
Fear with your observations

2271
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:36,064
And if I'd actually thought he was listening I wouldn't

2272
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,368
Probably but I am

2273
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:42,208
Board he cannot listen to a 2-hour episode

2274
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:44,256
We said we were going to eat

2275
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:46,816
I Willy

2276
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:50,144
I apologize that I vote

2277
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:56,032
Broken down at this point into a I'm bored with Alex moment but I know that maybe

2278
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,080
Friday's episode will be

2279
02:11:58,592 --> 02:11:59,104
Bike

2280
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:04,736
Right back on the horse Hope Springs yeah this is like the Prodigal Son

2281
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,784
You're coming back to Alex Jones
