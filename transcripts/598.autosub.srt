1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important items swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for snowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,816
The author of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan Jordan

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
My break is at long last

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
I have finally been able to check off

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
Seeing the Mighty Mighty Bosstones on my Maybach

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Bucket list

11
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
I was

12
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
12 I think

13
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
When

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,832
The impression that I get came out on the radio and like

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
I just like I love these horns

16
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
It was so exciting and then

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,512
My brother's a little bit older than me more tuned into

18
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
The music album

19
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,608
He played for me another Drinking Song

20
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
I like that song it's so great you just blew my mind

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
I remember hearing that they were on a radio show

22
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
The interview that ended up turning out to be loved line

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,920
And I remembered I stayed up like with a radio listening in my bed

24
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,016
Like it listening in to hear the Bosstones on on Loveline

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
I love

26
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
When I went back and I found all there

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
Another world records

28
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,976
It was just great I mean I didn't know that the Lifelong Love of Loveline

29
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
How Ya Wanna Talk About It

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,448
Before we started recording and it was not.

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
The setlist I would have chose

32
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
And it was a little bit underwhelming

33
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
A little depressed and want to talk made me think that they might be vaccine Skeptics

34
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,064
Like I don't know anything about the boss Downs politics this is a good I haven't listened to any of their albums

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
Jackknife to a swan

36
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,024
But seeing them do Someday I Suppose life was really do

37
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Great

38
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Yeah

39
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
It felt like it it

40
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,960
A momentary been a long time coming in my life like that song really meant a lot to me when I was younger

41
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
And

42
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
They still sound sharp away from them

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,456
A someone who is Dicky Barrett to voice that growling like the fact that he is as old as he is now and

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Can still sound pretty good

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Is not

46
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
That's that's impress

47
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
It is fantastic

48
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,160
Is it is like a you know the dates

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:13,280
It's a little bit like how baseball players are tennis players you know their Prime used to be

50
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
2324

51
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:20,192
And now you can hit all the way up till 3031 you know like Rafa and Djokovic all those guys there

52
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
30

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
The same is true I feel like for like

54
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
Like the rolly rolly voices

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
Technology now

56
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,712
Honey and P Technologies

57
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
There are three

58
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Vicks VapoRub

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
I felt really weird to about the idea of going

60
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
To write

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Obsessed because it's a large Gathering of people but

62
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
I talked it over with some people that I trusted their opinions on and

63
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
You have to present a vaccination

64
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Card to get in

65
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
There's a lot of space to

66
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Train

67
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,592
The pit the skank Circle

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
And do you know math

69
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
People are still wearing masks

70
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
It felt like a responsible risk

71
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
As far as it went.

72
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
There's still a part of my brain that couldn't get past that

73
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
You know they couldn't get past like

74
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,696
This long. Of time readjusting to like

75
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
What is okay

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
You know the thing that

77
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
Open for me was whenever cuz Lollapalooza this year

78
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
I was like looking at that going horrify

79
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
War Fox

80
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
This is going to be a nightmare

81
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
Yeah and then only like

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,663
Tiny tiny percentage actually like it was not a super spreader as hell

83
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
It's almost like they is there's the people you came with

84
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,087
If you if it was that number of people you know I remember I don't remember the exact

85
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,695
Districts on if it was the numbers were

86
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
Shockingly low interact

87
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
Any cases that were traceable to

88
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,631
Yeah and I think that did make me feel a little bit more comfortable they like

89
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,447
If you're doing these things if you can do them response

90
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Sibley and especially if it's like

91
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
You know Mexican carjacking

92
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Where are you I don't know if

93
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
Maybe maybe we're at a point where

94
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Some some

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
By reasonable risk

96
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Can be accepted

97
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,367
It is

98
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,439
Sure sir Cortana Cassie I got to make sure

99
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
But it was

100
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
It's not worth it

101
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
No that is it is

102
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
It is also a little bit that

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Kind of

104
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,007
We've talked about it for months now but that two different America's you know the vaccinated and unvaccinated

105
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
You can go to a f******

106
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Festival

107
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
You know

108
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,199
Like but then you go to non-vaccinated part of America and you can't f*** around

109
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
It everywhere

110
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Bananas yeah

111
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
It is bananas

112
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
It is so what's your bright spot today Dan is as you well know I live a very

113
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,071
Unhealthy lifestyle from me

114
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,191
Pretty ecstatic well last night my partner and I

115
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,519
We've signed up for some like healthy

116
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
I think

117
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
They send you meals

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
Don't give him a shout out

119
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
But it's not one of the ones that ever ties done podcast again okay I'm so last night I ate my first

120
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
Beyond meat so it's like a it's like a meat replacement the whole thing

121
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
That's interesting

122
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,423
I tried it and everybody says it's like regular milk can f*** off

123
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
It's not

124
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
However

125
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
It is not

126
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Not unlike

127
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Regular meat

128
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Know what I mean

129
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
Yeah that's kind of the the sense that I've got for vlogging

130
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
People

131
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Yeah their similarities to me

132
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
It's not exactly the same but

133
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,807
But it's like a drastic improvement over what was there was there

134
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
Totally

135
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Still no progress

136
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Is being made we ate a Burger it was

137
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
Was like good yesterday

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
All vegetables

139
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
That was my first all-vegetable day

140
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Ever Maybe

141
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Buy on purpose

142
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
He's going to be gay

143
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
Coronavirus boots it's not going to last very long but I

144
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
Did it well I'm proud of myself

145
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Applaud

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm sure I think that

147
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
What's the best contacts for those

148
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Meal delivery things

149
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
Elizabeth within a couple

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
Yeah cuz I tried it once

151
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Stan

152
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
I was out in Alabama

153
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Why would I do that

154
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Yeah

155
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
It was depressing

156
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
To see the two meals

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Just sitting there

158
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
This'll take a little bit of preparation tonight like I can just pull it out of the fridge and top

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,871
You know what it what's amazing about it and the thing that is the only big thing for me

160
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Because f*** being healthier with

161
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Begin the nonsense or whatever

162
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
I mean I do feel it I feel it took

163
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
One day of eating vegetable I feel way better

164
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Portion

165
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Control like last night

166
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
I8

167
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
What made me full

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
And then I was

169
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
Done I didn't have like another entire meal of Chinese food said like continue jamming in

170
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959

Alex says

185
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,759
Shockingly awful and also there's a topic that comes up that I would like to talk about

186
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039

00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671

I'm a policy wonk podcast around children

196
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,703
Yeah if you are pregnant or

197
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,287
With with a child do not listen to this podcast

198
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,383
You know how they say

199
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
What does Bacchus is the opposite

200
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
No

201
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
And even if even if your child becomes

202
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Successful

203
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
An Avenue like this and you don't want

204
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
You don't want that let me tell you this child

205
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,815
Pipefitters jobs

206
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,887
So we start here Jordan on September 7th

207
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
And Alex has a big news story not so concerned with covid for most of this episode although it is apparently bio

208
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I'm going to kill everybody

209
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
There's bigger news and that is

210
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
They're Haisha

211
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Chen's in America

212
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
Well now in one Bridge

213
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
In Del Rio Texas

214
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
2030 major bridges are more

215
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
There have been over 10,000 Asians

216
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
Just yesterday now it's over 15,000

217
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
And a band any drones with

218
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
The technocracy with the geofence they put up

219
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
Free program

220
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
We were there with our drones

221
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
They suddenly wouldn't take off the Fox News drones with dick off

222
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
We put up a geo-fence in order to Biden you can't

223
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Why these

224
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Mexico side

225
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
Got one up and then we were able

226
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Nobody else has

227
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Last night as the sun was setting

228
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Thousands more

229
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
Surging across

230
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
The border and walking over to dangerous spillway

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
In the Rio Grande men women and children

232
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
Because Biden a days ago said any actions that get here

233
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
We're in an object already not coming testim

234
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
And bring them into the United States to sign up for welfare

235
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
I use with a permanent underclass

236
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
It sounds like

237
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Or

238
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
We were accepting refugees from nightmarish

239
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
Escape that climate change itself has caused as well as

240
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Roar in turmoil over the weird fascination of their president by some random ass doctor in Florida

241
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,983
What will get to this on the 2nd but like I want it I want to just put the like

242
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Right up front

243
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,639
Like I'm not entirely sure what was going on with the no-fly area over this

244
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
This bridge

245
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,551
Sure I presume that there may be a safety reason why that was.

246
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
In terms of like not allowing Fox news's

247
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Drones

248
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,415
The flyover

249
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
I don't know but I do think that's a legitimate

250
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
That is the only thing that I think is legitimate Within

251
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
Any of this coverage is it appropriate

252
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
To save media companies cannot fly a drone

253
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Over

254
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
This area

255
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
I'm not sure

256
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
I mean

257
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
Here's my only rebuttal to that

258
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
That is

259
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
At the end of the day if Fox News and Infowars

260
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
They're trying to put drones over a bridge where refugees are coming

261
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:45,183
They stopped being media organizations and start turning into propagandist trying to get people kill I agree

262
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
So at that point I was like the moment he said they wouldn't allow drones to take off I was like oh yeah that's what I would have

263
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
I was going to get propaganda

264
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
I don't

265
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Don't know at what point

266
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
You were able to

267
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
You say

268
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
That rule is

269
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
You can't do this because you're going to do bad things with the pics

270
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
After the migrant Caravan

271
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
I mean we should have learned our lesson there

272
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
See but

273
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Turning all the drugs off

274
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,135
Maybe Jeff so this story if you just hear from Alex is that Joe Biden is begging Haitian

275
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Succumb to the United States where they'll be

276
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Accept it in with no process at all

277
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,327
Put on welfare and used as a political weapon against people like Alex breed white people

278
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,727
It's essentially 100% does the newest articulation of the great replacement narrative and it's a little more than white nationalism

279
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Pretending to be a policy

280
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Concern

281
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
So here's the real story

282
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
There's approximately 12,000 and maybe a little more now but they're asylum-seekers mostly from Haiti who made camp

283
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Under the Del Rio International Bridge

284
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,063
While they wait processing by customs

285
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Border Protection

286
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
This is technically within the United States

287
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
And it's important

288
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,231
It is because you can't request

289
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Asylum anywhere except for inside the United States

290
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
They do that if you want to request Asylum

291
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
I plead your case

292
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Within like

293
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
You have to be

294
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
BND

295
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Across the border

296
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Pretending that that's not the case is

297
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
The two of the right-wing media

298
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Rivalry

299
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,271
This isn't a situation where this is an invasion Point nor is it a situation that you can extrapolate

300
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Every bridge

301
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
On the texas-mexico Border

302
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
It's a specific set of circumstances that exist for a reason

303
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
And it's a humanitarian in logistics

304
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Call challenge

305
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Not a crisis that requires were treating to white supremacist

306
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Conspiracy theories

307
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
This is kind of the state of things for Alex's information

308
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Space though

309
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,495
Much like there will never be election coverage anymore that isn't rooted

310
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:39,359
Assumption that the Democrats are cheating in the GOP you're secretly always the rifle winners

311
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,479
There's never going to be any coverage of any immigration and Refugee related stories on Alex's show

312
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,319
It isn't firmly entrenched in the belief that non-white people coming to the United States

313
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
Is an attack on white people in the United

314
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Explicitly

315
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,791
What are the large contributing factors to the specific circumstances were seeing now

316
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,863
Is that there was a large influx of people from Haiti seeking Asylum

317
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Four Seasons

318
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Like you touched on

319
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,031
The president was assassinated in July and then there's a huge earthquake in mid August

320
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
The destroyed over 120,000 home

321
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Earlier in the year immigrant rights groups have noted that Biden's administration at actually been using title 42 explosions to do

322
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Deport immigrants back to

323
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
I hate more than Trump even did

324
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Yeah

325
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
Title 42 for the US go that says the president

326
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
You can limit the ability of migrants to come to the United

327
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
If they come from countries where communal

328
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Double diseases are present to a level

329
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
There's a pretend

330
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Apple health risk

331
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
Trumpy focus on the context of covid to limit the ability of migraine

332
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Prince to come to United States

333
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
And unlike how you might have hoped

334
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
It would go Biden has continued with

335
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
This policy

336
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
And many folks on the left have been

337
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Intensely critical of him for this

338
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,527
Rightfully so yeah I do like how people are like nobody on the left criticizes Joe Biden

339
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
There are

340
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,719
On August 3rd the Department of Homeland Security temporarily placed people arriving from Haiti on the list of migrants are qualified for

341
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Temporary protected status

342
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Set to be in effect from August

343
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Easter 2021

344
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Do temporary 3rd 2023

345
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Possible for individuals from Haiti who were in the country to apply for TPO

346
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
Yes status which would make them not able to be summarily deported

347
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Before they could apply for Asylum

348
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Side note

349
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
If you ever wondered why there

350
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Particular countries that end up

351
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Become a hot-button

352
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
Topics for right-wing media you know like in terms of immigration

353
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
Because these countries are on the temporary protective

354
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,559
Somalia sedan Syria Venezuela all on the way

355
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,215
Highway 80 was on the TPS list and US deportation should have been halted but it turns out that last week

356
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Immigration and Customs

357
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,335
Enforcement on Wednesday expelled 86 Haitian Nationals from the unite

358
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Red States

359
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
And flew them back to Haiti

360
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,247
Two fairly shocking given the priority PS announcement and migrant rights groups

361
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
As well as Democratic house members like

362
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
Ayanna Pressley had sharp criticism

363
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
There's alot going on here

364
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
The ministration appears to be really dropping

365
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Turn the ball in terms of this issue

366
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,119
In response to the news of the situation at the Del Rio bridge at ice announced that they were planning to ramp up deportation

367
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
With a deportation

368
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Complaints with him

369
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
Next week antenna week after that which is

370
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,263
There seems to be

371
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Incongruent message incoming

372
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
From different parts of the government

373
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
To a knot

374
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
But small extent

375
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Going back to the Obama Administration

376
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Ice has often seemed like they have

377
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Become just a complete row gauge

378
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
I don't know how to look

379
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,023
Get some of the information that you're able to find a belated the stories about this

380
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Seem like

381
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
Wait why why are you doing that is exactly again

382
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
The the stated

383
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
Department of Homeland Security

384
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
Do you know it is it is

385
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
A little bit like that

386
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
So

387
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
So all too often

388
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
Part of the reason that

389
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
You know that the

390
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
The Chicago PD is

391
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Is it complete Rogue agency

392
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
Is because

393
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
Anytime they disagree with the mayor or whatever

394
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
All of a sudden the mayor agrees with them

395
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
And it's

396
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
Partly because if you really allowed that

397
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
To go

398
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
And like fatback

399
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Back against them

400
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
People would find out

401
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
They have just as much power if not more than the mayor

402
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
And you don't want to look like you're not as powerful as your own

403
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
So I imagine Biden doesn't want to look like he literally cannot

404
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Control ice

405
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
That maybe there might be something to that I was very

406
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Confuse the looking into

407
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
The details of the story

408
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Cuz I mean

409
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
My paygrade I don't understand

410
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
I mean you know

411
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,815
I guess a lot of people in every government have always been like we've got a certain amount that we can do right

412
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
And f****** with Isis going to be a lot more than we can do today

413
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Maybe you know

414
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
So we've lived through a number of

415
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
Scares

416
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
On Alex's part about immigration

417
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm sure all of them look kind of embarrassing and

418
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
C-130

419
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Employees down

420
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
The Border 22

421
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
To take care of

422
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
One of them

423
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,719
Music I think it is getting married and I like another one couldn't go for another reason which is

424
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Really private

425
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
No

426
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
Capture footage

427
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607

00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Haitian Caravan slamming over

429
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
The Texas border last night and our crew is there now

430
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
With no sleep

431
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
Amazing job

432
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
Is there doing an amazing job on the ground

433
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
Getting even more insane footage as we speak

434
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
What is his ongoing one of our camera guys getting married this weekend

435
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,999
Another added on podcast Yeti last night that's fine I understand

436
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
Amazing job we need more crew we need to expand but

437
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
That's really up to you and your support.

438
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Appreciate you all.

439
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,799

Do you want to plug your employees podcast AJ AJ

443
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
How to do my own podcast

444
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Anywhere from between 100 to 200 listeners who will get very unhappy if I do get it out tomorrow

445
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,303
Sorry I can't help you save the Border I got to record my podcast

446
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Yeah that tells you

447
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,727
Just how important a big deal this is yet

448
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
I feel like this

449
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,847
This is an inability on Alex's party

450
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
To convince employees

451
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
Of the seriousness of the things are there

452
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,087
Personal reason wedding braids

453
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
Schedule a wedding 2

454
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
What are the people who does end up going

455
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
Going to the Border I don't know who else is there cuz this is the only person they bring up

456
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Is Tim Enloe

457
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,007
Who's one of the guys who went with Alex the last time they went down to the Wrath

458
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Catholic charity

459
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
Rite Aid in McAllen

460
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,919
And he's also former Blackwater so that's cool

461
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,807
He believes that you know the un's trying to replace us with h

462
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Sure

463
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
There is no way

464
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
Something like this on such a massive scale

465
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,024
That's action occur in a vacuum

466
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
This is organized

467
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,448
These people all have cell phones we showed that to you

468
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
These people have the ability to recharge their cell phone

469
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,152
2 to have a cell phone to pay for the services

470
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,456
They have supplies fresh clothes

471
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Everything

472
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,064
And this is a journey that takes months for them

473
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
So this is absolutely a un sponsor soros-funded invasion

474
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Of the United States

475
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,352
And the goal is clear we know what the goal is it is absolutely

476
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,168
Replacement migration there is no doubt

477
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Jesus

478
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Pretty blunt

479
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
It is weird that a guy who more likely than not committed war crimes

480
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
In another country

481
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
That weird rated

482
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Is now like

483
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,952
I think that

484
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,048
Compelling that the evidence of humanitarian Aid existing is Bruce

485
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
There's an invasion of our country

486
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,704
I don't know I find that to be an unconvincing feeding and clothing people

487
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
And then bringing him to the United States

488
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,640
What they should be doing is invading another country and killing them

489
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
That's how it is work

490
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,200
210 sucks

491
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,760
He's very bluntly.

492
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
I was spitting

493
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,088
What is essentially watered-down white National

494
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
And it gets worse like

495
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,000
Adamantly seems to this is the first instance on this show

496
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
Of someone at Infowars saying

497
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
Dehumanizing

498
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,912
Things about people from other countries

499
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Also just dumping

500
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,544
Their children off and leaving them in the bushes and never coming back

501
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
Just like you said Bagram air base with the women throwing their babies over the walls

502
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
That's exactly right right

503
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Body sculptures

504
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,832
Children quite honestly are viewed as dispensable

505
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,136
Right they serve a purpose

506
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,464
What about purposes eventually bury tomorrow for profit

507
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,304
Or you know whatever the purpose is very from culture to culture

508
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
But what they don't have

509
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,680
Is the very close attachment

510
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
That we are the Westfield right the responsibility

511
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
To stay with that child and even die for

512
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
If necessary

513
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Wow

514
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
That's

515
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
If you can

516
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,480
Just take something that some

517
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
But he says

518
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
And then put the word

519
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Gypsy in it

520
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Go like that's what

521
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
That's it literally whatnot

522
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
He said

523
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
You don't get the flight drones over Refuge

524
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,864
That's how you're going to litigate this

525
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,728
Interesting way to do it

526
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
When

527
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,568
You are trying to Rally people

528
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
Against

529
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,408
Refugees asylum-seekers immigrant

530
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,968
Part of your argument is

531
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
They don't love their children in the same way

532
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
They don't have that attachment

533
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,648
Children in the West

534
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Do

535
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
You are

536
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
F***** up

537
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
This is this is

538
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Is not a policy

539
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
Kind of show there's no

540
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Politics in

541
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
This is straight demonization

542
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
I mean

543
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
It doesn't surprise me though

544
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
What would you

545
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,152
To fix somebody who went into another country and committed war crimes

546
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Do you know

547
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Allegedly

548
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:57,344
More likely than not there you go

549
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
I just I find it

550
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
To be concluded

551
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
Completely unacceptable

552
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
End the conversation

553
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Is about

554
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:08,096
A situation with Haitians fleeing from this gigantic earthquake in political and

555
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
Stability

556
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,240
Other issues trying to find Safety and Security of the United States

557
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
And your conversation

558
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Involved

559
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,360
They don't love their children like white people

560
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
People do

561
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
F*** yourself. How about that

562
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
You don't

563
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,528
Get a place at the table no don't get to talk you don't

564
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,296
No no

565
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
I think they don't love their children

566
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
So

567
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,976
Alex gets a little bit

568
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,584
Will you gotta talk Schwab

569
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
But it's today yeah

570
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,960
Reset all that good stuff

571
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
Sources that he wants 2.2 about you have that are a little bit sad

572
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,336
If you go

573
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,152
To Wikipedia and Klaus Schwab Zone Wikipedia

574
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Corporate fascist group that runs the UN

575
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,416
We are going to capture all the nation-states and he's been that was 6 years ago

576
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Why you were lying on Wikipedia man

577
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
You shouldn't do

578
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
Level

579
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,376
Sources in Wikipedia

580
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
Cluster of didn't say whatever he said

581
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
2

582
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Wikipedia

583
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,104
Whatever that is that may or may not be on Wikipedia

584
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
From somewhere else should I see you should say that

585
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Thing instead

586
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Do you have any kind of awareness of the

587
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,624
Like a larger that I really see why he dropped out of Community College

588
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
Play a Ted not a great source for Alex we pulling out

589
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
If you do go to it

590
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:46,144
You'll find a section about a proposal that was that was put up by the world economic Forum back in 2010

591
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,192
When Oswald was the head of the organization

592
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,312
The Proposal argue that governments were no longer the quote dominant actors on the world stage

593
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,408
Henry could be time for a new model of governance that reflected a stakeholder paradigm

594
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
This was a proposal

595
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,784
The part about capture that capturing the countries

596
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
What is a swab saying that he's going to capture the world's countries at the description of this proposal that was given by the transnational

597
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Institute

598
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
The Wikipedia page quotes

599
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
Them which is what Alex is presenting itself

600
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Schwab set

601
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,680
Also Alex would absolutely think of the transnational Institute or a bunch

602
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
The globalist

603
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
Add because they get funding from the Rockefeller Brothers fund

604
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Well that'll do it

605
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:30,432
Back for a little difficult for Alex to try and explain his worldview so dependent on Good vs Evil

606
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,504
How can be possible to this Rockefeller funded group

607
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,600
Has a sharp criticism of a policy proposal from the world economic forum

608
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
They're all evil globalist imma try to work on the same cold

609
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Makes no sense this is like you know this is a screenwriting situation this

610
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:52,704
This is a book adaptation where you come by in a couple of characters into one character in your movie

611
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
I need just kind of Move Along

612
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,520
Nonsense

613
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,544
Sure it's not a cure

614
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,200
Wikipedia Alex reporting on a

615
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Tweet

616
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,760
That's a hoax Facebook meme

617
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Strong stuff here this guy's

618
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Up all night

619
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,416
Doing this research a citation

620
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,768
Since page for this episode

621
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
It's probably just like

622
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
You know like back

623
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,400
In the day you sit on a Xerox machine Iraq your ass

624
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,984
That's a citation MLA format for your ass

625
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
More dehumanization of immigrants coming right up

626
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,456
We want to abolish all borders to solve The World's problems

627
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
We're being flooded by millions

628
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
A month basically and they say

629
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
Please consider just getting rid of your borders

630
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Edline I've got today

631
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Please

632
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Consider

633
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,144
Your borders today

634
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Completely

635
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,384
And then they cut the food off the third world tens of millions starving

636
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Military age men

637
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,928
Development

638
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
Zombies

639
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,024
Cheese

640
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,424
You know when you put in a mediately after the words that you are specifically using to describe black people

641
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
I don't care if you're black or white

642
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,568
You are one hundred percent just driving by people

643
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,176
See through the same thing as the code of the West

644
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
Actually believe any of the things he's saying any wasn't just trying to find ways to dehumanize migrants and make his audience think of them

645
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Dumbest things not people

646
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,208
He should be staunchly in favor of government subsidized food program

647
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
For all citizens

648
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,632
If you think that malnutrition turns people into zombies then he should support free lunch programs and universal access to nutrition

649
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,680
I can't imagine he'd want his fellow citizen

650
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,960
Since we turned into zombies

651
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Just because I can't afford good food

652
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
Yeah I bet he would he would super support the black panther panther brexit

653
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:13,504
This program you know I really loved it make sure that people didn't grow up to be zombies and they weren't malnourished

654
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,832
Obviously you must

655
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
Supported

656
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,136
The Black Panther Party

657
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
It seems like he would

658
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,464
Consistency dictate you should

659
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,048
Seems like it's only the story about the UN saying that everyone should get rid of bloating

660
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,376
Please please sir would you consider getting rid of your bored

661
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
That's just Alex lying and misrepresenting a story about a representative from the UN Human Rights Council suggests into the UK

662
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,408
But they should not Implement a new immigration bill into law because doing so would make

663
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Criminals of many ref

664
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Gigi's on the silence

665
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,040
Rosella Pagliacci lure said quote

666
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:52,160
I find it ironic to be honest but the very same people we felt so affected by when we saw them hanging

667
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,488
Complains in Kabul or those we are now discussing how they should be

668
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Distracted

669
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,144
If they extracted themselves and made it here they would if that bill were Lobby liable to be potential

670
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,240
To potentially four years in jail and then subject to some attempt

671
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
To return them to the other countries

672
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,664
There's something ironic in the way they were so concerned about them while they're there but we're not ready to

673
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Consider them

674
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
When they come to the UK

675
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
That's what I want to say

676
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
With this this new law that

677
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,880
Is a bill in the UK there could be

678
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Become law

679
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
The UN Human Rights

680
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,464
Cancel was advising like

681
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,488
You shouldn't do this

682
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah people who are able to flee from countries

683
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:38,240
The Koch brothers what is wrong with you people you may end up then incarcerating a

684
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Next clip suck

685
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
There's no way around it

686
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Where do you want these people that give them phones

687
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
They gave him debit cards with $1,000 on them

688
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,976
Women you want

689
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,792
Play structure

690
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Never get off welfare

691
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
This is what's going on

692
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
But to bring us down to their level

693
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,712
Wildwood flower on a private jet with 100,000 acres private ranches

694
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
My robot

695
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
Thank you almost lost track of that set

696
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,184
I'm trying to be as racist as possible and then

697
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:35,072
Robot saturno let's be racist towards them to a man that sucks

698
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
That is

699
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
That's

700
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
That's real like hey man

701
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
You're talking genocide

702
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
No more talk

703
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,128
Looking for you please also cite your sources on the 90% we know of the immigrants never get off welfare

704
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,968
Particularly considering

705
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Like what do you mean by wealth

706
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
At such a broad category of

707
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,624
Another social programs that are involved

708
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,672
What are you talkin about first

709
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
Are you talking about it like food assistance are you talking about

710
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,840
Medicaid what are you talkin about

711
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
Menu at 2

712
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Think about

713
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
Well in the United States

714
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
There are rules in place

715
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
But you can't be on

716
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Welfare programs

717
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,056
45 years after arriving

718
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
And so

719
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Okay what about that Alex

720
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,968
He's talking about Europe so look at Europe

721
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Which country

722
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,320
What are you doing

723
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
Spaghetti

724
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,976
So many differences in terms of what kind of a welfare state

725
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Exist

726
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
Between like Scandinavian countries and

727
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
And other

728
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
It's outrageous

729
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
But I don't know if this means nothing

730
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
They accepted Alex

731
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,752
Really wants agitate against

732
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Immigrants

733
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
Yeah especially considering

734
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
I mean

735
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,432
Just the sheer volume of

736
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,760
Immigrant stories that are told about America

737
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Going back

738
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
Accents

739
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Begin like

740
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,464
That's one of our favorite f****** stories is people who come here from a different country

741
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
And then

742
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
Turn into a thing here that's what we love to hear about

743
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,864
Yeah it's our lower

744
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Favorite story like how you act came into Ellis Island they changed my f****** name and I still didn't

745
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
Do anybody I'm still a good person

746
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
I'm pretty

747
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
So

748
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
I complained a little bit recently of that Damien that went around

749
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
Again owes Alex

750
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,344
Another Bon Iver song

751
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm a little bit after that there was another thing that went viral

752
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,096
I don't know sometime in the nineties bad news on Lake Public Access TV

753
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
He was young

754
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,656
When is Dad bottom

755
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
It was around then

756
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,824
He was an attractive dude talked about this before he was an attractive man when he was younger

757
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
And it's

758
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,968
It's very icy this video of him a number of times I do I don't know if it was from his

759
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Just

760
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,088
From his show or if he included it in one of his early documentaries

761
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,160
Madonna Street in Austin

762
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:13,280
Complaining about how one of the council members houses is overgrown

763
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Like the plants in the yard

764
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,096
Because someone

765
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,656
I guess probably a right-wing weirdo head gotten

766
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
The ticket for having an overgrown yard

767
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Or something you like well this city council member

768
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
It granted the steaks

769
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
A pissant

770
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,920
Go back to those steaks shirt

771
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Whatever

772
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
He doesn't seem like

773
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
The Alex Jones that you know now

774
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,600
And that's obviously because of

775
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Money

776
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:39,904
Drugs

777
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,696
Alcohol everything

778
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,304
Negative reinforcement patterns

779
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
All all sorts of things

780
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
I mean just basic

781
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
Malignant narcissism

782
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
And I

783
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
There were a few people who responded

784
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
I bet I would be super against

785
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,896
I don't think I am nearly as much

786
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Because

787
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,224
I think that that is

788
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
A ducky

789
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,040
All the time and Alex's life

790
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Sure and

791
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
Pretending that he's still the same person

792
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Yeah that would be irresponsible

793
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,768
But looking back on this and recognizing that from this

794
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Route through this

795
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
Disgusting tree

796
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Like that's not

797
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
I am 880 to be censorious with me to be like

798
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,728
Hey don't

799
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Spread that around

800
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,080
Feel like you isn't Alex hot

801
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:35,712
Yeah I'm a waste of time

802
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
I don't know it seems like

803
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
Worst

804
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,064
Waste of time where is

805
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
The Bon Iver thing

806
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
He's actually dangerous

807
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Yeah

808
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
So I didn't actually have any kind of negative response

809
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,024
People sharing that I think there is a

810
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
The difference between them is that

811
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
1

812
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
Humanizes and

813
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
What

814
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
Kind of

815
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Defang

816
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
To ascertain

817
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
Extant

818
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
Present Persona and the other one

819
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
I've almost as a

820
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Contra

821
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,528
Tears Alex in the present

822
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,160
If you go back and you watch that you look at a man who are youngboy

823
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,696
Who is handsome

824
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
And who is

825
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Not

826
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
F****** calling for genocide I'm not yelling about how the devil walks Among Us and all Democrats are demons

827
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,752
Disaster if you look at that video I'm sure part of what you see is just like

828
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
F*** what

829
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,336
Become right and I think that's what a lot of

830
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
The people who were commenting on it

831
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
Listening to a bony Vera clip and being like this is kind of fun and this is all look at him yay

832
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
Also the fact that you can see like

833
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,792
Okay this is him back in like the 90s these are the

834
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
The sort of issues that like

835
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
Really his bread-and-butter is

836
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Silly

837
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
And

838
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
It's

839
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
It ground

840
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,544
You know like it's like he's not some kind of guy

841
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,360
There is a trajectory that went from there to

842
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
Mystical Magic

843
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Cool things that happened it's just

844
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Look at what

845
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,832
Would be exactly as famous as he wasn't at clip

846
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
If you still talking about the

847
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,256
City councilors installed that's basically and started doing crazy or s***

848
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,328
And got more famous

849
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
Anyway Alex has some thoughts

850
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,912
About this video going around

851
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,008
And I immediately was like we started talking about it I thought like

852
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
I don't know if I'm going to enjoy this coverage

853
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Of it

854
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
I did because he's super defense

855
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,480
About how hot he used to be

856
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Yeah

857
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,624
There's a video that popped up last night that I have millions of views on Instagram and hundreds of thousands on Twitter people

858
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,232
They're like my God Alex Jones

859
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
I was like 20

860
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
1 years old then

861
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
I was not

862
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
Teenager as they say in the video

863
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
So that's not the bat is

864
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
That is me

865
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Play sigala

866
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
And my teeth are a little bit longer the front

867
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Grinding my teeth

868
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Coke

869
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,224
Alex Jones has

870
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,784
And quite the transformation so I see some of the

871
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Joke police out there

872
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,440
Over the years I'll actually get 180 lbs in Iran

873
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,768
6 miles every other day and let's awaits about 2 hours a day

874
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,560
I can bench press

875
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,632
Thompson and duskwatch 600

876
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
And I was quite special

877
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Quite the specimen

878
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
This is

879
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
That didn't sound that defense

880
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
It will be later

881
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,176
I'm grateful for not being that hot

882
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,224
When I was young

883
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
It's it's

884
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016
It's the fall

885
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
It's that he was too hot and now he's to hit

886
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
You know

887
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Like I'm

888
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,512
Fine I wasn't that good looking I don't get worse but it's like the fall is going to be that bad

889
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
I don't I don't really particularly care that much

890
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
What about his physical being

891
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
Critique inasmuch as like

892
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
Yes

893
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
I can see how he was

894
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,544
Conventionally attractive before and now

895
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,872
And also

896
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,152
Seems to be in poor health

897
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
Yeah I'm working

898
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Concerned about lick his ideas

899
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,832
Honestly think that the idea that being expressed in that video from his youth

900
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Although it is covering up

901
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
Some pretty

902
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,184
F*****-up believes that he just wants

903
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,512
Probably a public with at the time he was aperture

904
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,072
Had all kinds of

905
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
Anti-government ideas

906
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,376
Little

907
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
Extreme

908
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,680
Like the

909
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,728
D idea that's in that video is

910
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:46,336
Hey ticketing of overgrown Lawns should be equally enforced

911
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,872
Purifying

912
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
That's great

913
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Find

914
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
You did it

915
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Do pigs that are being expressed now are ugly

916
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
Bear bear

917
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,112
Black immigrants are people

918
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,536
It's far more important to how how ugly his insides and his ideas are to me

919
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
There any kind of like

920
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
Whether or not you're hot

921
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:11,680
Very defensive about people saying is not hot anymore

922
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Yeah there is a certain element of like

923
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:21,408
He got the wrong picture of Dorian Gray you know

924
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Picture looks

925
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Gorgeous

926
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,296
Prettier

927
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,136
I used to get like a lot of

928
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
Hate mail bacon die

929
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Recognized in college

930
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
I wrote for the paper

931
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
Like people who are like

932
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
Saying IQ the artifact

933
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,888
You piece of s***

934
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
And I would always just laugh

935
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,824
Listen to buy heads of state

936
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
Absolutely I was

937
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,687
The number one man fighting against the devil in the world

938
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,039
Intelligence service broken

939
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
The time is running out

940
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Right

941
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,927
I might not spend time on my show talking about a video of me

942
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,327
Happyville saying I used to be hot but you know might leave that alone

943
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,095
Comes up

944
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
You got to address it

945
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
Even if it is even if it interrupts

946
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,751
Yeah and you know what to think that I'm not factoring in is this sometimes you want to have

947
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
And like

948
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,311
It's not fun

949
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
To talk about

950
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
The Border

951
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
It's fun

952
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Talk about people making fun of Alex

953
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,479
I don't look like Orson Welles anymore at

954
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
I had no problems with the ladies

955
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Back

956
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Back

957
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Amazon

958
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,023
I would have some fun

959
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
The last thing I'm already kind of doing it

960
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
That makes me being a good mood

961
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
Just have some fun and show some please

962
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
People make fun of me cuz I like stuff

963
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
I don't want to talk about

964
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Caldera

965
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
What the show the live show headliner cuz I wrote it

966
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,759
That's what I do I don't just go with the rest of media saying

967
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Older 10,000-plus

968
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,879
My grandson smashed over the Border

969
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
No our cruise been there

970
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,255
Up and down the Rio Grande River for miles in all directions

971
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
NFL

972
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
Football game

973
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,703
Hey Zach I don't listen to what other people are saying I make up my own number

974
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:25,823
I estimate crazyshit on my own I don't need there

975
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
Hell-born

976
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
And

977
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
My conversation about this is going to be

978
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,759
Flagrantly offense

979
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,343
Open flagrantly offensive about that are you sure

980
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,463
So we're bringing that all these wonderful third world people

981
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:46,815
A lot of them are thugs

982
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
Bagram Air Base

983
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,983
Where the most the first flight for like 9% man

984
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
Jimmy's other cultures

985
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
It's not

986
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Women & Children First

987
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Women and children what

988
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
It's survival of the thuggish

989
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,735
And then that

990
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,527
Men breed their like that

991
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,111
And you get people that'll put your throat for nothing I don't care about you

992
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
But that's what's happening

993
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Holyshit

994
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:27,007
Congratulations Joe Rogan

995
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,335
That might be a little bit

996
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Boy

997
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
Survival of the thuggish

998
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,735
Don't know if we'll ever

999
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:37,759
Heard

1000
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
A more black

1001
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Pot

1002
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,927
Makeup a Black Kettle to call Black

1003
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
Disgusting

1004
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
I mean Lucia

1005
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
I don't really have much commentary on this outside of stuff we've said a hundred times on the show it's just discussed

1006
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Yeah I am I mean

1007
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,239
It can't cannot be said enough though

1008
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
It cannot be said enough

1009
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
That this

1010
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,615
Is the rhetoric that precedes a genocide

1011
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,151
It never

1012
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,271
Doesn't well-endowed genocide that just like f****** shows up one day

1013
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,575
It doesn't always lead to that

1014
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
But those already happen

1015
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
This is rhetoric that you find

1016
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:20,511
Yeah pre-loading it

1017
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
Yeah it was same way that it went Alex talks

1018
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,655
Like a lot of his like they're going to pull false flag

1019
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
The terrorist edging

1020
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Kind of

1021
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:34,591
Yeah always lead to some kind of violent outburst

1022
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
And it's

1023
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,943
Whether or not it's just unacceptable

1024
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,991
Yeah like I think that there are

1025
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Reasonable

1026
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,087
Differences of opinion people can have

1027
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
About immigration

1028
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Asian policy

1029
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
I think that you

1030
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Can yeah

1031
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
I think there's a line where your

1032
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
Opinion

1033
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,815
My rear end too dangerous

1034
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
And I still think those conversations

1035
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
You can have on those fronts

1036
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
When you're talkin like this

1037
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
About people from other

1038
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Countries in other cultures

1039
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
That's not

1040
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Policy pay

1041
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
That's not a conversation this is just

1042
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,479
There's nothing that you can

1043
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,039
Do to engage with this other than to say

1044
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:15,807
This is

1045
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Disgusting

1046
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
This deserves

1047
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Condemnation

1048
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
People who would

1049
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
Sincerely present ideas like this

1050
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Have no place in public discourse

1051
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,911
Your beard both talking mess I would very much like

1052
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
The conversation but

1053
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
Between political parties and

1054
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
Even ideology

1055
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Needs to be like

1056
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,175
Should a progressive income tax be like

1057
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
47%

1058
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
Or should it be a graduated income-tax it starts at 90% for your first million and then gradually decreases from

1059
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
Or should it be

1060
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,999
Be a great conversation with different ideologies

1061
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Not

1062
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:02,655
We should kill them because they want to text us slightly more than we're used to

1063
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:08,799
And the rest of the world are basically cavemen kill them too

1064
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,639
And there are cavemen that come out of every group

1065
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,711
I had to look at Christian ideas

1066
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,271
Neighbors

1067
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,343
And do better society and that's what's built our world

1068
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
What's the question

1069
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,671
You don't want that

1070
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
They don't want

1071
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
To deal with chivalry

1072
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
And private property

1073
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
And women and children

1074
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
Children Medical experiments and having sex with

1075
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
York

1076
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Wow

1077
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
He realizes

1078
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,711
That America is not that alright

1079
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
And that

1080
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
All of our stuff

1081
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
Just came from somewhere else

1082
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
So like

1083
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
Some stuff we got from

1084
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,999
Asia some stuff we got from Africa

1085
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
And some stuff we got four

1086
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,887
From Europe I know that Jesus was big on private property

1087
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:10,239
Loved it every second amendment easier to get into heaven

1088
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,823
For a rich person then it is to heaven

1089
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
F****** by a Campbell

1090
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
Walking to Heaven if you're rich

1091
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,223
Look bro if you're rich it's tough to get into heaven

1092
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
You should have every right to calculate all your stuff

1093
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Hold on

1094
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,367
I mean imagine you're going to heaven

1095
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,767
Write in your in the waiting room and you meet your imaginary friend and he's like I got some evil s*** to tell about you

1096
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:38,399
One second and you give him a hundred-dollar bill and he's like well

1097
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,031
You had a good day see that's how you get into heaven if you're rich you bribe the fuel

1098
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,871
It's called it's called

1099
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
Ecclesiastical capture

1100
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
I believe it's

1101
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Find all of this

1102
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,599
Awful trying to make everything funny

1103
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
Really want to light fires

1104
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
I mean it's just

1105
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
It looks kind of like a kind of interesting experience on my end because going to be head to

1106
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,703
Two wacky episodes last weekend so covid

1107
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
I keep being like

1108
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,055
Come on anything else

1109
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Hey quit

1110
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,151
Quit scaremongering about vac

1111
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,991
Vaccines and then he's like okay well I guess I'll go kerbals

1112
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,319
Immigrants are people

1113
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:33,183
On an interesting

1114
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
Demons or Heaven

1115
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,791
Alex might not be in the best

1116
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,519
He did have he was feeling in a good mood though people were talking about him on Twitter that makes me feel good

1117
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,919
Because he got up really early this morning

1118
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,991
I'm going to try to calm down

1119
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
Wild Horses couldn't drag me away but I've been up since

1120
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,855
Exaggerate

1121
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,839
I've been running around the house my wife woke her up cuz I was

1122
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,631
Yelling at people on the telephone

1123
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,543
I'm there anybody on the other end

1124
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,127
Watching attack over watching the UNC

1125
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
The people on welfare piss him off and make him a white people

1126
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,295
Doing that to class

1127
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,367
Where they're saying officially in Tampa says whites are bad

1128
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,439
Comedy classes why can't be in the gym

1129
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:40,767
Total divide-and-conquer

1130
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,863
Culture destroy our Unity

1131
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
And totally rejected

1132
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Yeah

1133
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,711
There's a war on whites and that's why I was yelling into the phone right now but morning and woke his wife up

1134
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,247
When she's mad but he's normal

1135
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,623
Norva this is a normal response to have when there's a war on white

1136
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Good

1137
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,279
I think I think that Alex is like a big-time racist

1138
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,351
And I really like dangerous antiinmigrante type

1139
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
Right but I also think that this mood really does have to

1140
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,007
To do with that video I think I think that it really does think

1141
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
I used to be f******

1142
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,407
Good looking

1143
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:34,271
If you don't appreciate Dad losing it all

1144
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Right now

1145
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
I'm sorry I'm not real

1146
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
And so yeah

1147
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
I don't look

1148
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,071
Like I used to I could look a lot better I'm not family looks great 67 years old

1149
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,119
All the stress I

1150
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
I stayed up

1151
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,215
Nothing to coffee

1152
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,263
Probably two nights a week

1153
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
For the first 45 years I was on air

1154
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
20

1155
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Hours a day

1156
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
I had edited all the film

1157
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
Why would a head jobs on top of it

1158
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,503
I did the sales job the radio station

1159
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
I didn't care about the mission

1160
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,951
Look like a war hardened Goblin

1161
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,999
I do and

1162
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:22,143
I'm not trying to win pretty boy contest around here to take on the plane

1163
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,751
Myself to Bringing Down the New World Order

1164
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,799
Because I will not spiritually

1165
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
And I will not genetically

1166
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,127
Sign on to what state is doing

1167
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
All you people

1168
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
Spell tyranny

1169
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,319
Over there

1170
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,927
Leonardo DiCaprio you just rub skin creams on your faces Alden

1171
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
When you die

1172
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,375
Your soul and your energy is going to be sunken the middle of a black hole with all the energy just like you

1173
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
I don't care about this body

1174
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
What does the Warren White

1175
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
Let me ask you a question

1176
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
For all of his

1177
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
You just see how

1178
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:12,575
Evil they look on TV just evil they're ugly the world

1179
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,111
Know if you're pretty

1180
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,159
Then you're evil

1181
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,559
Skin cream on yourself all day

1182
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Battle-hardened God

1183
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
Okay alright

1184
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,959
I am starting to think that he might be a bit

1185
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Hypocrite

1186
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:34,079
I think he's an idiot I also do love though the idea that he's like

1187
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
I took out all the stress I took all the pain of the world and that's why I look like a mess

1188
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,063
Yeah that was that was definitely him talking to him not me

1189
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,671
Yeah it's totally fine you're a hero

1190
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
You do not need to do voices

1191
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,791
Look I'm not in great shape

1192
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,351
And 10 one of the reasons is

1193
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Because

1194
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
I don't try as hard

1195
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
Sure

1196
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,495
I'll be straight up about that I think it's probably because of

1197
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
The fight

1198
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
Do Auburn have to go if it's the fight

1199
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:11,967
I'm busy you care more about the mission no I'm busy but I also

1200
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Shoes

1201
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,319
Things like unhealthy food

1202
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,855
Could exercise

1203
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:21,183
Or I could watch another episode of Survivor

1204
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,719
Sometimes I choose the Survivor

1205
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Look

1206
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
I'm here

1207
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Nonsense

1208
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Absolutely not anyway

1209
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Globalist

1210
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,935
Save a plant

1211
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
They want to make their sales

1212
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,383
Completely clear about

1213
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,343
All this news all day but you understand that the

1214
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879
Big corporations the world

1215
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,719
Believe that they're going to develop super Technologies

1216
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,791
A Salesman word either Delaware forever

1217
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,631
They're worth an overpopulated Planet will hurt

1218
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
The planet

1219
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,239
Hertz are nests to live forever on

1220
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,383
And they go on in their own papers around statements

1221
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,807
Feels like Highlander

1222
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
It's okay

1223
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,743
Is like you know like we can be killed by violent right right

1224
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Right

1225
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Right haha

1226
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,143
Haha create their cells

1227
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
To be immortal

1228
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,471
There's too many people to their immortal

1229
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
I don't want to run

1230
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
Getting in the way of their

1231
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:45,919
They're fun because you are because you know what you know what I think of these Immortal people who know what they would really love to do is

1232
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Spend their time

1233
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
In an agrarian exist

1234
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,807
Growing their own food

1235
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
You know not having people

1236
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,159
Society around

1237
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,743
Weathers delegations of Labor in places

1238
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,071
So we can all do different things out of the deal with her

1239
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
Basic necessities

1240
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,143
All the time

1241
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,495
Set reminder this reminds me of

1242
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,823
If there's like a couple thousand Goebbels how are they going to have a Sanitation

1243
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
System

1244
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
What are we going to do

1245
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
Well I mean in asimov's the robots of dawn

1246
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,783
Trilogy one forgot about the robots

1247
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,111
I believe what happened is they went off to another planet

1248
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
The immortal

1249
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,183
Rich people

1250
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,231
And they had giant massive Estates

1251
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,279
Covered with nothing but robots that

1252
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
Took care of everything

1253
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
For them

1254
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,887
And then never saw an another human being in real life

1255
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,215
They always got video chatted essentially

1256
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Ian

1257
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,543
Man came

1258
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,591
And he was like this is terrible

1259
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,871
And then they were like

1260
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,663
Yeah I think you might be right yeah it's

1261
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
Dystopia

1262
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
This is

1263
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
Yeah the point of those novels like that are generally like

1264
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:03,231
Oh no this is what happens when rich people have ideas

1265
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:07,071
Technology is a great thing and it could be used in a lot of good ways but laugh

1266
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,447
Dr. go entirely in One Direction.

1267
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Any wife

1268
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
I believe

1269
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
That's a Alex

1270
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Has no business

1271
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Speaking on public issues

1272
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
He is a

1273
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
Toxic awful s*******

1274
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,199
Navagraga list

1275
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
They might have thought differently at various point

1276
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
And Alex's career

1277
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
This is so stupid

1278
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,207
Talk to them at their level about

1279
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
Then you don't deserve to live

1280
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,215
You'll be able to

1281
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
Bring your perspective to the table

1282
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
And we will listen

1283
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
But if you just

1284
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,895
Opposed

1285
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,199
The public is profaned or evil

1286
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
And you want to join us later

1287
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,671
You eat that say that a bit now like everyone probably just

1288
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Deserves to die

1289
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
Yeah he does say that quite a bit

1290
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,047
I want I want to say one thing

1291
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
I don't

1292
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,143
Know if

1293
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
I believe

1294
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,471
That

1295
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
The devil

1296
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,823
Was trying to enlist Alex when he was a little kid

1297
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
And then throughout his entire life

1298
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:27,967
Haven't simultaneously the globalist have been trying to enlist him

1299
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Like it seems like maybe that's

1300
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
In his head

1301
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:35,391
Either that or there's a coup

1302
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,439
Full court press for the past

1303
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,719
30 years

1304
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:43,327
To get Alex Jones on the time before he ever had political inclination

1305
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,983
I was like a predestination thing childhood magical ability

1306
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
I will new would be a problem for in later little bit psychic

1307
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,079
Hahaha

1308
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,943
Possibility is is making all this up

1309
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
Could be another one is

1310
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
These nuts

1311
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
Is

1312
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,855
I mean the Alex's the hint

1313
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
Avalanche Panda pond with

1314
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
All time and history relies

1315
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
Like he is

1316
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,767
As goes Alex

1317
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Sogos hiss

1318
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,119
It does feel like that is his Central thesis

1319
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
I can't imagine a more

1320
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,591
Person in the world is the things he saying are true

1321
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,687
The devil tried to recruit him and then his enemies and tried to recruit him

1322
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
By the way

1323
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,831
Control all of the world's governments that all of the monetary systems

1324
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,391
They've tried to recruit him

1325
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,927
When they were trying to recruit him

1326
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,975
They would have allowed his input

1327
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,815
To go into their plans

1328
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,143
The globalist initially wanted him to moderate

1329
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:56,543
It's their globalist plans with his perspective or at least his ideas

1330
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
Kind of makes me question whether or not the globalist

1331
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Plans

1332
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,479
For a long time seemed like if they were still looking

1333
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,599
Cantor input from a twelve-year-old Berkshire their plans were not good

1334
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
Find me portable

1335
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:16,255
So f****** stupid

1336
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,047
Congratulations Rogan

1337
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:24,447
Hanging out with a f****** xenophobic racist to think he's the most important person in the world congrats

1338
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
Yeah yeah that's great

1339
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,567
His show is the way it is

1340
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
Because of choices that have been made

1341
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,175
Over the course of

1342
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
The last

1343
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:35,967
Couple decades

1344
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
He has fine-tuned to show in Waze

1345
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
I like this works

1346
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
For me

1347
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
This isn't the way we do things

1348
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
But you know what

1349
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Kind of sucks

1350
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,047
Analysis like I wanted this she'll have to be the way it is that's a good question

1351
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,095
Empowered

1352
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
I feel inrage the Goblin

1353
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
Get angry

1354
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,151
I really want to try to start doing a show this commercial free music free

1355
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,991
Very small crew off the weather's great crocosmia podcast

1356
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
It's crazy it's the latest show

1357
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,319
Evolve

1358
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,855
I like it but it is

1359
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,671
And it's frustrating

1360
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,463
It's not really who I am

1361
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,535
What

1362
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:25,631
I was wrong about the good in the world and the beauty in the world and the good part of

1363
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:32,031
Squirrels goddamn

1364
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
Starry night and how it evokes

1365
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:47,391
Hotel motion beyond all reason to tell you about why Humanity should not be destroyed

1366
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,303
Dumb dick to advocate for love

1367
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,655
I really do enjoy the way he's like

1368
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
Alright the show evolve the way it did but this isn't me

1369
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,663
This absolutely this show is definitely not an expression

1370
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,967
Of my rapidly deteriorating mine

1371
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,527
It's frenetic and fast

1372
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
That's my way of saying I never really cover anything but that's not

1373
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,999
All of Me

1374
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,535
The globalist

1375
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
My children upset me sometimes

1376
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
Look at that.

1377
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Yeah

1378
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,471
There are thousands of fake ideology

1379
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
Thousands of fake gurus

1380
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,591
Thousands of false tool that the system doesn't block

1381
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,127
And the system doesn't care about

1382
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,503
It's going to make it all okay

1383
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
No

1384
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,879
There is a scientific development

1385
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,487
Kill everybody machines become God

1386
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,535
The planets

1387
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,095
Happening

1388
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
What's coming after all of us

1389
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
I have no desire

1390
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
In fact I have a roboutian

1391
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,359
And a repulsion of being part of it

1392
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,503
And if you don't have a revulsion of these people

1393
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,343
You are not in God's orbit and you got a serious problem

1394
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,391
Got a serious problem, cuz the devil

1395
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,719
In the form of these people who want to become robots

1396
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
Yeah for a guy who wants

1397
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Schools to teach

1398
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,375
Which that black people came to America because

1399
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,167
Because they were looking for jobs in a free market

1400
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,007
I don't know how much I want him telling me what

1401
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
Schools are telling the truth

1402
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
No

1403
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,151
Reasonable point

1404
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
The beginnings there with like

1405
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,503
There are a lot of things that should be banned

1406
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
From YouTube that are

1407
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,343
And it is it is a little strange that there is

1408
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
You know the thing

1409
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
Get the attention

1410
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
That are necessary for them

1411
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
Take action and the things

1412
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,511
Is that the don't you know like

1413
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
Like I can see all kinds of like

1414
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
Space cult

1415
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,655
Probably being as dangerous

1416
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,191
To somebody

1417
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,519
When you look at some of the investigative reporting on

1418
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Facebook and how they not just

1419
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,407
Kowtow to conservatives but actively

1420
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Like help them out

1421
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
You're like

1422
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
You're not wrong

1423
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,623
Corporations are evil Dave there's these ideologies that are

1424
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Sharkbanz

1425
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,487
I guess the answer will be even

1426
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,047
More social media Crackdown

1427
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,631
Cuz I I don't think the answer is just let anyone say whatever they want

1428
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,935
Doesn't seem like he doesn't last YouTube

1429
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Decided that

1430
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,983
Exactly what they want their

1431
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
And then

1432
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
I think I could leave

1433
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,543
Cousin problems

1434
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Probably

1435
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
But

1436
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
I don't know the devil

1437
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,295
He's coming he's usually, Alex knows this because he

1438
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
He's connected to God

1439
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
And he's also connected to the devil

1440
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Okay we've heard him say that we worked him say that he has a weird position living in between both

1441
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,071
Both Worlds and then it goes

1442
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:07,839
Real bad

1443
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,703
And I can see

1444
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,495
These guys

1445
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,031
The sunglasses on

1446
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
I want you to put the sunglasses on and we're not going to be fighting

1447
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,343
The Haitians are a weapon that the globalist of controlled and dominated and enslaved as slaves

1448
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
Hundreds and hundreds of year

1449
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Gold bars flavors

1450
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
To us

1451
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:36,767
And there's some up or terribly evil people

1452
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
Just like everybody else but the point is they're coming

1453
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,863
End of the globalist pan

1454
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,679
To be controlled and use the political weapon

1455
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,239
I'm all for water

1456
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,335
I love beautiful lakes and waterfalls I love to water-ski

1457
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
And I love to do all that stuff

1458
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Around the jet ski

1459
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:57,503
45 minutes till I die

1460
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
Dirty corrupted water

1461
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,231
Being brought to our dirty corrupted country to bring us

1462
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,023
Energy

1463
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
Jesus

1464
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Right

1465
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
So Haitians

1466
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,679
Don't care about their children or with

1467
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
Pictures are like

1468
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,311
Thugs survival

1469
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,895
Yep and then not just that but they are also a

1470
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
Tool and a weapon

1471
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,783
A pretty standard nationalist ideology go to

1472
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,367
The other populations from like develop

1473
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
10 countries are being used as a

1474
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,463
Weapon by the globe

1475
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
Alex says

1476
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
Quite a bit

1477
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,607
I just don't like the idea of like the Haitians are like water they're dirty

1478
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Did water

1479
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
God what the f*** is wrong with you

1480
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Yeah that's

1481
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
Really really

1482
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Really

1483
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
These immigrants are being brought in because that'll take down America

1484
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
And then once

1485
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
America's gone there'll be nothing

1486
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,199
Sing to fight the Antichrist

1487
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,527
Yeah that's right this is where this is going

1488
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,903
They're being brought here as a political weapon just like every other group is

1489
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,487
Because once the country goes down they'll be no other example of America

1490
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
And the whole world's going to go down

1491
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
And fold Antichrist control

1492
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:23,263
Why

1493
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,407
Halftime Folk

1494
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
It's only the halftime this Alien Force

1495
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,551
Is going to win at halftime but rules in the 4th quarter

1496
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Okay

1497
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
So

1498
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
I don't know

1499
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
Think it's a little bit funny

1500
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
That like

1501
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,023
I don't know

1502
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Skeptic

1503
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
And all those

1504
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Does Certo

1505
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
Communities are

1506
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,959
Pretty into being like

1507
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
Starbucks stock

1508
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,031
Oh yeah yeah he believes that

1509
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Yeah

1510
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
You know I think it's

1511
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
I think it's weird

1512
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
And then

1513
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,455
And then it all in and then it made perfect sense

1514
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Because

1515
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
For people who

1516
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,063
Prophesy should all the time

1517
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
Prophecy is coming true

1518
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Is aren't in Port

1519
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
But because

1520
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:18,047
If it's the only thing that could possibly validate your religion

1521
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,351
Is it all of your prophecies come true

1522
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
That's it

1523
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
And the Book of Revelations

1524
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,447
Is done

1525
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,519
There's you can't make more Book of Revelation

1526
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,079
So is the Book of Revelations doesn't happen

1527
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,871
As it's written

1528
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,687
But your religion is a lie

1529
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,015
Or it requires a reinterpretation

1530
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
Sure

1531
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,855
Sure but they're basing their

1532
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,183
He's raising his Bible on that it's the literal

1533
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
Truth of God

1534
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:46,975
Sure

1535
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:52,863
By God's for him it's a problem so to fight against what happens in The Book of Revelation

1536
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
Is to blaspheme against

1537
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
God himself

1538
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:02,079
And say that you have power over here I'll see I thought about that but then I think that another way to look

1539
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,639
Look at it is that Alex has doomed

1540
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,919
Himself to a losing

1541
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
Fight

1542
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,783
And that he has cast himself in the role of the people who played against the aunt

1543
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Antichrist

1544
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,879
Toulouse Aptos

1545
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
Sure and that's the position he's putting them

1546
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
Southend

1547
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
Digging some kind of

1548
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,583
I think I think it allows him

1549
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
2

1550
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,703
Say these kinds of things that he says about immigrant give these positions

1551
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Be such a toxic

1552
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Awful

1553
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:34,079
Danger is Persona and still

1554
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,919
Pretend that he's a good person like somehow like there is there's a

1555
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
There's Integrity to what I'm doing

1556
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,295
Because I'm fighting against the Antichrist

1557
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,159
Like I'm going down with the ship or whatever as opposed to like I'm just trying to get people

1558
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,511
Look at it if you want to sleep

1559
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,607
If you want to sleep that is a good way to recontextualizing your monstrous action

1560
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,911
Alex said he was going to

1561
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,471
Get back to talking about that video of him

1562
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
When he was younger cuz that's

1563
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
Fun

1564
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
That is fine but turns out

1565
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
There's no time for

1566
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
Fun mr. Jones

1567
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,199
You know I said I'd get to the fun Alex Jones thing

1568
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Casino fun

1569
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
Enough fun Abilene

1570
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
Dogs 2

1571
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135
Maybe I'll do it

1572
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:23,743
Doctor coming on it was in the hospital and watch them basically killing people

1573
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,071
Athan Runner who they wouldn't get medication to

1574
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,143
We demanded I give him medication today

1575
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
SWAT team

1576
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
Hospital

1577
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,543
For 4 hours

1578
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
I didn't run out of the hospital and we said hey

1579
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Let us know what happens while they wouldn't give the guy any Aid

1580
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,391
Hospital doing

1581
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,743
He was a long-term medical doctor he's retired

1582
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
He was telling what they

1583
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
Monex

1584
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,679
And they just said no there's no time for fun

1585
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,263
Cuz you got to interview this guy who was in a hospital

1586
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Text to a guy

1587
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
And then

1588
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
SWAT team

1589
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
I don't know that's pretty confusing

1590
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,015
I would like a more concrete narrative about

1591
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:22,623
The guy comes on the show but a little bit

1592
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
I don't even think it's at the gas

1593
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Let's do this

1594
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
This guy with the backup

1595
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
The story

1596
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
I think that's a little bit

1597
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
Yeah but there is still some time for fun

1598
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
And it says teenage

1599
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Content creator

1600
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Alex Jones

1601
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,943
You going to say there's an underlying story here

1602
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
Did he get a head injury at some point after this

1603
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,575
Cuz I was so nice and friendly and sweet

1604
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,391
There's a tens of thousands of tweets of women saying

1605
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
Really nice guy

1606
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,071
New about all this stuff and I was finding it

1607
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,119
Lived it and went through 20

1608
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
728 years of it

1609
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,959
Took a toll on me

1610
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,055
Caring about myself and my family everybody else

1611
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
I can't do much that's why I'm not this

1612
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
Sensible seeming

1613
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
Hot young man anymore

1614
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,527
There's no way I could change my Offspring Have It

1615
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
Snowbird

1616
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,623
That's what that's what I think is really interesting is that like there's a

1617
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,695
Physical defensiveness that Alex has about like how

1618
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
People singing used to be hot

1619
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,279
There's also a defensiveness

1620
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,815
You seem like a normal person

1621
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,095
Like there's like

1622
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
You have

1623
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,167
Lost it both physically and

1624
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,215
Emotionally and intellectually

1625
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
You are a

1626
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
Essentially a completely different

1627
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
In the like

1628
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,663
Madden stat level

1629
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,735
They've all gone down Universal

1630
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
It's like it's like

1631
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
It's like

1632
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,135
The difference between Madden Drew Brees in 2001

1633
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,975
And Madden Drew Brees in 2014 there's a big difference

1634
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:08,351
Category that Alex is still really high at

1635
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,679
That's true he still got it yeah he does still got it

1636
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Better

1637
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
It turns out

1638
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
Is releasing films

1639
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,615
Cuz you know it's been a long time

1640
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
Confused as to how he's got

1641
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
I'm better about

1642
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Well I mean

1643
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,759
It's been like 9 years since he did it

1644
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
Well that is better

1645
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
Get back on the horse

1646
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,111
Need to fight back against the new lockdown

1647
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,695
That's why we made a new film the first of the five-part series

1648
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,999
Full film called coven land

1649
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:40,095
Robert Kennedy Jr Dr Sherri Tenpenny myself everybody else star-studded

1650
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,631
Restart traffic.

1651
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
Reverend proud of the cell

1652
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,751
A British gentleman because I fired

1653
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,543
Yeah

1654
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,407
Yep I don't got I don't got any in-house production staff

1655
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,943
Got to go somewhere else

1656
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,783
We will keep coming up with ideas and I fire a pic Gators Gates

1657
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,343
Signal is gone up

1658
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
I may have to check in on

1659
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:06,207
Covid lab documentary

1660
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
So this.

1661
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
Doctor comes on

1662
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,815
Stephen Belafonte

1663
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:16,959
His deal was that he was in the hospital being treated for covid and he decided he would go ahead and play doctor for the person playing

1664
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Tire Doctor

1665
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,919
He's way up on current Medical Technology I'm sure

1666
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,479
Javonte looked over the guys records

1667
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,527
You got permission from the guy in the

1668
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,927
So it's not like a total violation of pneumonia diagnosis

1669
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,231
And they wouldn't listen to him when he brought it up

1670
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,791
The next details are a little bit hazy because it

1671
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:46,399
It's just kevantes telling of the story because obviously the hospital can't comment on the treatment

1672
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
Given to a third person without their

1673
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Arkansas

1674
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,543
Other patients ad

1675
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,079
Advocate let the nurses

1676
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
Call the doctor so excited

1677
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,711
Like he was going to check himself out against medical advice right

1678
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,783
At that point allegedly he was restrained for a while and then he was

1679
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,647
Discharge from hospital against medical advice

1680
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,743
From the story something that doesn't match up

1681
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:12,767
Anyway

1682
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
I don't think I'll tell you one thing that I know for

1683
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,887
The fact is in that story and left out

1684
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,703
That guy was an a****** to a bunch of people

1685
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,239
Belligerence I would assume

1686
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:27,359
Or I think that there is a possible liability that the hospital could take on

1687
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,711
Totally this guy is acting as a doctor inappropriately like

1688
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:36,831
You can't do that just because this guy says like I am his medical Advocate or whatever does

1689
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Mean

1690
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
That there isn't still a lawsuit possible

1691
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,975
I don't know I don't know exactly but there's something missing

1692
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,303
I don't really care about what it is right

1693
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Because

1694
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
This guy

1695
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
Davonte

1696
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
Comes on Alex's show

1697
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,031
Are you talkin about this other patient there was there in the hospital with him

1698
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
And this guy is dying

1699
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,383
And now there's a funeral that's going to happen

1700
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Alex

1701
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,991
It's really excited kind of about this story anyway that's just

1702
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:10,879
And by the way did you talk to the families that how you got photos of the man would you like to say his name or they want that

1703
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Humanizing

1704
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,743
His name is is Keith

1705
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
And his funeral is

1706
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Next

1707
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,607
Next Saturday

1708
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,191
And there's a GoFundMe page

1709
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,263
As far as hero

1710
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,823
Kids are looking at our

1711
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:35,455
I didn't know that so I'm glad you're back on can you dock look that up or let us know

1712
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,807
Like to get his children on a guy's The Producers can we call

1713
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,391
Mother daughter cancer

1714
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,207
Antiviruses sv40 Restylane

1715
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Dad dad

1716
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,583
Wow what a doctor telling us about that

1717
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:57,471
Wow he's Alex's just decided that this woman who he knows nothing about had a cancer that must have

1718
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Have been caused by vaccines

1719
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Oh wow

1720
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,335
What a way to turn this this

1721
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,871
This tragedy into something

1722
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
Profitable in your anti-vax

1723
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
Phuc yea

1724
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,343
If this doctor is offended by missing a pneumonia diagnosis offended by that

1725
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
No cuz he is

1726
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
Cuz he's a she

1727
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Absolute

1728
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,023
And so one of the things that he did was

1729
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,071
If you took a picture of this guy

1730
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
Not in the hospital

1731
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
And posted it on Facebook

1732
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,399
Facebook

1733
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
Presumably

1734
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
He got permission from the guy

1735
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
Keith

1736
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,031
Time to post

1737
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
This picture on Facebook

1738
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,335
Papa guess what

1739
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,359
The family

1740
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
Is not thrilled about

1741
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223
Have you had a chance to talk to the family

1742
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,527
I yes

1743
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,343
They were not happy with me

1744
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,391
Overstaying his

1745
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
Hospital

1746
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
On on Facebook

1747
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,279
But I'm afraid

1748
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Where's my Facebook

1749
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
Post that got

1750
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
That got him

1751
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,703
Antibiotics and

1752
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:06,591
Noi Channel

1753
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
Yes

1754
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Yeah you knew him better than his kids

1755
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
Wow

1756
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
I mean

1757
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:21,439
I can't imagine

1758
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
Like

1759
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
If it

1760
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Because here's the story

1761
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
That you could

1762
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
Tell

1763
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
I guess

1764
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
Is

1765
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,191
Either

1766
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
The patients

1767
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:33,983
Says

1768
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,799
Nonono current doctors

1769
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Listen to this

1770
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,615
80 year old man

1771
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Miami be like 70

1772
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
And then

1773
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,967
Give me what he says right

1774
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
And then

1775
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
There's no way you wouldn't

1776
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:51,647
Sue the hospital later and be like how f****** dare you take the advice of this crazy person right

1777
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,255
I don't know how to do that

1778
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
To him

1779
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Is

1780
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,327
Insane

1781
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
I don't understand

1782
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
How

1783
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,447
I don't understand how this guy to show this

1784
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
Avanti

1785
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
Can look in the mirror

1786
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
And

1787
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,847
Recognize that the family of this

1788
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Person

1789
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,151
Like

1790
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
Davonte isn't somebody who's

1791
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,479
Relevant at all

1792
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:21,855
The only reason that he is even on Alex's shows cuz he was in the hospital next to this guy

1793
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
To be f*****

1794
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
In an episode of Scrubs

1795
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
The other guy

1796
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,279
Is essentially what Vic Avanti is riding

1797
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,327
To attention on

1798
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
And

1799
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,911
The family does not appreciate that

1800
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
And

1801
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,007
V8 just appearing on the show

1802
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,287
And discussing this stuff

1803
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
Is legitimately

1804
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
You can

1805
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,663
Safe assumption against the wishes of the family

1806
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
It's an insult

1807
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,735
Degrading

1808
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,039
End-to-end to then have

1809
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,831
Alex be like oh yeah

1810
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,647
Young people don't want attention until their emotional

1811
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
I mean

1812
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
Now

1813
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,839
So he keeps mentioning that they have a GoFundMe for the funeral

1814
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
And

1815
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
The plug it and I

1816
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
Very glad actually that he doesn't

1817
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,983
Actually knows what it is

1818
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
It's not like a

1819
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Choice

1820
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,592
These people

1821
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
I'm glad

1822
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,944
Mostly because

1823
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,480
Seems pretty clear

1824
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
The family does

1825
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
Not like this guy at all

1826
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:27,392
But I'm sure the family appreciates you now trying to save their father

1827
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
Ya never know

1828
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,792
Remember doctors are the Bringers of bad news

1829
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
So I don't know if I'll find out

1830
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
Appreciate me or not

1831
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,752
At the funeral

1832
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,848
No do not have much to go to his funeral

1833
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
And you know

1834
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:49,920
I mean

1835
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,504
Can I say the lady wants it was choking

1836
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Great

1837
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:59,136
Look if someone if you don't if you're not sure the family is going to be pissed off at you or not

1838

1841
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,400
Call SWAT team

01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
Rocking chair for 4 hours

1843
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472

That's just that level of like

1849
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,528
Maybe you don't have any empathy

1850
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
Like that's just it

1851
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,576
Insane

1852
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
That's just

1853
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,624
So f****** disc

1854
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,904
Respectful

1855
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
I mean just

1856
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:37,792
Exploitative and all in your own service to make

1857
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:44,192
You feel like you were importing row and a hero yeah absolutely

1858
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
From boring

1859
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,264
Like okay maybe this guy had a

1860
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,288
Misdiagnosis of the

1861
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
The person

1862
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
Next to him in the hospital and I don't

1863
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,384
Care to like

1864
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,968
Wow it's really clear even from the way you are talking

1865
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,760
That this family is not

1866
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,552
Thrilled with your behavior

1867
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
And how your

1868
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
Exploiting their loved one

1869
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
And that's f***** up

1870
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
That is not

1871
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
It's just wrong

1872
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,512
I mean it's gone skywok

1873
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,888
Furious if he went on local access news

1874
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,424
Let alone to go on

1875
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
F****** info

1876
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,520
Talking about like your loved one

1877
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,336
Oh my God

1878
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:28,480
Absolutely we want last clip and it's Alex discussing we we've heard him talk

1879
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,504
B about

1880
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,552
Like you know there's

1881
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,832
People getting covid around

1882
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,136
We haven't really talked

1883
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,928
I heard him talk about like

1884
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Some specific

1885
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
And it turns out

1886
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
His parents

1887
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
Especially his dad

1888
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,864
Maybe it'll really severe case

1889
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,144
Father

1890
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Grandmother got sick

1891
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
5 weeks

1892
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
I told the story

1893
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Incredible

1894
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Apparent

1895
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
My mommy

1896
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Triathlete

1897
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
And

1898
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
That does well

1899
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,904
But they did tell me they were sick

1900
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,488
And I will accept this is serious I go over there

1901
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,280
And my dad is

1902
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
Not knowing who he is

1903
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,264
And he looks blue

1904
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,872
Call dr. Barbara he sends over medical doctors he knows the house there was no straight people

1905
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,200
Mother french benefits being Alex Jones there's like they're like an hour

1906
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Being rich

1907
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,808
They thought they got a small Pharmacy

1908
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
I got the

1909
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,184
Ivermectin got the

1910
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
Pill steroids they said

1911
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,048
Neymar making do this and that making breathing

1912
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,864
I was literally not slapping but like 10 she would say

1913
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,216
Back to sleep my mom's doing the same thing

1914
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,752
And he lost

1915
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
Like 20-something

1916
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,056
He's not fat

1917
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
Like I am and

1918
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,968
By the next morning again they delivered a bunch of lawn chairs again

1919
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
And he was there putting them together

1920
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,856
Now his mind at a fog

1921
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,792
2 Days Later was back at 97%

1922
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,864
And that was the Ivermectin that was a steroid and we know

1923
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
I don't believe that

1924
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,680
Number

1925
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,752
One of them is that Alex has always said

1926
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
These things

1927
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
Are like

1928
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
Their miracle cures

1929
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,848
We got to give it to him

1930
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
People early

1931
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,152
Alex's dad was

1932
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Deep into AC

1933
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,504
Sickness absence there that is not early in

1934
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
It's not like the

1935
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
Even based on the conspiracies and

1936
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
The b******* that Alex bread

1937
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
At that point

1938
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,440
And should not have been helped

1939
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Fulda a.m.

1940
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
Second

1941
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,816
I don't know how much of this is real

1942
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:54,656
I don't know how much of this is true and how much of it is a story Alex's telling

1943
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
But if there is truth to this

1944
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,264
I don't see like

1945
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,848
I don't see it being impossible that Alex got his dad's

1946
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,920
Maybe gave him

1947
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
Something that could be per

1948
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,248
Yes brain fog

1949
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,040
It wasn't there

1950
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,856
You know if

1951
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,672
To whatever extent it is yes absolutely put like

1952
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,232
Just based on what Alex's report

1953
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:23,840
His dad had a brain fog that has not gone away now five weeks later

1954
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
This could be something that he got through

1955
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
Hoosier

1956
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
From Alex

1957
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
Not taking the virus seriously

1958
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
And could that be

1959
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,616
The rest of his life and even if it's not

1960
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
It's deeply traumatic

1961
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,176
Toulouse

1962
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,480
20 lb if you're 71 then

1963
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,296
And end up not knowing your name like fevers

1964
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:46,112
Fever so high you don't know where you are

1965
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,160
This is just sick s***

1966
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,744
I mean and also one thing

1967
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
How can

1968
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,328
Covid

1969
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
Be a bio-weapon

1970
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,656
If everybody you know f******

1971
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,680
Got it and your

1972
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
Well

1973
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
Assume

1974
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,080
Right I mean Alex didn't tell these stories about Alex

1975
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
His family being sick

1976
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:13,504
Him being sick multiple times right for one at the office being sick tell those stories were very long time

1977
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
Friends of Friends

1978
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,112
Or other people who are any good

1979
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
The case back

1980
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,440
Who are dead and we just don't know it

1981
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:25,280
He doesn't know it or if he does he's not going to talk about it absolutely

1982
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,328
Talked about this before

1983
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
When he was

1984
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Did it different stage

1985
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,912
Do the covid graph

1986
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
Like it's just

1987
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
I find this episode to be like

1988
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
I mean

1989
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,568
I declared an episode Reese

1990
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,336
Leon accept

1991
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,664
Right right right

1992
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
It's not wrong

1993
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,992
This is not fit for human consumption it really is

1994
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,576
It's really really really really f***** up

1995
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,648
I don't know how many different ways you can be

1996
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
I mean

1997
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,232
Astonishingly disgusting

1998
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,560
He and his

1999
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,144
Blackwater buddy dehumanize the s*** out of immigrants

2000
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
In ways that are

2001
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,216
Reminiscing

2002
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Yeah

2003
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,568
Of deeply deeply troubling times

2004
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
He gets really bad into feet

2005
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
Sensitive about how to use

2006
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,944
To be hot and not insane

2007
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
He

2008
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,880
Spins weird Yarns about how the devil in the globalist have been trying to enlist him

2009
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,928
How many interviews a guy who's

2010
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,976
Using the memory of

2011
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,792
Someone he was hospitalized with two

2012
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584
Get attention this is

2013
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,608
Just

2014
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,656
All of you

2015
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
This is a

2016
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
This is a real Viking

2017
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
Villains row

2018
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,824
Just like nonstop shiting

2019
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,920
Yeah times when like doing this show is really fun

2020
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,712
You learn about stuff in

2021
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,528
Now and then there's times where I mad that we do this

2022
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:59,232
I don't think I don't think that too I like it this is my job sometimes sometimes

2023
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,560
Interesting and sometimes it's just staring into the

2024
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,096
Gaping maw love

2025
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,376
The depths of

2026
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,144
Human

2027
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,960
Depravity in disgust

2028
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,496
You know just like

2029
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,568
How how can how

2030
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,104
How can you do this

2031
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,152
Snook no argumentation is going

2032
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,176
Going to convince

2033
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,200
Alex or

2034
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
Ex Blackwater guy that

2035
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,552
People from other cultures love their children

2036
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
Or just people

2037
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
Nothing nothing nothing no response

2038
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
That we have

2039
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
Can possibly

2040
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Penetrate

2041
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
That kind of

2042
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
If thinking

2043
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,792
And it's just

2044
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
Depressing

2045
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,096
That

2046
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
People

2047
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
Wood

2048
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,472
Either willingly or unwillingly

2049
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,288
Give Credence and credibility to someone

2050
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,360
Whose job it is to spread b******* like this

2051
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,152
I mean

2052
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
Where We Are

2054
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
We're like

2055
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,272
You

2056
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,344
You have to step back from them

2057
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:00,160
Because you realize that like these people are fuc

2058
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Disgusting in it

2059
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,000
It's too late to like change their mind or anything

2060
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
What needs to be

2061
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
Dresses

2062
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,608

01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400

01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,496
Attaching themselves to this

2067
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
Who are

2068
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,616
I mean I would hope at least a little more fungible in

2069
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:22,688
Let's kill all of non-white peoples

2070
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:29,088
I know you even hope that their their support is based on a lack of awareness not of the things that

2071
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,136
Actually talks about

2072
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
As opposed to them

2073
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
Actually being on board with this

2074
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,000
Horrible vile bullshittin

2075
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,792
It's either that or

2076
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,608
It just be like a Joe Rogan isn't out now.

2077
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,632

2083
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Episode

2084
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:57,504
Until then we wasn't fighting

2085
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,296
