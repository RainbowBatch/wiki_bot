00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Asking yourselves

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264

Yeah it is crazy

16
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,720
An unfortunate this episode does not cover any of that stuff

17
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
The issue we have this

18
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:37,888
Because of our schedules we had to record this on Monday

19
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,240
Before the cycle of Alex Jones is coverage

20
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
Trump's actual speech

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Play itself out

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104

If you are

82
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Hell yes

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Interesting

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
Project Camelot

85
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,879
Doing over there

86
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
For us to go go see

87
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,047
She doesn't have any good episodes

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Through the archives

89
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Irrelevant to our interest

90
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
And maybe something will be Illuminating about

91
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,151
And I happen to find an episode that April 2016

92
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
Weather

93
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,063
Dr. John Waterman

94
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Find

95
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
Well what's the introduction

96
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
Find out if he's a real doctor or not

97
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
What I'd like you to do is give some of your background

98
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
For people that haven't

99
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Familiar with the Waterman files

100
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
I believe it's another shortwave show

101
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
And John does a show

102
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Weekly

103
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Maybe your daily I don't know how often you're doing it nowadays John you can fill me in

104
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
I I do want to say that he is that he was trained as an intelligence agent and decided not to pursue that

105
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
Aware of what

106
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Intel agencies are doing

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
And he was also a

108
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,295
Head of one of the militia groups and tell you more about that so John go ahead

109
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
Alert

110
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
A very curious about it myself gas type

111
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,887
But it is interesting because John Waterman's not his real name so it's not like I'm going to be able to find

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,239
Kuhio I can't figure out who he is and it's a fairly common name there's enough

113
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
You know if you'd if you Google

114
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
John Waters

115
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
John Waters

116
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
I am a doctor of biological medicine it's basically alternative drug therapies that I

117
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
Naturopath

118
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
It is

119
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:22,879
Which is a bad start to this interview

120
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
Meaning of not a doctor not a John Waterman

121
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,047
Open camera

122
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
The number of people who may know him

123
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
So

124
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Whatever it is it's all just

125
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
A little bit

126
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,103
How do you became train

127
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Isn't intelligent

128
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
That's my second career and

129
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,231
A fellow that sin became a very very good friend of mine Frank Shin who's now gone

130
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
I was who recruited Lee

131
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
He came to me when I was doing clinical work and

132
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
And said I'd like to

133
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,519
Have you checked me out so I did came back and he said that

134
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
I need some more help and so about the third trip into

135
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Me he said the

136
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:21,247
Take you out for dinner

137
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
He's like a recruiting him Migos

138
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,487
Text message like I want to make you an agent or whatever and then

139
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,607
Yeah you get to train and all that she's involved in a bunch of separate he's like no medicine is my true love

140
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
You're a naturopath first of all

141
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Big red flags

142
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
With this story right off the bat of course the person who could confirm all of this is gone

143
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
Giant flag

144
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Might be something

145
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Super consist

146
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
SeaWorld

147
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Be very suspicious

148
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,767
Part of someone's backstory can confirm all of this nonsense that I say

149
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
For more information

150
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Baby saying that you

152
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
My lost

153
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Well

00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Condolences

155
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
You've not

156
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,407
Trying to frame this as like I got taught the ways of

157
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
The agent

158
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
It was Mexico explained he was in the ship

159
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,231
I don't understand

160
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,791
Keep going to say that he was involved in like

161
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
The investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing

162
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
He says that the movie Spy game is about human this guy Frank

163
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,335
That sounds right fright the Robert Redford

164
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
I'm not making

165
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
You don't look like Brad Pitt

166
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
And I was

167
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
Several places across the sky

168
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,951
Involved

169
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,791
Domestically on things like helping the rundown Joe number

170
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
John Doe number to the Oklahoma City bombing

171
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,103
Rebellions like the chapas rebellion in Mexico that the revolution of Mexico.

172
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
High-level stuff man

173
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
Like

174
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:36,927

Call Danna foreign Revolution

176
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
Origin story is

00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
Intelli Opera

178
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
From

179
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Juicy later on

180
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
I don't think so

181
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
Isn't that another convenient

182
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,967
Xvii

183
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
So they are going to

184
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
Who is working in a clinical setting

185
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Mysteriously

186
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Right

187
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
They went a few Thai

188
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,839
Feel like the first time they were like he was going there

189
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,447
I don't know if this nature of have is good enough for the side psyop send

190
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Go back again

191
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
Go back one more time

192
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
He thinks that we are

193
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,759
Because I didn't recruit

194
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
These worlds

195
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,327
Weather movie

196
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,447
But unlike those people

197
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Inspiration for movies

198
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Selfie

199
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
He's an inspiration for a movie

200
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,871
During the revolution

201
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Many other

202
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
In the world

203
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
He says he's a pretty good I'm Robert Redford I said will you lucky duck

204
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Step point

205
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
Is this is not a joke

206
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
I started getting all upset

207
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
And he says hey

208
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
You never would answer

209
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
He just said

210
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
Hey you did very good cuz you're

211
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Your Robert

212
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
If you're not Robert Redford Brad Pitt

213
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
I said you're serious

214
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,255
Conversation still friends right

215
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
It was Conversation Over

216
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
What it was

217
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,431
Waterman

218
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,831
Get to be Robert Redford the guy on the other end of the phone is like the middle of a fight

219
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
F*** you you son of a picture Prospect

220
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
I have a lot of concerns about

221
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,119
Credentials

222
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
The future

223
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
In 2016

224
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
The Earth was going

225
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,943
There was a vibrational changes that were happening that we're going to alter our DNA

226
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
Didn't expect this to Robert Redford tell him about possibly

227
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
And we receive these messages

228
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
And or

229
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,303
An interpretation

230
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Anda

231
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
One of the things that

232
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,567
I want to say that you know

233
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
The evidence

234
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Was even Paula Violette talked about it

235
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
He talked about

236
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
Superwave

237
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,111
Possibly headed our Direction but aside from that

238
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,183
It we're going through an area space where this is going to happen

239
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
And

240
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
The DNA is supposed to be changing this isn't

241
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:33,215
He's kind of like a Reclamation of the 2012 - chocolate

242
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,079
Prophesy funneled into

243
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Vibrational changes happening

244
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
I just saved my favorite favorite

245
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Favorite part

246
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
My favorite part of every Project Camelot after

247
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Is the guest

248
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Or carry

249
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Just saying

250
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Haha or right

251
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
To the single most outlandish ridiculous pasta

252
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Simple thing that could

253
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Resetting there just like yeah of course move on

254
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Improv game

255
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
The gravy always off

256
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
An area of

257
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,159
Wednesday

258
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
And

259
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
And

260
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
I don't know

261
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
What you're looking at or what evidence you're looking at

262
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
But

263
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
I can tell you that it is raising the vibration of the planet and and the and the humans

264
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,847
Now there are some people who won't be able to handle the vibration to

265
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
And don't go the opposite direction

266
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,991
From what I do it'll be a bad we have to be compatible

267
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
With the

268
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Well we could say the frequency that

269
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,487
Compatible

270
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
Dissonant with

271
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
You will become

272
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
You will actually begin to

273
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,215
Offer it rather than flow with it is kind of like those

274
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
Movies like we see with Dune flow through you fear is not of your

275
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,711
Problem just let it flow

276
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
You're going to another words resonate

277
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
With it you're going to be much better off than trying to fight it

278
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
It goes on to explain like

279
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
More examples

280
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
Could have just brought up Kenny Loggins

281
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Cut-ups

282
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Surprised

283
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
You want to do

284
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Do you want to talk about dude

285
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
I don't need to I don't need to

286
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Everyone everyone knows

287
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Bruno's

288
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
And how dare you

289
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Butchers

290
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
Frank Herbert did not write a lot of good life

291
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,463
He was a long writer lot of line

292
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Not a lot of good end

293
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Sphere from the Benji

294
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
In the entire book

295
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
Are you sleep

296
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
You know it's some people

297
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Compatible with

298
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,855
I wonder if there's any differences between those sorts of people who are compatible and go to art

299
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
I don't know I don't know what he thinks

300
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Immediately after he said that

301
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,655
I don't know what you're talking about and I refuse to even address this

302
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,263
Set the sky

303
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Animosity towards

304
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
This isn't really what this interview is about even this

305
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
Idea of vibrational changes and all that stuff

306
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,295
Secondary to

307
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
I believe

308
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
Her big issue on this episode

309
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,719
Earthquakes she wants to talk about earthquakes that are coming because she recently

310
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
Come into the possession of a map

311
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,583
That should wear a lot of recent earthquakes were

312
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
And she hasn't

313
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
Just like a map

314
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,639
Ring of fire if it's involved

315
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Explain

316
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
Which we already knew

317
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
There's a very weird

318
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,135
I'm going to find a map to show everyone is on Iris

319
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
It shows you the entire

320
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
What you call that

321
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
The Ring of Fire

322
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
And you can see that

323
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,631
The United States is actually on the west coast right now

324
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,727
Kind of empty of earthquakes very strangely

325
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Eastside

326
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
It's got a lot of it

327
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
And again I think this is

328
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
Manipulation

329
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,759
So whether they're trying to build the energy and then cause

330
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
A huge earthquake

331
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:09,183
Let me just say that Sean David Morton reported on my show that that he knows someone who

332
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,279
He's an older Israeli man who can't lie correctly predicted

333
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
Some things in the past

334
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
Remember that Sean David Morton is the con man

335
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Who got arrested

336
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
Conspiracy Cruise

337
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
Tens of thousands of dollars

338
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
Such a hero of our time Lil weirdo

339
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Why she still listen

340
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,759
Doesn't come on man Cruiser here that he got a rest

341
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
Including the 2008 crash

342
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,327
And he's saying that in November of this year there's going to be a major event for the 9/11

343
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
Recently Sean sent me a text saying

344
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
It's going to be an LA quake

345
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,335
I don't know I have seen

346
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,735
Where we seen a major earthquake in LA

347
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,831
There are going to be major volcanic eruptions as well

348
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,951
Now how much of this is natural and how much is uno humanly engineered

349
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
Because we have a secret government

350
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
And I'm

351
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Illuminati

352
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,983
To have a program an agenda they're working

353
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
And

354
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
If they if it doesn't happen naturally

355
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
They will stimulate it

356
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
So so this is really important

357
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
She's talking about

358
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Control

359
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
She's afraid that the

360
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,695
The Illuminati the government or the globalist

361
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
It's all good

362
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,703
But you also do need to recognize the behind that she has the exact same

363
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Conception with

364
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Slightly different character name

365
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
And more

366
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Yeah

367
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
The cabal

368
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
Ruling the world

369
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
You do you see these

370
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Indications

371
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Mort what I want to say is if she

372
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Is precognitive

373
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Picture

374
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
She shouldn't keep having weirdos

375
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,048
That are so like

376
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,376
She should have seen that any page is a racist Indian

377
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
Baseball players on the planet

378
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
What

379
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Now

380
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
Look I'm just saying

381
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
We have to believe one of

382
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,088
Two things either she's not

383
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
Precognitive

384
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,536
I'm enjoy being around these sorts of people home and if she was a psychic

385
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
F****** with us

386
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Aside for her

387
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
That's not what I was thinking and then

388
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
That's the message she wants

389
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,392
To put out into the world

390
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
The two of us she has been

391
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,488
CNS coming for forever

392
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
That happen

393
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,704
A lot of precogs have predicted a large earthquake in LA

394
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Oh yeah

395
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
I wonder why

396
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
Earthquake

397
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Bidmc

398
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,224
Predicting a large one

399
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Too far outside

400
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Central Missouri

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
I don't know man

402
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
This is wack

403
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
It's not nearly as bad as what about to happen

404
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
Cuz Waterman

405
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
Wants to get in

406
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Do you like

407
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Something

408
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
He's got he's undergone

409
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Vibrational

410
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
They're happening

411
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
Andy has a story that he wants

412
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Tell Carrie about it

413
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
And this

414
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Is nuts

415
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
The changes that are occurring on this planet

416
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
Is that I was

417
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Literally

418
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
In a very serious State I was

419
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Bleeding

420
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
Without

421
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Being cut I was

422
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,528
Abdominal pain

423
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Passed out

424
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,488
Emergency room

425
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
I can't find anything they did

426
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,936
They did x-rays

427
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
Cultures to see if I was

428
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:14,848
There was not a thing they could find

429
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
Until

430
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,248
Serendipitous event where I fell out of Texas sent me an e-mail

431
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
It said something about

432
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Acronym acid

433
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
So I got

434
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Interesting

435
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
That isn't

436
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
So you just had to s*** really hard

437
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
No.

438
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,680
The coronal mass ejection

439
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:45,824
Very close by the letter

440
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
I think that anybody who actually

441
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Probably,

442
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
What's better diagnose

443
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Whatever it is

444
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,768
Unlike

445
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,656
Try not to pretend

446
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
And then

447
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Bringing up solar flares

448
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Better talk to my doctor

449
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Interesting

450
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Who is Doctor

451
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
He talks to somebody else

452
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600
Somebody called me and said I think I know what it is now this is a remote heater

453
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
I think what's going on with you

454
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
Coronal mass ejection

455
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
Ted come out

456
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,360
And I started with my emergency room Vic

457
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
And for some reason

458
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Out of the blue

459
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,272
I became very sensitive to the

460
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
I mean extremely sensitive

461
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Or there was literally something happening

462
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,120
But I have got a calendar where I can track because I

463
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
And

464
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
And tell you I'm extremely

465
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
To a lot of things I can walk out on a day

466
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
For there's a lotta

467
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:33,088
Higher levels of it I can't do it

468
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
In November I have become very yogurt

469
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:46,400
Higher vibrations this is attacks of some sort so everybody

470
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,936
Has been helping had one

471
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
A remote viewer

472
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
But remote heater contact me

473
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,408
And I'll ask me permission to work on me I said your ear

474
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
Happy Grape

475
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,344
They call me back said I can't get anywhere because you've been attacked

476
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
They're blocking everything

477
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:11,232
Troy start having to really

478
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
Investigate

479
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
This potential about

480
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Warfare

481
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
If he's making this up how do you explain the remote healer telling him that he's being attacked

482
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,408
How's that might be a scam also

483
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,456
Olives

484
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
And I look

485
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
If you want to believe what you want to believe

486
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
Stop believing it remote Healers

487
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,416
Victor even one either one who is like

488
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Okay Adam

489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,816
Billionaire

490
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
You'd have to like

491
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,800
You would have to vend assume that they wish ill on mankind

492
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Well

493
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
You have that gift you better never stop working because you are the only one you know it's crazy

494
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
The insurance

495
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Doug cover

496
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,928
Play weird part of Trump's hair

497
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
Crazy but they do recover remote

498
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
I just think like

499
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Yeah when your condition is

500
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
I'm sensitive

501
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
Solar flares

502
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,424
That's exactly when you need a remote dealer

503
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
I love that little

504
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Max where the remote healer tells him to

505
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
He's being attacked

506
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
Feeling isn't working

507
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:40,320
An investigation

508
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:48,768
MLB remote healer back and he was like who exactly the remote I will tell you that for another 15

509
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,424
Literally outside of that what is the investigation

510
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,264
Now I'm afraid of the Sun

511
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,872
I guess the only thing is like staying indoors during a solar flare I guess

512
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Maybe

513
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Google

514
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,528
You know we assume that it's some sort of a solar flare thing

515
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
The culprit

516
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,672
You know what John Waterman has the mother

517
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:23,072
I think I was being attacked I think I did somehow get poisoned fact they did find some

518
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Poison

519
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
I'd like to take you back to 10 minutes

520
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:38,432
Seems very contradictory

521
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
Moderation in all things

522
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
So

523
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
I don't know how

524
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
Jokes

525
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,416
Everybody could be remotely.

526
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,000
So it was a very expensive very interesting

527
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Experience

528
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Mid November

529
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
Thank you John I'm very happy that you that you made it through and you survived

530
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,152
I I had my own attack

531
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,552
Definitely know where you coming from

532
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,880
Look at that the information and what happened

533
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
And it was a it was a descaler attack

534
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
Steelers score

535
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,192
You know people that are out in the public eye

536
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:38,592
They can go under attack by various groups and course the Illuminati are going to concentrate on those of us

537
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
Can influence others

538
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Because of what we're saying and what we're putting out there

539
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Information wise

540
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
Powerful

541
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
What's the Illuminati

542
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
Is there energy on people like

543
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
Waterman

544
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,464
Got to get John watermelon finally Illuminati I'm thinking

545
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
Not a doctor John Waterman out of here

546
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
So they're the ones who are they

547
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Interstellar in

548
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Intergalactic

549
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
Interdimensional Steeler attack

550
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
I don't know

551
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
Something bad I don't know

552
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Twitch

553
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
He is describing

554
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
The powerful

555
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Mind-boggling

556
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,248
In his world there are both remote

557
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Steelers

558
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:24,928
Yep sure there's a car dimensional

559
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Well you know I go outside

560
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
And they can be anywhere

561
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,656
Hey what you going to do

562
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,800
You're not a real man

563
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Because

564
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
A real man

565
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,480
Creeps behind the curtain and he sees that lovecraftian Eldritch Horror

566
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,880
His mind he keeps on fighting

567
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,952
This terrible otherworldly

568
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Awful

569
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
People who don't have the good strong stuff

570
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,240
Turn tail and start working with the Illuminati

571
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
Or

572
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Recall

573
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Shut it

574
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
It seems like

575
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,296
If you have on one side

576
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:34,560
And then on the other side you're you look behind the curtain and you see the Illuminati has remote healers and remote poisoners

577
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,424
I see no evidence that the Illuminati is remote Healers

578
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
We only know that miss being good guys

579
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
World so far we've only heard of them as being on the side of the weirdos

580
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:56,832
You're losing I think it's implied they do have one but it only be poisoning people

581
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,672
Interdimensional scalar attack

582
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,952
Steelers

583
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,536
We got the earthquakes that obviously the Illuminati are going to

584
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Precipitate vibration and stuff like that that are that are causing John Waterman to ship

585
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Yeah so we got all this

586
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
But

587
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,360
About halfway through the episode Carrie finally gets

588
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,152
To like what the bread-and-butter is

589
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
What you want

590
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,736
Spend most of her time talking about because Johnson

591
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Himself an expert in

592
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,296
Couple of top out now

593
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,880
I have one question that has to do with

594
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
What

595
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
You were talking about with regard to FEMA and where they're deploying and then I'd like I know we're going for lunch

596
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Time but I'd like

597
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,912
He also addressed the financial meltdown be

598
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,472
That was part of the are some subject list

599
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
Topics are two of the main things that Alex Jones covers on his show the eye

600
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,320
Coming Financial meltdown

601
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Former Intel agent

602
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Financial crisis

603
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
That's correct I too was a was trained by Edwards

604
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,736
Fraction

605
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,344
I'd love to have him confirm bedroom

606
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Fremont

607
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Exocentric

608
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
Go to Alex's.

609
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
We have this guy

610
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Supposed expert

611
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
Some variety

612
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,608
And here's what he has to say about

613
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
That's the thing I actually think

614
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
FEMA is more about

615
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
Populations that will be on the move

616
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,408
Riley Reid

617
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,944
I think they're kind of

618
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Let's say you got a

619
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
A bottle and everybody's down in the bottle and everybody has to go through the bottleneck to get out right

620
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,208
You're putting FEMA right there at the bottleneck

621
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,024
They're going to need help

622
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:19,168
They're getting ready

623
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
Emergency Management agency

624
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
Emergency response

625
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,224
Actually accurate

626
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Conception of the camp

627
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,696
Is there to cut off the flow of people

628
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Which is

629
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
You know just because they're not clearly specifying

630
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Became pastor

631
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,912
That is the exact same idea

632
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Evil female organization

633
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Operating

634
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
Because of these crises

635
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
That the Illuminati is going to

636
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Perpetuate

637
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
The solutions they already

638
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
Cutting off bottlenecking

639
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,416
Is my wife

640
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
My wild

641
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,608
No no I make perfect sense but I promise you there will be

642
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
As we get

643
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
Through this there will be you'll see

644
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,264
Crystal clearly why this is important

645
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
Can I ask you a question

646
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Why is not a doctor John Waterman

647
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
An expert on Fremont

648
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
Because he

649
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,504
He is a Former Intelligence

650
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
Is red a blogger

651
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
I don't know I don't think

652
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
He talks about like

653
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Sources he has

654
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,560
Anonymous Vegas

655
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
I got to listen to that

656
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,752
Yeah so we got that

657
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
FEMA camps.

658
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
And then the other subject

659
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Talk about was

660
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688
Meltdown of the economy

661
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
It's coming, and you know what

662
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,552
You can say that Carrie

663
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
Is just coming out of this

664
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
I don't know where but no

665
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
You should know that 10

666
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Carrie new

667
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
The financial collapse is coming

668
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
Right about when this episode.

669
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,168
Henry Deacon Overton around 10 years ago

670
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,472
Old Camelot

671
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
That

672
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:33,312
We were going to it wasn't going to be one set of

673
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
Circumstances that was going to happen in the future

674
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
And they and he even they even told us

675
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
2016 + 27

676
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,576
These are the years that we were told about

677
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
10 years ago

678
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,648
They said he said

679
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:53,024
That it was going to be a series of things that would all happen at the same time

680
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
So it's not

681
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,376
Major earthquake

682
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,960
And that's where I want to get into the financial talk now because

683
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,824
You do have some knowledge in that area and there's no doubt that we're having

684
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Or being hit

685
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,968
Financially and there is a plan a plan complete change in the system

686
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
That is supposed to have a deadline of the end of 2016

687
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
Camelot were told this by not just one with

688
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
What do you have to say about that part

689
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
What is

690
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,496
I'm going to meet myself

691
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,664
Where we can begin talking about this is that

692
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
The dollar

693
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,320
Has been recognized the US dollar

694
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
Economics

695
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Weapon

696
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,512
Economic weapon

697
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
Of War

698
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
So

699
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,632
It should surprise you not at all

700
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
To know that

701
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
His blog

702
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,032
On December 4th

703
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
2080

704
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Teeny posted

705
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
The Federal Reserve Act passed by three senators in a unanimous

706
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:22,624
23rd of December 19th

707
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Cool

708
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:30,048
Okay that's awesome

709
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Guys look

710
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
The waitresses

711
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
System is currently in

712
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,680
Instituted there will be another financial crash that's

713
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Literally how it works

714
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
It's now they change the rules

715
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
And they will not change

716
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,384
To ensure that every now and then there will be

717
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,064
This is predicting an earthquake in LA in order to

718
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
The closet collab product

719
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
People who

720
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Super duper rich

721
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
They don't feel the consequences.

722
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
So that's why they have no info

723
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
Change those rules back to red

724
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,752
There were protection

725
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,080
In place

726
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,224
Yeah please nonsense we've got this idea that he's putting forth it is

727
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
That you have

728
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,320
The dollar

729
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,344
Is

730
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Of some sort

731
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,952
Clearly believe it was set up in 1913 by the

732
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,864
Cesar menotti bankers

733
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,472
Right

734
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Precipitate of financial

735
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
Meltdown

736
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,872
Irresponsible by going with these dates

737
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
Pretending she's known for 10 years there's a deadline

738
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,064
26

739
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Do you were wrong for

740
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Subaru Outback

741
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:03,744
Even just a bad prediction all those horses you had were very wrong

742
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
Pizza Buffet

743
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
In his

744
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
It is decided

745
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Ideas that be

746
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Because of the fee

747
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
Fiat currency

748
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
The dollar

749
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
It's going to cause this

750
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,800
So it shouldn't surprise you at all

751
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
But he's also

752
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,432
Into hard currency

753
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,296
Is anything that is a threat to the dollar than is an enemy

754
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
The powers-that-be

755
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
That's it

756
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Bottom line

757
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Gold and silver

758
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,256
It's an enemy

759
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
So they controlled by

760
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Having

761
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,352
These

762
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,680
Training

763
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Worthy

764
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,032
Rothschild Illuminati of the world

765
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,128
Made sure that the value of gold stayed down

766
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,199
So the Rothschilds in the Illuminati were suppressing

767
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
The price of gold

768
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
Alex Jones

769
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,623
Gold constantly talk about Eva Global is the price of gold

770
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,439
So buy it now before it's Skyrocket

771
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,511
Gillette stuff and when the economy falls apart that price of gold

772
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
It's exactly the same

773
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Exactly the same

774
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
Hi I'm not a doctor John

775
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Suggesting that you buy

776
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,663
Please feel free to buy as many not a gold bars as you would like to buy from not a doctor

777
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,735
It is interesting message approved by

778
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Not anybody

779
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,831
I think it was a decent radio voice but outside of that I got like

780
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
Almost everything he seems I'm qualified to speak on

781
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
A lot like these

782
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Paranoid

783
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Conspiratorial

784
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Typed

785
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
Community people

786
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
The head of militia

787
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Where to go

788
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
But who knows

789
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
It was called the United States Army

790
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
It was called Dan

791
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,831
The world

792
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Cool

793
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
He has some other more specific

794
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Advice to give you

795
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,839
And so they opened up an exchange

796
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
The term for

797
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Federal Reserve money

798
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
What about the blood bank

799
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Sperm bank

800
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:28,383
Those are actually

801
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,711
The $250,000 worth

802
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
I know that

803
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:38,111
Utah

804
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
I think it's the only state

805
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
2011

806
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
They made it

807
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
Used gold and silver

808
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
In order to pay

809
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
For like God.

810
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Stuff like that

811
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
So that got changed and so there's a

812
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,703
There's like Exchange

813
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
In Utah around

814
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
Gold and silver market

815
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Get that is much

816
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Different than it is another state

817
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
That's what he's talking about

818
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
Central Fiat money

819
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:10,367
So they opened up this a group the first one that's open that I like is upma

820
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Hey that's abbreviation

821
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
Dot-org

822
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
If you go there

823
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,631
You'll see some videos of the Secretary of

824
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,447
The Attorney General

825
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Talking

826
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:30,591
You'll see a CEO that's running for governor by the way who runs Overstock

827
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Overstock.com

828
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,943
Almost no doubt in my mind that he

829
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
He's getting money from

830
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:40,319
BMI million-dollar the United precious metals Association

831
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,671
He later says he's not getting

832
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
Means.

833
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Getting paid by um

834
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,727
He has ads for them on his website

835
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Third

836
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
You hear the way he

837
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
Presented this is like the one that I really like

838
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Snn talks about

839
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Go to the website

840
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
General

841
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,319
Upma

842
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:17,951
It's all real credible stuff and you should go there you should go check it out

843
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
So we've now turned

844
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,511
The corner he right

845
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
When do the showare

846
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
You starting to spread fear about

847
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,935
You know fiat currency at a coming meltdown and stuff like that

848
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
But to anyone paying close attention

849
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,359
Are you only doing that because you have a financial interest in upma

850
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,759
Because it seems like you might he's running the game that Alex and good by himself

851
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,111
Really aware of it

852
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,903
This is exactly like

853
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Peter Schiff

854
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
It was on.

855
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
Do you want on and was talking about how great goal days and how

856
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
The markets unsecured and stuff like that

857
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:01,471
Peter Schiff

858
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Also

859
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,639
I want to plug my gold selling

860
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Also the way he said

861
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Upma

862
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
UPS

863
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
M

864
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Hey

865
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
.

866
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Org

867
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:22,463
Their website that is a man whose

868
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
Given a sales pitch of the path

869
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Featherman who's in natural path.

870
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,375
Because it feels I wiped

871
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
We get to see you like I think that this is almost

872
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,007
Exactly like how Alex does

873
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,567
Maybe not as bracing like maybe doesn't

874
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Take a turn off quickly

875
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:45,247
Is an insanely irresponsible level of fear-mongering

876
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
That

877
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
Precipitates and leads directly into

878
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Him bringing back up

879
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Upma in house

880
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
Coming up

881
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Through June

882
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
And July

883
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
You're going to see

884
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
Very bizarre stuff I believe

885
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,703
In our financial banking sector

886
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
I think you're going to see

887
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Some of the

888
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Big Banks

889
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,431
I think you're going to Vincy at the end of July

890
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
The beginning

891
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
Hyperinflation now I've got some numbers

892
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
You saw this

893
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:28,511
Late summer early fall

894
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Numbers

895
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,119
Go to the grocery store

896
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
On Monday

897
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
Buy groceries and when you go back

898
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,287
1 days. Of time

899
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,615
Your groceries are going to be 9% more

900
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,943
Kg to lb

901
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Meaning of weeks

902
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
75% increase in your food

903
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Have to choose

904
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,583
Do I pay my house payment for my car payment or do I

905
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,215
And this is where we're going and it's going to be starting late summer

906
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,567
She go to upma.org

907
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,639
You can kind of set you up and I hate to say it

908
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Bank account

909
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
But this is not a bank

910
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Okay

911
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,527
Dollars in there

912
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:30,207
Gold or silver whichever you want or combination

913
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
So it's basically a place where they buy the gold they hold it you have like a debit card where you can use the amount of the gold that you have

914
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:43,519
Huron gold

915
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,639
Put a nugget in there in there like this

916
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,711
Operations like that

917
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
In the golden silver

918
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Precious metal

919
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
Dismiss the idea of like they have

920
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,879
V until I got to hold it for you

921
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
Yeah but there is a lot of stuff like that

922
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
I think I understand a lot of it is kind of

923
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,071
Be careful it's all on the up-and-up

924
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,143
Abigail

925
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
You know

926
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:18,335
Clip and I can't hear any other way than a sales pitch.

927
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:27,551
You put $1,000 to get you to sign up for an account.

928
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Say you have $1,000 in

929
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
In United States dollar

930
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Gold

931
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
Where somebody else gets to hold on to it

932
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
And then they give you

933
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,263
A representation of

934
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,919
That you can use in the form of a car plastic not paper so it's not Fiat

935
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,503
Discard

936
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,319
Thank you for your fake name

937
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
I just

938
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,183
See like this is a scam

939
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,487
Run Ontario

940
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
He's abusing her platform

941
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
That's true

942
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,607
She wanted to talk about earthquakes

943
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
And maybe

944
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:20,543
Some stuff about financial trouble that you're out about 4.

945
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
Sister's going to

946
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
But it's clear that

947
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Steven chica

948
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,407
Until like in the mall

949
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,711
A little bit this is like

950
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,783
She doesn't get mad at him or anything like that like she doesn't

951
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
The cheese like

952
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
At least

953
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Suspicious

954
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Okay

955
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
Like there's a little bit

956
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,375
Cuz I'm I'm listening to it now

957
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,471
Like if I were casually listening I wouldn't

958
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,311
I've noticed that the very obvious

959
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
You know I would have but I my perfect

960
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,879
You are already in that world and you have no reason

961
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,695
Conn's on you all the time

962
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
Be passive

963
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
We listening to

964
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
I don't have a financial intra

965
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Tristan upma

966
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:28,383
But I know that you're right

967
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,919
So far you have been right about

968
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Seems like everything

969
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:36,319
And even write about it he's right about this next prediction that he makes I got to be honest I don't like to

970
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
To give it up till really

971
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
No

972
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,975
And they plan on running this country have a revolution in fact

973
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:47,327
I have a lot of information saying they were probably

974
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,703
The second American Revolution

975
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
So

976
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Could be playing

977
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,039
Introduces American revolution's coming around the Republic

978
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,343
Budget plan

979
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:20,863
I have a lot of secret people telling me all these things the revolution is coming

980
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Grape

981
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Didn't happen

982
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,775
Outlook

983
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Look

984
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,615
In a world where there's remote poisoners and remote Healers

985
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
I have group of remotes

986
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,807
Occasional Financial Times readers telling me

987
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
American Revolution

988
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
True

989
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,559
Play

990
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
When did the Republican Warren is in August

991
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,239
I think so I don't remember exactly

992
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Summer

993
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
And that's important

994
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
To talk about

995
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,991
I got information more information about the economy that got

996
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,367
Some very interesting more research about certain groups

997
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
Red flag

998
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
And what they're planning to do

999
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,791
With this kind of stuff like DNA

1000
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
It's been very enlightening even to me

1001
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
If you were going to say this is going to be a very hot summer politically hot

1002
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
Financially troubling hot

1003
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Every in every aspect

1004
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,623
Like you were saying it's not one thing it's multiple

1005
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
Summerville it December of Rage baby

1006
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
2016

1007
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Contested

1008
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:06,335
Presidential election happening politically hot

1009
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,407
Emotional

1010
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,807
No s*** man in the year of a presidential election how could it not be

1011
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,391
Notorious assholes

1012
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,975
Or like maybe one other summer of presidential

1013
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
Where there was a summer of Rage

1014
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
A lot of them probably what about what about

1015
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
2012

1016
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Sure

1017
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
How much is

1018
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Yep

1019
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
What about 2004

1020
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
Summer of Rage

1021
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
These people say

1022
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
Is what these mean it very specific

1023
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
American Revolution

1024
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
Going to kick off an acrimonious

1025
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
We're not going to have a great time

1026
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,719
Temperature going to rise

1027
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
Look at that is a zero

1028
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:01,887
Make it

1029
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,423
Be saying nothing

1030
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
When you say summer of Rage in this sense

1031
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
You mean it

1032
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
Any particular context

1033
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,383
You're only doing that service

1034
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
I'm trying to sell this

1035
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Some groups

1036
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
See

1037
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,271
No that's where we need to probably start having a copper

1038
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,343
Yeah

1039
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Some groups

1040
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
Not

1041
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
And suggest that I

1042
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,119
No. Seems like a bad guy

1043
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:39,519
So the red flag to me and where I was like

1044
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:44,639
Website the Waterman files

1045
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,991
Whatever issues you have buddies like fake credentials and stuff

1046
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,271
If you check out their websites

1047
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Problems jump out in Media

1048
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,367
From a blog post on December 28th

1049
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
2018

1050
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,023
Is WWII came to an end to purge the German race from the planet

1051
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:07,423
Zionist took over Germany called second Israel

1052
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,983
Niche

1053
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:16,383
Zionist agenda eversense

1054
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,479
Ever since the end of World War II

1055
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,783
Compounded the media are part of the mines

1056
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
The people with a German Nazi

1057
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
Propaganda

1058
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
So the German military

1059
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
They think it's a

1060
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,207
The fascist regime

1061
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
Here's the thing

1062
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,839
Waterman believes a lot of the same stuff as Alex does

1063
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Is bigotry

1064
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,751
Take this post from October 2020 Ryan

1065
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
Bistro that would better come out

1066
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,407
Quote Jewish Hollywood continues to lie by a plane hit the Pentagon

1067
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,015
Over and over like the live the so-called Holocaust

1068
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Analyze

1069
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
California criminal politician Adam Schiff

1070
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,183
The Jews will continue to support the anti-American attacks on America

1071
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
George Soros

1072
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
So he is an anti-semite

1073
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
Have something we can to find him even anti-semite

1074
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
Not a John Waters

1075
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:24,735
Explicitly arguing that he's trying to resurrect

1076
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
The Christian country in Russia

1077
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
Taking control away from

1078
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
Jewish Bolshevik

1079
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,623
Which is why the world hates

1080
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Tim so much

1081
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
It's all just a result of

1082
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
Do the Jews control the media

1083
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
And hating the fact

1084
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,375
The simultaneous the enemies

1085
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,935
Infinite and the enemy is always losing

1086
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,007
Conundrum that they always have or it's like

1087
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,335
All the Jews control everything and they're telling all of you

1088
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:55,455
But also the Jews are f***** over at every possible turn like

1089
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,783
I don't understand

1090
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
What are you doing

1091
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
What are you doing lyrics

1092
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
Vacation

1093
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,511
What Jews do their thing unless it is really which case

1094
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Different stuff

1095
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:16,959
It's because it's because it's so historically a part of our alexar

1096
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,567
Collective Consciousness is a piece of History

1097
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
Existed

1098
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,223
You go back you know when the blood libel started

1099
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,087
Wetware r1800

1100
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,159
Part of bike Pub

1101
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
Looks like you for a really long time

1102
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
And we've come to a place

1103
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,511
In our culture

1104
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
Especially

1105
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,071
The people know about the Holocaust

1106
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,143
Things like that but they don't realize a lot of

1107
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
Hatred was built on

1108
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
I don't understand a lot of the stuff

1109
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
Free dates

1110
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,823
Even the rise of Nazism why they chose

1111
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
Scapegoat

1112
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Among other skate

1113
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
People don't recognize

1114
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
Shortcut

1115
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
The people who are lazy and bad

1116
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
His maid

1117
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
Forever so people like a waterman

1118
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
He just doesn't want to do the work

1119
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
She doesn't want to

1120
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Understand

1121
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
These are

1122
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
Grapple with

1123
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,143
The greater complexity than one group of evil Zionist

1124
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,935
Right

1125
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
For me is this

1126
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:25,311
He believes almost exactly the same things as Alex

1127
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
You seen it over and over again throughout this episode

1128
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,919
And even post

1129
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,455
Bitter you know against

1130
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,783
Please things similar things to Alex

1131
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,879
In-N-Out f****** 100

1132
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Punch Adam Schiff

1133
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,255
He loves Putin because he thinks that he's resurrecting a Christian

1134
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
Country which is

1135
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,839
The Peace of Alex's rhetoric

1136
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
All of his stuff is there

1137
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
And also

1138
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
Fancy sandwiches

1139
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
And one of the reasons that I believe that this is

1140
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
It's because he

1141
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,943
He perpetuates the same narrative

1142
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
He's almost

1143
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,551
To back up his argument

1144
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,087
Zerohedge.com

1145
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
At least I did on his blog

1146
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
All the same

1147
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
Communist narrative

1148
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
Foundation

1149
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,327
Waterman is he's an unrepentant Day by semi

1150
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
Because he understands what

1151
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
The point of

1152
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
The propaganda is

1153
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
Even if some people try to be

1154
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Explicit about

1155
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
Alex Jones

1156
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Using

1157
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Anti-semitic propaganda

1158
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
Whether or not

1159
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,615
Stone up to the fact

1160
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
What's behind

1161
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
I'm someone like John Waters

1162
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Lake Asbury

1163
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
Clearly illustrate

1164
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,551
Yes

1165
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,623
Of the world's structure

1166
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
And what have you write exact same sources

1167
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
Historical trends

1168
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
That lead from the

1169
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
The past to him

1170
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
Lead right to Alex

1171
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
The only difference is that Alex

1172
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,911
Couches is rhetoric with

1173
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
It's not the Jews at

1174
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Hate it

1175
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Heat

1176
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,287
I'm part of humanity

1177
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,383
Stupid so that's all awful but just to make you feel a little better on a review

1178
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
Imma post that you made on Christmas Day

1179
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
28 trillion

1180
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,783
If you thought that your Christmas was kind of weird

1181
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Consider this

1182
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,207
One very good stores the personal friend spends a couple hours each day investigating to high-level Brinkman

1183
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,303
We've met in Costa Rica during a trip by this bright tireless person

1184
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
Is direct connection

1185
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,471
Certain qanon members who work closely with JFK Junior

1186
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
Bush family is in turmoil and Hillary's face charges with only the timing endowed

1187
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Not the process

1188
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:42,271
And most excitingly said John F Kennedy Junior will return to the stage at a grand event

1189
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:47,647
Jennifer his father's killer is George h.w. Bush

1190
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:55,071
You don't know that the party qanon

1191
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:59,935
Now the Trump is

1192
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
Is j.f.k. jr.

1193
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,783
Later

1194
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,439
The problem with ever really talking about qanon stuff if they have this

1195
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
Makes fun of

1196
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,327
Thank you and I'll be there like that stupid

1197
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,191
Stupid s*** there's a bunch

1198
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:32,959
It's just

1199
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,383
Waterman

1200
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
Diva qanon geyser

1201
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,991
Complete weirdo gleaves almost all the same stuff is Alex Jones or also

1202
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Anti-semite

1203
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:50,111
Gary

1204
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
She's trying to

1205
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Wind down

1206
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
The interview

1207
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
He's like I want to play you something that I made

1208
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
Not Bank

1209
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:08,287
I kind of thought that might be what are you doing I really had a hunch.

1210
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
Shoot the Moon

1211
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,943
But instead what it is is a long

1212
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Welding music

1213
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,503
Kind of

1214
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Islam

1215
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,111
There's some swelling music behind it and people saying

1216
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
You are.

1217
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:33,375
His little speech

1218
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
But he gives

1219
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
About how your

1220
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,079
We are in this together

1221
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
And I think that gives us hope

1222
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,671
I feel like he thinks he's taking over her show

1223
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:02,303
He's doing overnights now he's doing like your long overnight radio

1224
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
The most important thing

1225
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,119
We are not alone

1226
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679
You know cuz if we were alone

1227
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,799
Holland

1228
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,127
And we're not alone and there are many people

1229
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
Jerry

1230
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,807
This is the awake

1231
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,111
We just need to

1232
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Understand we're not bickering

1233
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
It's

1234
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
Not time for us to

1235
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,375
Shades of our color it's time for

1236
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:42,495
I want to get rid of the mess and you and I are on the same page

1237
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
You get this done and get it over

1238
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
So

1239
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:50,431
Knowing more about him that message is no longer inspirational

1240
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:57,087
If you don't know what he believes that that message could easily be heard as a message of unity the idea of it's not time

1241
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,511
Shade of our colors although that doesn't play there is a time to talk about that and I don't like that

1242
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:10,911
That could fault hit your ear the same way at Alex's we all bleed red blood at out early.

1243
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Purple blue red

1244
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Doesn't matter

1245
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,335
Bigger

1246
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,175
Evil that we need to face and that is this the system

1247
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,527
Or whatever

1248
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
This is a message of unity

1249
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,463
Unless you're Jewish

1250
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,583
We're going to f*** you up we're all in this together except these Jews

1251
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
It's crazy to me for us

1252
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
So many levels first of all

1253
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:47,007
The little bit of awareness about

1254
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
His worldview

1255
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,079
It brings into

1256
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Focused like that

1257
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
We change what he say

1258
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
I meant second

1259
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,735
He doesn't know anything about him

1260
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,551
She allows him to give this message

1261
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
A show

1262
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
That is an Aki with sounding

1263
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,695
What is actually deeply anti-Semitic

1264
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
Because even says remove the problem or get rid of this mess and just take care of it

1265
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Just get paid

1266
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:19,263
Done with it or something

1267
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,335
Figure out the Omega

1268
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,383
Fix for it

1269
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Figure out

1270
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
That one

1271
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,527
Problem solver

1272
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,319
To figure out

1273
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
Find lynels fedoras

1274
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,767
Weather because she kind of believe similar things

1275
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,559
Certainly heard her say

1276
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Not so wonderful

1277
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Cool things

1278
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Foot like

1279
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
Whether it's that or just because she has no idea

1280
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,031
She's talking to and dozen

1281
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,823
Prepare really for shows at all

1282
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
What she's done is allowed someone

1283
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,895
Slick enough

1284
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,431
To not make that a part of

1285
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,967
Is Public Presentation

1286
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,759
Be deeply Abby's Medical

1287
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Give a message

1288
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Attacks on her own show

1289
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Bridget

1290
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
Crazy to me

1291
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
Like what

1292
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Alicia Cara

1293
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
Better

1294
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
You can't do this

1295
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
You can

1296
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
If you care you can't do this

1297
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
It also proves you're not a

1298
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,167
Tango.com

1299
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Goddamn

1300
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Yeah it's just

1301
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
It's nuts to me

1302
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,359
Minut scale

1303
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,895
I think it's illustrative

1304
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
How

1305
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
People who have ill-will

1306
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,503
Not always just not

1307
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
But like people who have ill-will

1308
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
Like they're very adaptive

1309
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
It co-opting

1310
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
People's messages

1311
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,511
So you know you have somebody

1312
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,047
Like this Waterman

1313
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
You knows that if

1314
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
If you'd like

1315
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Immediately

1316
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
Hey Terry

1317
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Jacuzzi

1318
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Equal bad

1319
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,031
That's not going to be an interview.

1320
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
Not a doctor John Waterman in here that

1321
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
That's a strong state

1322
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Got to go

1323

1324
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,015
To know like a problem

1325

01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
Choose when I'm home

1328
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:17,279
When I'm on my way I can f****** say whatever I want

1329
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,351
Shitpost all day the only thing that I can

01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631

1331
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
The carries audio

1332
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Much larger than his

1333
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
And he knows this

1334
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Who's the best way

1335
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,263
Can hopefully.

1336
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,567
Over to his worldview

1337
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,103
By being on the show

1338
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Being careful

1339
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663

01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,575
This is how this shitt goes

1344
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
I don't know if I could

1345
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
I don't know how I would do that

1346
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
I'm not that far

1347
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
Hey

01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655

Everything where he is

1353
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,271
Whether consciously or unconsciously

1354
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,807
Tool by which

1355
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,135
People with ill-will attract

1356
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Themselves

1357
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,463
At Joe's expensive

1358
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
You shouldn't be

1359
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,767

The guys

1362
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
No

1363
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,727
You would hope

1364
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:34,847
You would you would hope that somebody who managed to help make Newsradio the f***

1365
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Greatest

1366
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
Sitcom of

1367
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
The 90s

1368
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
I would know better

1369
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
You would help

1370
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,503
Did somebody who has

1371
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,039
Dick was on that show

1372
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:47,135
Don't don't

1373
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
Place

1374
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
The murderer

1375
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:54,047
So this is a little Adventure

1376
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,095
I don't know if this is

1377
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
Hugely important

1378
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Discuss

1379
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
I think there's some connective tissue in there.

1380
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,543
Play important whether it be easy

1381
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Project Camelot world

1382
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
Connecting with h

1383
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,663
What's more realize there is

1384
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
There's a lot of connections

1385
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
The connection

1386
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,087
Between people who espouse exactly the same rhetoric is Alex

1387
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,111
But hide

1388
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
There are

1389
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Somatic nausea

1390
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
In order to be more socially accepted

1391
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,559
People like that you

1392
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,887
I always appreciate these

1393
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
Because there's so many

1394
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
I swear if you

1395
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
You were casual

1396
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
If you were not

1397
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Really

1398
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,567
You paying closer

1399
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,127
You didn't have

1400
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,919
Conversant in this world already

1401
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,455
You would listen to his

1402
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
Interview and be like

1403
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
How old is just a looney

1404
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:52,671
I know you're still no big deal I think that through most of it

1405
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
It is so much.

1406
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
You guys are always

1407
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Interconnected with

1408
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,303
And there's so many different

1409
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,583
Version there so many

1410
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Different flavors

1411
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Indigo

1412
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
These guys can get away with

1413
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
To a certain audio

1414
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,007
Somebody from Stormfront

1415
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
Maybelline

1416
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,079
The exact same s***

1417
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,359
As Alex Jones

1418
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
Of course

1419
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,687
Throwed off

1420
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
All this way

1421
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,271
Somebody on Facebook

1422
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
You like you know

1423
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,879
Who believes all the same s*** Alex Jones does

1424
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,927
Isn't going to stay at the same way that

1425
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
Stormfront

1426
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,791
Right

1427
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,815
Presentation

1428
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,351
But it's the same s***

1429
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,911
It's so hard because there's so many degrees

1430
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
To give people

1431
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
The benefit of the

1432
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,823
Yep

1433
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Has proven

1434
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
Is that you should never trust

1435
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
Anybody we're all in this

1436
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:51,039
And nobody knows what's going on

1437
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,367
And the summer of Rage

1438
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,927
The last thing I want to say

1439
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,791
I want to say is that like

1440
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
Just answer the funny wrinkle

1441
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:07,423
John Waterman

1442
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,311
Yeah you bet

1443
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,127
So what you have there to is another little

1444
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
Paracosm of these

1445
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,175
Halfsies

1446
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:18,943
These messages and all

1447
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
Credibility

1448
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,855
Themselves is attack

1449
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
People who are exactly like them

1450
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:30,463
You know in the same way if it's okay

1451
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Text Bill Cooper

1452
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Mexico

1453
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Does about him

1454
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
This John Waterman

1455
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
Attacks Alex Jones

1456
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Perversion

1457
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
Right

1458
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Stratford

1459
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:46,079
Write your own stuff like that that's another piece of this,

1460
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,223
Crye-Leike

1461
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,247
Only makes

1462
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,015
Both

1463
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
Party stronger

1464
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Which apps

1465
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,367
Infuriate like David Duke

1466
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Where you like

1467
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
Alex

1468
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,487
Stop pretending you love this guy

1469
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:07,583
Yeah you loved everything he stands for and you loved everything he believes but you

1470
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,167
Push back his followers can be like

1471
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,031
Alex

1472
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,103
He doesn't hate Jews but both of them

1473
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:24,223
You both keep both galvanized our audiences a little bit using the other person as their

1474
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,551
Hope to siphon

1475
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
How do you all go out for drinks

1476
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,815
The next episode but until then

1477
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
We got two apps

1478
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
We do have a website

1479
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,655
Dollartree.com

1480
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
Upp neurology

1481
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,007
.

1482
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
We also on Twitter

1483
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,663
We are on Facebook

1484
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,759
Like that

1485
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Dan

1486
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,367
I would guess

1487
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
Based on the fact that not a doctor John Waterman

1488
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,255
Is not a doctor Norwich on Waterman

1489
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:17,471
Some bad medical advice in the winter

1490
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
But one guy

1491
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Definite

1492
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Probably

1493
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Also

1494
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
Iteknic

1495
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,623
Alexandra Thurston color
