00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Find to the ridicule of all the Alligators

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
Something called knowledge first or knowledge fight people apparently

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
Loving date Alex Jones

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
Watch fight

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
A couple bottom-feeders who make their eating out

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
And so they have episodes almost

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
I guess I should say it

11
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,592
I got my ass kicked

12
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:26,528
Everybody

13
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928

14
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Jordan my bright spot is I was

15
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Podcast

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Needed someone to fill in

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
I imagine that would be a little bit more about Bray Wyatt

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Somebody talked about

19
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
I don't understand what the deal is with orange Cassidy

20
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
I mean if you don't know how to find podcasts that's kind of an interesting

21
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
How do you find us

22
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
Exactly

23
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Tell you to check out these New York City's losers Lake from LimeWire what's going on

24
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,856

Very beautiful person lovely love her very much

26
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
I found out

27
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,632
Recently that my shoes are garbage as they almost always are

28
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
Nice ceremony that I'm the fastest

29
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Tennis player maybe there's ever been right now

30
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,992
All sorts of things can be just a little bit

31
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
Just a little bit when you're running that's an excuse but also your feet are

32
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
I like goldfish and they will grow to the size of the container from what I remember

33
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:20,192
In basic biology when he's about a trait that is what they said about

34
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:26,592
These are different I don't want to screw up the good shoe sure sure one time

35
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
I got new shoes

36
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
Why you no like is there new

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
And I wore them to an open mic just because I don't like my older shoes at falling apart

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
I wore them and I walked in and immediately sorry Aunt Roxy and

39
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
John

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
John McBride there's like I forgot we're sitting at a table and they saw me and they just started doing

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,544
Run of jokes about my new shoes

42
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Halo

43
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
You don't get that it's just my favorite

44
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Yeah I couldn't stop laughing

45
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
Anyway Jordan today we have an episode to go over we're going to do some fun stuff but you might notice in the end

46
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
Throw their revenue special intro courtesy of DJ danarchy

47
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Stop that

48
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,935
Norm pattis lawyer extraordinaire premiere

49
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
Lawyers for cemented lawyers constitutional lawyers

50
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
For shitbags

51
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
Right he has a podcast called law and legitimacy and

52
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
After the trial he did a little bit of a breakdown

53
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
Battle of what happened

54
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,415
How he was wrong how the appeal is going to go great

55
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,255
Sure I'm and if you decided to bring us up and

56
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
What a terrible idea

57
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
But

58
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
That's the rule rule number one there

59
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,543
You just accidentally revealed a lot more than you wish.

60
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Quite a bit I think he mentioned us in a bankruptcy hearing recalled

61
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
Knowledge first

62
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Thought about

63
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
And I was just

64
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Good clean fun

65
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,695
This mention of us

66
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Is deeply problematic for Alex

67
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
And everybody at Infowars

68
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
You could hear the intro and feel like things are maybe taking a little bit out of context for the sake of the beat

69
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,311
USB clip of Norm talking about us on his podcast and afterwards

70
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
I think we'll have a lot to celebrate

71
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
And if there's one thing I've learned about Alex

72
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
It's that deserve these were video.

73
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
People love to hate

74
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
And so the haters

75
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
We had a field day

76
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
There's not there's no there there there's no real work

77
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
So they testified about what they do when they're in

78
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Cuz I don't know

79
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Good question really

80
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
And he would that be young man was able

81
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Persuade to trial judges

82
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
But this was Will

83
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Did the corporation had an obligation to

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Producer representative

85
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
Could answer

86
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
There had to be a

87
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
And so there was a

88
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Another deadline in

89
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
We selected iselect

90
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Connecticut because no one else

91
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
It info

92
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Was willing to do it

93
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,463
No one wanted to have their hair during deposition place.

94
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Video on

95
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Online

96
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
To the ridicule of all the Alex haters

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Because you know what

98
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
There are people

99
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
There's a

100
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
There's a

101
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
A website I learned about

102
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
Knowledge fight

103
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Haha

104
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
Bottom Feeders are art make

105
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
There

106
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
And so they have episodes almost

107
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Daily Mail

108
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
Call me out

109
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Call this one

110
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
I mean

111
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,927
Percentage of the royalties for the space events in there

112
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Haters didn't didn't want to

113
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
I'd be exposed

114
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm so the Connecticut representative

115
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Fight you didn't satisfy the

116
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Tire plug or the

117
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Judge

118
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
She testified in Connecticut

119
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Three and a half days

120
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
I called it the Gilligan's Island

121
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Direct

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
The guy had a

123
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Lawyer for the pie

124
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,039
Wait the Gilligan's Isle S3 our Tornai three-and-a-half day that doesn't make sense no

125
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
That's that's Norm stand-up chops,

126
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
So Norm

127
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,927
Come on man

128
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:31,327
You you're showing too much here early Brittany Paws got hired as the corporate representative because

129
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
Everyone else was worried about being roasted

130
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Okay

131
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,663
You know what day you kicked ass and you brought a lot of work into it but also the trials where the lawyers that are gray

132
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,551
A job you don't like your contribution was was spectacular but it was limited and it was shared

133
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
In this case

134
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Stan you cost Norm pattis personally

135
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
$30,000

136
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Maybe I am 600

137
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
OU yeah might be I mean like I don't want to break down quantifying things what is important

138
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
But there is a recognition here of a behavioral change that was made at Infowars which is prior to this robbed

139
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,527
Was totally fine going into being a Kangol hat wearing doofus

140
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
Did you do a couple I can't exactly man

141
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
He's afraid of me at all

142
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
To do this and face the kind of scrutiny in the public eye that are podcast RingCentral are words

143
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Only our podcast break right

144
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
And the other thing that it reveals to is that there are discussions

145
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
About us being a motivating factor and them not wanting to be the corporate

146
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
F****** hilarious memes this conversation happened

147
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
We need you to be the corporate rap again

148
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
I don't want to do it

149
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Those two guys will be mean to me those two guys at Chicago will just just

150
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,959
Roast the s*** out of me wow

151
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
Wow good luck royalties

152
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,223
He's really got to stop with this brain landlord joke

153
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Too much

154
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,343
In the aftermath of the trial too much like

155
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
I mean it's fun and all like for the first time I heard it

156
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Like

157
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:40,095
13

158
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,423
Like a hundred times

159
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
And I think that it's it's evidence of him either deflecting from reality or not understanding

160
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
What

161
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,663
I am this show is about

162
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
Yeah like I don't

163
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Give a s***

164
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
What is a

165
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
He is only

166
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,183
Serving the purposes of what I hope to achieve

167
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,047
Alex's nothing I have the sky and everything cool is out there

168
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
After we get through alley

169
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
But not after we get the relics in terms of play

170
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:21,311
Yo him going away the window there's there's

171
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,359
You see through the window

172
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
Yes I think it's hilarious

173
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Even funnier now that you it's too funny it's too funny thank you Norm

174
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
It's beyond a bright spot it's a revelation is it is because it is

175
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,679
Such it is such an acknowledgement of how much gaslighting they've been doing to us like

176
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,311
It's physically impossible for them not to know right we've known that for a long time

177
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,151
But what they knew how much they knew what it meant to them all that stuff

178
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
That we couldn't we could only

179
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Guess it.

180
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
We can only guess at any kind of drives you mad cuz you're like

181
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:08,671
There's no way they put that much thought into it I think that's partially because you and I are self-deprecating

182
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
People by Nature it's so it's like

183
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Get off your high horse these people don't care about you and cares about you and your head in Opera people

184
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Gaslighting yourself along with them

185
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,263
You think you're so important that they care about you is by is my thought process

186
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
That's why it was so shocking that like I'd heard that he mentioned us on the map

187
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
That's all I'd hurt

188
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,367
I had heard the rent-free thinks I was like to find out the second part

189
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,695
Is mind-boggling

190
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,839
It is a bad idea to insult somebody when they have a DJ willing to

191
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Remix that until 8

192
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,031
And if you were if you were in high school and there was a bully bothering you but you had a DJ was going to remix their insults

193
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
U14

194
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
If you

195
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
So little respect

196
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
Or the belief that whatever insult their saying is funny

197
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
No good no good

198
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,351
Wilford Snapple Snapple of the crippled people thank you so much

199
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:26,751
Wait I thought that was me

200
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Slumlord

201
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,039
Wait why did that one show up first in your brain

202
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,647
I don't know

203
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,791
Can we agree we boys

204
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
Lucy lolling on the trail thank you so much

205
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
Thank you very much

206
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,615
Never expected to learn that Alex Jones thinks our last name is weird we pronounce it

207
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Gil

208
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
The group of people is silent

209
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Journal about

210
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
Very much

211
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,135
Scribble kibble

212
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
You're so far behind sometimes you can really get it really tell

213
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
After the group triple triple

214
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
I'm a policy thank you

215
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
As you know we talked about this privately I've been having some insomnia type issues

216
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:45,087
The past week has been really tough with the sleep schedule

217
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
You know I think it has a little bit of an effect on you know what you want to do how much you can take on and

218
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,095
What have you checked and I found myself this week definitely having a like

219
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Turn on Alex's show

220
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
I didn't want to listen to it

221
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
It's frustrating I know I'm going to be bored

222
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
I'm already exhausted I don't really want to do this

223
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
And so I kind of

224
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,503
Do you know I can guess what he saying and I feel like I'm just not interested

225
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
And so I decided a norm

226
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,439
Talkingshit about discovering download

227
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
No

228
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
All these people are afraid to sit in a deposition room

229
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
Oh no we have another formulaic objection

230
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,847
Looking at is the deposition of Adan Salazar okay the

231
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
An editor people who wrote some of the articles that were Primary in the

232
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
Sandy Hook conspiracy right

233
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,927
Someone who has a female's around these Hindi hooked on versation

234
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Yeah somebody who followed us on Twitter until we mentioned it and then he unfollowed ran away

235
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
Distance from V Connecticut case and somebody who I've always had a little bit of

236
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Fascination with

237
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
Because I think he is a soldier

238
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
As they say in the

239
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
I don't know what world Gangland Warfare

240
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,039
Yeah.

241
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,927
He seems that he strikes me in the same way as someone like a Daria and that is like a all you believe

242
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
Or whether or not you believe you believe in whatever the underlying mission is going to follow orders

243
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
Regardless of whether or not they are sanctioned by the Geneva Convention

244
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:43,359
You know you are believing some insane thing

245
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,199
Are on distinguishable for you because

246
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
Whatever is motivating it is more important than its primary horrible s*** over

247
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,719
The course of his time he seems like an a******

248
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
I've never seen him in front of the camera

249
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Is not an on-camera guy that's true

250
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,959
Until I had nothing really to prepare me to do

251
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
To study literature like what's going to happen here

252
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
I was afraid of him anymore he doesn't strike me as

253
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:24,063
His intelligence is not of the world shaking variety

254
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Play might be a perfectly smart person but I don't find him and the way he answers questions

255
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,351
Processes what's going on to be all of that like remarkable

256
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
And that really bums me out

257
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
For some reason I thought he was like 26

258
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Or like

259
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
I don't know diddly Alex Darren mcbreen age range

260
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:56,063
Backstage that I was surprised to hear and I was disappointed

261
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
You know it's like I can kind of

262
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Whatever the

263
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Landmarks in life

264
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
They would have been fairly similar

265
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:10,911
We would have been the same age at about certain times row experience certain things world events

266
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
You know from the same

267
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Presumed

268
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Level of maturity

269
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Stanza that kind of makes me sad if he were on the front nine of life so to speak

270
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Instead of the back nine is where he start he started when you're going this is not going to end well for you man

271
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,951
The other thing too is there like I realize how delusional's I was of me because he's been there since 2012

272
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
So like

273
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
The idea that he would be 26 is like what he started at 16 to me and this is ridiculous

274
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
Writing he's at though you're not wrong

275
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,287
This deposition is quite interesting it's taken by Chris Maddie

276
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Let's just a jump in

277
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,015
How begins with some just formalities and stuff and the first question

278
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
The first bit that you want to get into is

279
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
How did you

280
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,439
Prepare for this deposition

281
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
That's a great way to open

282
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
And it always reveals that they didn't really tell that much

283
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
What did you do to her

284
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Fair for today's deposition mr. Salazar

285
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
I went over a few of the articles that are in question

286
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
Which articles

287
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Why did the

288
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
I reread the FBI's Sandy Hook

289
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Ibie says nobody died at Sandy Hook and

290
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Probably the

291
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
First

292
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
How big article that I wrote

293
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
The first what article probably

294
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Wolfgang halbig article whatever

295
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
Title

296
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
Something to the effect of

297
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Investigator

298
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Threatened

299
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Sandy Hook investigator friend something to that effect

300
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
That's it

301
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,895
Your beauty has two articles because of you anything else

302
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
But I didn't go in depth but I kind of just glossed over them

303
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
That's pretty much it

304
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Okay

305
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
Did you review any other

306
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
Materials in advance of your deposition today

307
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Other than

308
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Attorney Waldman

309
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Did you discuss

310
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
Your deposition with anybody else today

311
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
No sir

312
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
You haven't

313
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,055
Communicated with Alex Jones that you're being deposed

314
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
No sir

315
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
You haven't communicated that to David Jones

316
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
Ordinarily be working today

317
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
You're currently employed by whom

318
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
Free Speech systems infowars.com

319
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:48,863
As this deposition progresses you get the sense that maybe add-on should have done a little more to prepare for this interview

320
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
Basic elements of his timeline of his writing that Maddie can demonstrate Wichita

321
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Seems to think are like on discoverable secret very strange and probably difficult to believe

322
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
That add-on didn't talk to Alex or Rob do about being deposed

323
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
They work together this is in relation to a suit against Alex and the company and he was supposed to be

324
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
At work that day

325
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:18,815
It seems like he would have to come up with a reason he couldn't make it to work so I guess he was just lied to his employer

326
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,399
Right off the bat that doesn't Inspire confidence in him as a credible

327
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,959
Highlighting his willingness to deceive

328
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,311
Yeah I told my I told Anna to listen I didn't tell Alex her Owen or anyting

329
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
Cuz I told him my grandma died and I had to go to the funeral so that I'm a reliable source but the record shows

330
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:46,719
He was going to testify is that probably or possibly give the impression that Alex coached him

331
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,047
But I don't understand what issues are just telling Alex

332
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
But the existence of this deposition do know that they were interested in talking to idantity wrote These are

333
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,751
Articles that are involved in the suit

334
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:05,151
I could possibly see a scenario where a Don was afraid to tell Alex that he was actually going to show up and talk to the lawyers

335
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,479
Something like that I have a hard time accepting that this didn't come up

336
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Yeah possible but it's just like

337
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,367
It seems very weird. You okay

338
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
If I was going to be deposed for anything

339
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
And they had like

340
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
6

341
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Books I had to read

342
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,400
And I and I would be like okay I'm going to make it through at least a full two or three of these books right I got the

343
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
Time I've got the work there's that there's the the need to do it and then maybe I can pass off the other three as being

344
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
But

345
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,920
Adan is only telling me that he skimmed

346
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,528
Less than 5000 words right

347
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
Some of them maybe longer than you

348
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
You think but not that long

349
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:54,048
It seems really strange Mau if you really wanted to be an active participant

350
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
You would go to read the article you figure out like where the information that you were working from came from

351
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
At least brush up on some of that so you can

352
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,776
Defend your process

353
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
But yeah you just give him some stuff

354
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Yeah

355
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,920
So I don't started in April 2012

356
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,016
I am as we know the shooting happened in December 2012 so

357
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,344
Pretty new

358
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,184
But before we get to any of that we've talked about what he was doing before

359
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
April 2012

360
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
When did you go to start

361
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,792
For free speech systems

362
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
April 2012

363
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,472
Where we going to rain Friday night

364
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
I held three jobs

365
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
I rubbed vertex

366
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
Kroger.com

367
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,968
I also was a contractor for Quest Diagnostics

368
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
And

369
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
Was that their job

370
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Google search engine

371
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Optimizer

372
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
I work for a contractor

373
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Complete

374
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,360
It's somewhat notable that add-on began his time it in for his only a short time before Sandy Hook

375
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:17,760
Record he was a fresh new on-the-job reporter when the story started and as you can tell from this resume that done is given

376
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:23,648
He didn't have previous work experience they would make him well prepared for the role that he found himself a hoe.

377
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:30,048
The job quest is basically a courier position shuttling samples from hospitals and doctors office to essential testing for

378
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Facilitate

379
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:37,216
Textbroker is the sort of thing where he would get paid to write little blurb for website sort of a freelance

380
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
Big thing this is where you might go if you want someone to write a paragraph about yourself

381
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Much

382
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,552
Textbroker is also the sort of place you might go to get filler for a website that's designed for gaming affiliate link system

383
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,112
To give you some sense of the operation

384
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
In their basic category of services you can choose their low-rate option

385
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
Which has this blur but this is how it describes that service using their service

386
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:09,472
Quote I accept mistakes in spelling grammar and expression in favor of a lower price

387
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,848
For writing where you can just write

388
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,176
You can make about 1.1 cents per word for that

389
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
If you have to pay attention to spelling and grammar you can make up to about like 5.5 sensor work

390
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
Walking to hustle when there's no shame in this kind of gig necessarily the sort of work you do if you had ended

391
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Man skills in that field and it's something at

392
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,120
Maybe isn't a great thing to be like on the resume for

393
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:43,520
You know the job that he ends up in a line got paid 1.1 cents a word at one point but it is

394
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,920
The different is different currency why I don't think he's on the same level I don't think so

395
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:56,320
Money subtracted for punctuation

396
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Mama's

397
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,464
Leapforce is described here as an SEO subcontractor for Google

398
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:09,120
More specifically the company hires people to work at home and do repetitive searches to evaluate the results

399
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
Basically accuses information for better add play some

400
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,592
He's a pain in the ass kind of job and you can find tons of reviews about the grind and how it's really only worth doing as a side gig

401
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:22,688
Sportsmax for cash unless you could just turn off your brain

402
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,528
The people unlike Glassdoor talk about this is miserable

403
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,368
I mean no offense to add-on or anybody else working these kinds of jobs

404
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:36,512
It actually does show quite a bit of initiative for him to have these three gigs running simultaneously that's you know

405
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
Impressive

406
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
I just don't think it's a kind of resume Arby incredibly impressed by if I were running a super important media Network and I was looking to hire

407
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,544
A reporter editor of the news

408
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,872
Maybe you take a chance on this candidate you get lucky but

409
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:58,272
Adams writing a behavior pretty Central to the claims that Infowars with disseminating that just lost them a billion dollars so it does

410
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
Doesn't seem like this one worked out great

411
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,392
When I worked at the coupon place right

412
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,792
Testing coupons that was my whole job is I would go in there and I would test expired coupons I put the code into a web

413
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Website like Alexa

414
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,144
Can you buy and they be like no and I be like you're goddamn right now

415
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
That was my whole day

416
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Right yeah

417
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,288
At no point in time was I like okay now that I finish this

418
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:26,688
I'm going to go work for the Tribune as a cub reporter like that wasn't that that's not the jump

419
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
I'm not the features editor

420
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
Don will go on to describe like his role in mediately was

421
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,328
There was no oversight

422
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:49,728
It's going to it's going from couponcabin to being to right hand in the newspaper

423
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:55,616
Well people already make it up as you go along.

424
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
That's crazy it's not

425
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Sup best pract

426
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,600
So now we get to add-ons educational background

427
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
Educational background

428
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,768
I went to the University of Texas for about a year-and-a-half

429
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
Major in Liberal Arts

430
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,936
Took several English courses are

431
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
I also did half the semester

432
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
Austin Community College

433
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,968
I don't know why you even bring up that you did half a semester at a community college

434
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
It's just confusing and it sounds like you're saying that you signed up for some classes I need just didn't finish

435
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
Austin Community College's 16-week semesters but they also offer some courses that run 8 weeks so it's entirely possible

436
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,560
Bullheaded on is expressing that he finished some of those 8-week classes

437
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,144
But if that's the case you should have said I took a few classes at ACC

438
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:54,240
That makes me think that it's more likely that you signed up and then just didn't

439
00:27:54,496 --> 00:28:00,640
Also I don't know how it is at all universities but typically liberal arts isn't a major in

440
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
Category of Majors you wouldn't be a liberal arts major you'd be within the liberal arts

441
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
The early year that he

442
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Didn't finish maybe he hadn't chosen a specific made realize just taking the basic courses

443
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,560
Humanity

444
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Oh yeah that's fine

445
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Would like I don't think liberal arts as a major

446
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,008
When I was I didn't go to UT Austin Community College

447
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:31,104
For a while and I hated it so much that after the second week

448
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,504
I would drive there to avoid telling my parents that I wasn't going to school but I would sleep in the Paw

449
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Parking lot

450
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
In case they put like a LoJack on your car

451
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
Respectful I'm going to not go to their class and sleep

452
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Nearby

453
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
That's pretty good

454
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,376
I did not put that on many resume so I didn't put it on

455
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
You didn't when I hired you

456
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
Education in the academic environment as a whole but I do try to be as clear as possible

457
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,064
You can be a smart and capable as anyone who went to college without any higher education in many folks I know bear that out

458
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
Over here looking at you buddy hyper-competent people who never went to college and those people aren't for

459
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
Folks that I would look at it and say it should take some classes

460
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Because they're doing just fine

461
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
On the other hand if you don't have any formal education then find yourself as a highly-placed reporter at a propaganda Outlet Where You Are

462
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Argue The Grieving families are actors and

463
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:37,664
You're discussing your educational background in a deposition that about that shity work

464
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,016
I might think that your lack of training or familiarity with the field that you're in is a problem

465
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,576
If you would have taken some classes

466
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,416
Yeah perfectly blunt I don't think that any amount of classes would help too.

467
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
Nobody's Dumber anything just

468
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
I don't think that he's interested in doing the thing that he's doing well

469
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,448
Moral framework necessary to do what you're doing now

470
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
Then you're fine whether you're an expert at J school or not they're going to do what you're doing

471
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,456
The moment of Revelation about yourself as opposed to class

472
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:17,856
So by this point the deposition we have a sense of what add-ons resume would probably look like when he applied to be a writer and editor

473
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Infowars

474
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,280
He had some freelance style writing experience but beyond that if he credential he had no experience in media order

475
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,352
Journalism education in the field but he got hired anyway

476
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,680
It seems like it might be possibly a reason why

477
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
Why did you apply systems

478
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,712
I like the Alex Jones and

479
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
The message

480
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,064
Before you leave

481
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
Ever applied General systems you were

482
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
Symphony audience member correct

483
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
Yes

484
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
I just

485
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:02,656
You know everytime I learn more about how Infowars operates I'm like there's no way there's just no way

486
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,728
It's usually a contest the demands of working there

487
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,568
I guess that baby is four more the on-air folks

488
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,968
The razzle-dazzle of contacts

489
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
About writing

490
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
Cuz there's like no better there's no like oh here's good writing a bad writing you've just got the same

491
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,720
Infowars essay contest oh no

492
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,536
I think I was Advocates below rates

493
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Not worried about

494
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:36,704
Typos in spellings and character

495
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,032
Maddie asks what

496
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
About Infowars I really got check got you interested

497
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
You

498
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,200
Alex Jones

499
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
Show in the written consent

500
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Probably there

501
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,184
You know their refusal to believe that the narrative behind 911

502
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Expo motive

503
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,144
That the mainstream media had reported concerning 911

504
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
What was that question again

505
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
Were you suspicious

506
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Question

507
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
I know you're anticipating what I'm going to say but

508
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
Did you personally suspect

509
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,272
The narrative

510
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,880
That the mainstream media have reported concerning 911

511
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Yes I was suspicious

512
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,792
In 2012 11 years after 9/11

513
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:40,192
That's a motivating in a whenever he got interested in this work

514
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah so motivating factor

515
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,592
Suspicions about 9/11

516
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
What's your what's your

517
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
Career path like if it starts with

518
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,296
I thought 9/11 was an inside job and then the next step is

519
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
I'm the editor at infowars.com

520
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,512
Spezza career path I saw employment because I was impressed with these people refusing to believe

521
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,328
The 9/11

522
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
You know

523
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:14,496
Yeah I appreciate this Instinct on Maddie's part and that is to go from this

524
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,032
Suspicions about 9/11

525
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,312
Why

526
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Because

527
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,408
In a deposition setting that can lead to some interesting thing

528
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,480
In in what in particular were you suspicious of

529
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,088
I didn't think we were being told the full truth about

530
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
Embarrassed

531
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
Parts of that

532
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
Narrative

533
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Like

534
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,816
And can you go into a little bit more detail about

535
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:42,656
What you thought the gas were in what the reporting was

536
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
I could have supposed

537
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
I didn't think that the

538
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,640
Should have been able to take down the buildings

539
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
As they were taking down yeah

540
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Seem like a controlled demolition which is a

541
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,832
A lot of people still believe actually

542
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,488
Are you one of those probably the biggest one especially with Building 7 falling

543
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,096
You know collapsing controlled demolition Style with no blender

544
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
The biggest actors

545
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Indeed

546
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,288
The fact that you felt it was implausible

547
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,824
That the buildings would have

548
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Collapse the way they did

549
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
Cause you to suspect weather

550
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
The United States government was

551
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
Involved in some way in the attack

552
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Directions

553
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,024
Okay this is a really interesting Club because there's a couple of things happen

554
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
The first is really transparent which is how a conspiracy theorist answers a question

555
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
He was suspicious about 911 but it's a conspiracy he hasn't focused on in awhile so a lot

556
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,848
Foggy in his memory

557
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Three tries to give a vague not answer

558
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,224
Then ask for something more specific

559
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,064
I just got like it doesn't seem right in building 7 is his response

560
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
How to adjust pretty soft

561
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,952
The second thing is something that will become important later if some of Maddie's questions develop

562
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,512
This is something that add-on is suspicious about

563
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,888
He has some inconclusive things 2.2 that he can use to justify these suspicions

564
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
And based on having those suspicions

565
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,032
He just testified to Maddie that led him to suspect the US government

566
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
Was involved

567
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,872
This provides a clear example of add-on stop Prosser

568
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,456
That's where he's willing to take things that look weird and make him suspicious

569
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,040
And use them to build up baseless explanatory narrative

570
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:40,160
Hold on to this for later because it will become clear how relevant this is the matter

571
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,976
And how much of a mistake this was on add-ons part

572
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,304
In in reflection maybe it doesn't

573
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,704
You know lead to any direct consequences but if you're analyzing this and looking at the way he

574
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984
Describes

575
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
He's processing and and how he

576
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Interact with information he's very damning

577
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,528
And it will become clearer later

578
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,440
I do appreciate one thing about Infowars employees that will never not be hilarious to me is that

579
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
At some point

580
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
Doesn't the lawyer half

581
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
To go in and be like

582
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Before you answer the question

583
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,376
Look at me

584
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
To see whether or not I'm going to object

585
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
UK

586
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Unless it's some other kind of objection

587
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
Sympathies

588
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Real you slept

589
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
You can't tell you happy

590
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,672
I don't know or not answer you know your lawyer before your answer

591
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:51,072
Isn't that at that's what I would do

592
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,376
My answer is

593
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,448
So when Adam got hired he got some training

594
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,312
But it wasn't what you think

595
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:06,432
When you started it enforced in April 2012 did you receive any training of any car

596
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,088
Learn the back-end systems

597
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
Like WordPress

598
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Things of that nature

599
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
Accident Freeman basically involves

600
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
You know

601
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
Learning how to use the

602
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,448
Software programs that you were going to be using everyday as an employee correct

603
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
Did you receive any training concerning

604
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
The writing function of your job

605
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
Did you ever

606
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
Impression of Orem

607
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
Did I ever watch

608
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,344
Did you ever receive any training during your tenure

609
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
Free Speech systems concerning

610
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,184
The writing function of your

611
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,328
Never received any training during the course of your employment

612
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Concerning

613
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Investigator

614
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
Journalistic practice

615
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,776
Petri mewmore at like

616
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
A fast food restaurant

617
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,224
I worked at JCPenneys for a for a cup of coffee

618
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Hours long

619
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Think about like

620
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:24,256
The corporate culture the rules and like harassment

621
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,096
Maybe she had to sign something saying that you understood the rules of what

622
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,496
They told ya it it seems like there's a oversight

623
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:40,640
If you walked into any newspaper in the world and they didn't tell you first things first about the

624
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Be quote in house style

625
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
They were just like

626
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
Right away my dude

627
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
Also I would I would say that

628
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,344
Every single job

629
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
That I've ever had

630
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
At least the first like half a week maybe even the first week

631
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,864
You're working with somebody else

632
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
Just to do just to know exactly how to do your job

633
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Yeah

634
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:10,592
It's wild that does not seem to be the case here. Receive training

635
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,432
On-the-job Universe sensibly do it

636
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
You know like steak

637
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
They taught him how to post things on the internet

638
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
Screw weight WordPress

639
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Yeah

640
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,672
That was it you know what that it kind of makes me think of like some temp

641
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,072
Go do it I don't give a s*** I got out of work

642
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,144
What did he think that first six months

643
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Right

644
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
He had to have been walking around like

645
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:43,360
They know right they know I have no idea what I feel like they have to look at me and know maybe that's part of it

646
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:47,456
Test though psychopathic

647
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,808
There's no such thing as imposter syndrome cuz I'm the greatest

648
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
They also got no training about like

649
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,672
What news to cover

650
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
You understood

651
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
When you applied Infowars that you would be

652
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
Applying for a

653
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
Editor and writer position

654
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,424
When you first start it

655
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,728
It sounds like

656
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,312
One of the things that you needed to do with update news item

657
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,872
On the infowars.com website correct

658
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
What do you mean by update

659
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,016
Find use

660
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
Items and

661
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
Republished them on Infowars

662
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
When the link back to the original

663
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,632
Find news items that appeared Elsewhere on the internet

664
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
And then

665
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Put a link to that

666
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,288
News item on the infowars.com website

667
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Correct

668
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
And how would you determine

669
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,248
Which news items to highlight on the infowars.com webs

670
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
That was subject

671
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
Basically whatever I thought

672
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
Would be good on the website

673
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
Did you receive any guidance

674
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
Or training on that in any way

675
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
No

676
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
That's

677
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Wild

678
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
I mean

679
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
I don't words fail

680
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
I just don't know how

681
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
It's not like you have to think like that can't be true can't be true

682
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,040
The only place in the world where it could be true

683
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
Opening of a wework

684
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:35,488
You know like these are the only two scams where you can pull off having no clue what you're doing and just be like

685
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,984
I'm just straight-up quit so fast

686
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,384
This is a scam

687
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,455
This is trouble

688
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,831
Leaving aside anything about the ideology or anything about it

689
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
A business that runs like this like

690
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
I don't know if

691
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,535
Payroll works like this but what are we doing

692
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,119
That is the roommate scam I'd like that and if I

693
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
Was interviewing for that job I would do it the same way as the roommate scam you know where it's like we're some selenite

694
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
I've got a move in with you and be your roommate but I need $2,000 upfront to move here and then I'll give you two

695
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,039
Dollars whenever wherever whatever it is you do

696
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
I'm somebody

697
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,183
But it is it is the job coronavirus like hey man come on

698
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:43,583
No I don't believe you for a f****** second trying to make me the CEO and then blame me

699
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,127
Also I don didn't need to get anybody sign off on posting things

700
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,687
A posting

701
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
News item

702
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,223
That you had

703
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
Eclipse from other sources

704
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,319
Did you have to get approval from anybody to ask

705
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Republic

706
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,303
It probably and it was like thanks

707
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
A little less

708
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,447
It was more loose back in 2012 and now we learned our lessons and work

709
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Kind of strict about Willie republish

710
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,823
I know ask you some questions about that but it's

711
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
The time you started

712
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
You could go to any

713
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Website

714
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,247
Select a news item that

715
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
You thought your audience might be interested in

716
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
And publish it to infowars.com

717
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Wild

718
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:45,279
So the we've learned our lessons you think that's about like

719
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
My contact like Sandy Hook stuff

720
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
But it's not

721
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
It's a l

722
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
Clip that I didn't cut

723
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
That

724
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
Basically there are some websites

725
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,407
That are litigious about rejecting preparing their content

726
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,247
Basically by trial-and-error you learned that like

727
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:11,647
The AP doesn't like it when you just steal their articles articles

728
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
Right right here

729
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,559
Sad like in terms of the lessons you've learned

730
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,959
Respecting intellectual property I guess I'll be right 80s it is analogous to learning

731
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:30,847
About which dumpsters are good to get food from you know there's there's definitely certainly something along those lines

732
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,943
They are nothing if not a raccoon

733
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,527
We info scavenge

734
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
So

735
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:46,207
I think that if you're in a position like a Don believe it or not put on the

736
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,815
Front facing facade reporting facts

737
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,887
You're doing factual reporting

738
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Do you consider yourself

739
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,287
To be reporting fax or do you consider yourself to be

740
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
You know writing your opinion

741
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
How do you

742
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Consider the type of writing you're doing

743
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Direction to Forum

744
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:13,599
I believe it's probably

745
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:20,511
You ride the fax with a maybe like a right-leaning slant instead of the left-leaning slant the mainstream media

746
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,631
Correctly

747
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
In your right hand

748
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
You are

749
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,799
Reporting facts but you the extent there's any sort of

750
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,127
Editorializing of those facts

751
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
You put a

752
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Right-leaning

753
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Slant on them

754
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Yes send it

755
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
Usually yes I think so

756
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
You know that you're already home

757
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Use

758
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Add to the write-up

759
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Political Spectrum

760
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
My audience and me

761
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
I mean

762
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Yes

763
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,607
Resume writing

764
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,191
You know left-wing manifestos

765
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,239
Your audience wonder what the heck happened right

766
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Right yeah

767
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,383
I think the journalistic outfits like they pee and stuff.

768
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
Pretend to be objective

769
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
But they're not

770
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,015
And we don't pretend to be objective

771
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
I'm sorry what

772
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:21,439
When you say you should only be a ejected I assume you don't need it

773
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,279
You are bias on our sleeves sorry

774
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,679
Not really no absolutely not Alex's entire brain disease above the left-right paradigm

775
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:37,567
Right-leaning slant of this is absolutely a betrayal of the central premise of Infowars

776
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Yeah but also quite obvious

777
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:46,015
Not regulatory embarrassing that add-on would phrase it this way and I

778
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
Underoath setting

779
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Because

780
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Alex probably disagree

781
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
Yeah I mean

782
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
I'm not really willing

783
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,815
About the hard part about these depositions is I always feel like we should really really you know no matter how base

784
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
Pick a concept you think you're dealing with

785
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
You need to go

786
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
Further and further down you know like just

787
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
What do you think of journalists

788
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:12,895
Does well they tried to do that with that didn't go well

789
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,967
To be fair I think you could probably

790
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,295
Find some fertile ground in there right but

791
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
This is already 4 hours long

792
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
The deposition that stroke-like first principles at the basic core concept

793
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,887
We like to get down to the very mitigating and be like let's go with a glossary of words my man what do you think

794
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,543
There's nobody in the world who would love if like every one of these depositions with a Ken Burns.

795
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:50,527
Do it other humans have other things

796
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,599
They're good

797
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
When you are

798
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Reporting facts your audience

799
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,815
I take it that it is important for you to accurately report what those facts are correct

800
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
And when you're writing about

801
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
A particular topic

802
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
What do you do

803
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
To educate yourself about the topic

804
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,359
And the fact that you're going to convey

805
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,479
I do research pretty-much read

806
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
Everything I can before I jump into a

807
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
An article

808
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
Sources of

809
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,743
Information come from that you read

810
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,191
Google search on Google News and also will look back at anything that Infowars has written

811
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,287
And maybe look at a YouTube video or to try to find

812
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Yeah I look at various different

813
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
Data points to try to

814
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
Formulate

815
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
Facts and opinions on the

816
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Subject

817
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:58,879
When you are doing research for case you're writing

818
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
You

819
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
AR

820
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
Doing that research exclusively from internet source is correct

821
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,351
Including a warzone

822
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
Previous material

823
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,655
Yes

824
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,191
That's not

825
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
It doesn't Inspire confidence

826
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Wow am I research methods are Googling Infowars articles count past and maybe some

827
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
Haha yeah

828
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Yeah

829
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
I mean

830
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
If you weren't

831
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
If

832
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
This is the dream

833
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,975
You know like he's having the dream isn't that what he's doing well it's either

834
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,767
He doesn't have to do anything

835
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:43,167
But occasionally Google stuff and then steal it I imagine there is a lot of like

836
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,263
You got to get this out fast because I'm going to be interesting to people in

837
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,663
6 hours hectic frustrating schedule email

838
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
Did you see this did you need that I also don't know how much you getting paid cuz that doesn't come

839
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
So it could also be 1.1 sent to work maybe this isn't such a good gig

840
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,071
Has much as some of the other Infowars employee of that

841
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,119
Get the f*** out of here

842
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,495
Yeah I wouldn't go back to Google analytics either or whatever it was

843
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:24,383
Also he didn't even read the 5000 words that he needed to read for this

844
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:30,783
Deposition what conference is that give you that he actually does any f****** research

845
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,391
You need to take that very seriously everything I can on

846
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
Google Maps

847
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
Matador now

848
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Right

849
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Sort of

850
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Not really

851
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
You're the cop.

852
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,631
Published

853
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,239
I send my work to

854
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Editor Jamie B

855
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
If he's not there I'll just

856
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,759
I reread I'll re-read my own working

857
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Is

858
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
Whatever Jamie why is available he reviews your work

859
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Yes

860
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,559
And for what purposes

861
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Typos

862
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
Pretty much zhiend make sure I got my

863
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
Byzantine cross

864
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
Yeah or are words and stuff yes exactly

865
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,991
He's essentially just proofreading

866
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Correct

867
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,343
He's not checking

868
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
For the accuracy of what you Britt

869
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
Technically now

870
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,631
Give me cleaner

871
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:55,007
They have like a whole conversation about whether or not anybody has ever done that it is time at Infowars

872
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
And he mentions only one person has this guy Mikhail Salen isn't with the company anymore

873
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,247
Now writes for the daily. I don't know what the f*** is deal is but you

874
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,575
Managed to transition out of the Infowars stink

875
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
Into

876
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:15,487
Something somewhat legitimate he's actually waiting somewhere

877
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:21,119
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know what his deal is but he was there apparently

878
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
When he was there

879
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:29,311
He would point out things like they got fired

880
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
Adan

881
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
Doesn't understand

882
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Like that action

883
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:41,599
Experiences it as like oh he was just doing that because he wanted to like it was just

884
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
He's just kind of fun for Mikhail you know we were having a little game between us I would lie and he

885
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
Be like you can't do this and I would be like hahaha I've been posted strong sense that he didn't listen to

886
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,751
So he can just buy whatever he wants

887
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,079
And apparently has never been told not to write something

888
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,919
Have you ever been instructed that you couldn't write about a particular topic

889
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
No

890
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,039
Have you ever had a request to publish an article

891
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Come down

892
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,159
No I don't think so

893
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,559
This is directly contradictory to Alex's Tire thing about how he told people not to write about them.

894
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
Amethyst

895
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,863
So that's

896
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Because that

897
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:31,263
I believe that that email from Paul

898
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,335
Tattoo

899
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,943
Mentioned something about this

900
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
I am so

901
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
He would be

902
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
The person

903
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,623
Who was told don't write about this be the only person

904
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
Someone has their picture wrong

905
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Oh that's not good

906
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
So I don't know how you would picture the

907
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,583
The workplace environment it Infowars the kind of like

908
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
Coworker

909
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
I just

910
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
After I find out the

911
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
Nobody's here at the like

912
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:05,567
Desert Dawn Salazar even live in the country like I did lose in Austin

913
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
Right but I mean there's no way to know

914
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:14,015
Based on what he's describing of his job but he could be in f****** South America right now and I've nobody would have anything for

915
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,575
I think that's probably part of wise like

916
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,951
It's so easy for Paul to have work there it is time living in England

917
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,863
And I'm this bums me out

918
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,911
During the

919
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,447
Course of your employment at

920
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
Infowars

921
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Has

922
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
War

923
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,359
Contact level with mr. Jones changed at all

924
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
No

925
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
How often are you in

926
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Communication with mr. Jones

927
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
In communication I would say maybe

928
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,719
Opossum going to the bathroom or something say hi so

929
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
Once a week or something

930
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:02,399
How often are you in communication to him about the substance of your work enforce

931
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
7-Eleven

932
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,799
This is bizarre living the dream no boss

933
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,407
I mean

934
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,807
He's worked there for a deck

935
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
Oh my God

936
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,975
It's inconceivable

937
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,071
I don't believe that if that is true

938
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
So rude totally

939
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
Totally

940
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,823
There aren't that many people who work there know how do you ignore one that close to you now that's bananas

941
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:48,223
Somebody who's responsible for holding so much of the content that you used to lie on air

942
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,527
It's it's like that is

943
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,599
Impersonal to the point of being hostile

944
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:59,999
Yeah absolutely no experience at except as

945
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:06,399
Is being iced out or something I come in there 10 years and it would feel like I know Alex is clearly trying to get rid

946
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
Native made

947
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
Wow just never happens

948
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,615
I guess just wait until someone notices your

949
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:21,247
I go back to the forensic financial analyst and he's like

950
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:27,391
A competently run business should have this to this amount of money and when you hear s*** like this you're like

951
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:33,791
Either they've got an absurd amount of money hidden in Gold somewhere because they are hiding it from everyone

952
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,119
Or this place just doesn't even know where money comes from

953
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,143
Languages go

954
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,031
Yeah they do have a very serious distrust of fiat currency

955
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
Yeah I don't know it's weird weird picture and it would be like Wonka

956
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
Factory Montana

957
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,527
Everyone's running around like

958
00:56:54,783 --> 00:57:00,927
Calling costumes I'd like to you when do you see Alex well occasional

959
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:07,327
He called the entire staff out we have to put on our elf costumes and we have to do a little dance for him

960
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:13,471
I mean that question wasn't asked could we what happened a little dance a dance

961
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
You never know

962
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:19,359
Get to Sandy Hook coming up and

963
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,431
The question that supposed is when did you

964
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
Find out about the shooting

965
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,319
Do you recall how you first learned

966
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
About

967
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,671
The Sandy Hook

968
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Shooting

969
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,559
I believe I was at work when it happened so

970
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
It was kind of playing

971
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
Everywhere one CNN

972
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
The breakroom

973
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,263
Then it was everywhere on the internet

974
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
Give me your job as a writer I take it back

975
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
You started following

976
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,687
That covered very closely as soon as it broke

977
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Yes

978
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
And

979
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,783
You knew immediately that

980
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,599
The Sandy Hook shooting was going to be a subjective Infowars

981
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Report incorrect

982
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,927
I didn't know that immediately no

983
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:11,839
If you weren't able to meet Lee to Intuit that this was going to be a major news story that Infowars was going to cover

984
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,119
Injection

985
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
No I didn't

986
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,447
Immediately realize that now

987
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,031
Days after NFL

988
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
What am I

989
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
So

990
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,943
But that time like two days after the event happened I was like okay

991
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
What's the big news event

992
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:35,647
Now this is something to keep an eye on here because adonnas testifying that like in this first month he was unaware of an inch

993
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
The cover the shooting

994
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
At Sandy Hook as that being fake

995
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,279
I am that timeline is going to be in trouble

996
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,583
Yeah as information is revealed

997
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,983
Yeah yeah yeah response that is I think the very appropriate like it's very bizarre

998
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,287
Imagine that you could see the shooting happen

999
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
You working in 40 how they've covered shootings in the past

1000
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
You were there for Aurora which just happen

1001
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,711
The job pretty recently

1002
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:04,063
I am in like a couple days later you realize oh this is a big story what

1003
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,903
I I mean either he's lying or he's insane

1004
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:12,255
Like there's no other explanation get the lying or just trying to

1005
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,303
Give a softer

1006
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
Appearance to say we weren't taking this as seriously as we could or May

1007
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
Maybe thought we would have something along those lines but there's no way the impression that you're like seeing this and get

1008
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,503
Excited for the coverage they are going to understand how that isn't the perception you would want to give like

1009
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:37,343
Saw this and immediately knew this is going to lead the news

1010
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Okay

1011
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Find

1012
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:45,535
Wow whatever this problem I would even be like it was a few hours

1013
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,095
Afterwards when I realized it was going to be

1014
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
What it was

1015
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,423
A couple of days makes you sound like you're

1016
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,775
Hiding underneath rocks

1017
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
You'd say then

1018
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,663
About two days after the Avengers when you first realized that

1019
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
You would be

1020
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,735
Writing about Sandy. Correct

1021
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
I didn't think I'd be writing about it yet

1022
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,159
I was looking at a

1023
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,975
Different banana leaves and stems and really like

1024
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,559
Put my foot down that I'd be writing about it yet so I think the whole

1025
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,375
First time I did was when I heard the interview

1026
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
Which was I don't think it was immediately after the shooting

1027
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,311
No it was in 2014

1028
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:35,455
So there was a interview that how big did not talk about that a little more later alright with the American free press

1029
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,015
And that was in like February

1030
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
I think

1031
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Banquet February maybe not

1032
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:46,719
December 14th two days to years same same difference

1033
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:52,863
Wrote an article about Wolfgang's interview and that is true

1034
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,143
Amount of time

1035
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
Is

1036
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
Like that

1037
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
If you're pitching that is your timeline

1038
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,871
Until 2014 I didn't know it was going to be writing about this traffic is a big story

1039
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
What is

1040
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:11,295
Outrageous and you don't want this to be like the 3rd of the foundation that you're laying

1041
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:17,183
Yeah terms of explaining what happened in a deposition set directly contradict yourself

1042
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:23,583
You know that Authority experiment where you know they've got somebody in the doctor's like press the button and it'll grow

1043
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:31,263
Like this is one of the few situations or if you did that experience here is that experiment here it'd be like 45 minute

1044
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
That's Max

1045
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:38,431
Press the button every time he lies in bed

1046
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,271
Listen I think I know how electricity works buddy

1047
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:46,111
I mean look I don't know any I don't know

1048
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,183
I don't know if that's one of those experiments that has been debunked

1049
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:55,583
I'm not sure I know the prison experiment

1050
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,959
There is such a frustrating

1051
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
Wade

1052
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,287
Path that this goes down

1053
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Like it is

1054
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
Like a Don is

1055
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,919
Such a bad stonewaller

1056
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
There is

1057
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,783
I will get to it and it's so frustrating

1058
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,855
What you need to know for now is that after the shooting

1059
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
Thought it was real

1060
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
I'm just trying to understand

1061
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
You know in the immediate aftermath

1062
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,535
What your

1063
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:35,519
Obviously in the immediate aftermath my perspective was a school shooting happen

1064
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,335
So I was

1065
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,151
On board with the shooting

1066
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
When you say I'm bored

1067
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,807
In the immediate aftermath what's and let's try and time this out

1068
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,623
Within two days of the shooting

1069
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
It was your own View

1070
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
At that time

1071
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
That

1072
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,791
Children and Educators were killed at Sandy Hook correct

1073
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,631
I would have phrased that differently but yeah

1074
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:06,751
I was what it is this shooting

1075
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:12,127
Maddie almost even gave him a chance to rephrase it

1076
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:19,551
His perspective on this is like he was only going to report on Sandy Hook if there were anomalies

1077
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
I take it from your testimony earlier that

1078
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,183
You anticipated that you would likely only write about it

1079
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
To the extent

1080
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
You

1081
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,351
Thought that there were anomalies associated with the shooting

1082
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,887
Worth writing about right

1083
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,287
Something that I found interesting and I thought

1084
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,847
Would I find interesting in

1085
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
Eventually happy

1086
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,455
Correct where you felt

1087
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
That

1088
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
You wanted to report

1089
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,087
On anomalies around Sandy Hook

1090
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,391
Because you found them interesting and you thought the audience

1091
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Yes yes

1092
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,535
So we come to this idea of anomaly

1093
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:07,423
And it's one of the words that Alex uses to sort of rationalize a lot of his coverage

1094
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
Kind of a vague term

1095
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,543
There isn't really a concrete definition of it

1096
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:19,199
And so in order to move forward we try to get a definition of what is an anomaly

1097
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,271
We're talkin about anomalies I just want to go back

1098
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
Can can you give me your definition of anomaly

1099
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,719
Let me something that doesn't really jive with the story

1100
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,935
So some fact that you believe exists that calls into question

1101
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,263
Other facts surrounding the shooting correct

1102
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Jackson

1103
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:52,991
Odd

1104
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:59,135
That you really don't know what it's the what it is what it's purposes like I said until you have more pieces

1105
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
Geico

1106
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
In considering

1107
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
Those anomalies

1108
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,815
When it came time to report on them

1109
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
I take it that it was

1110
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
Important to you

1111
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:16,287
For anything you published concerning Sandy Hook to be true and accurate correct

1112
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
Yes

1113
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
The best of my knowledge

1114
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,151
Right in

1115
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,431
You'd agree with me that

1116
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
The shooting of

1117
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,783
Twenty children and six Educators is a

1118
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
Horrible

1119
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,087
Correct

1120
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,671
And so if you're going to be reporting

1121
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,439
Facts

1122
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
About that

1123
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
Situation

1124
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,815
It's incredibly important to you that they be accurate

1125
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Correct

1126
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,679
And your audience relies on you

1127
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,263
To provide them with truthful and accurate information correct

1128
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Yessir

1129
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,335
And you understood at the time

1130
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
Of the Sandy Hook shooting

1131
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
And your coverage

1132
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,735
Of that shooting that Infowars audience

1133
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,319
Included millions of people across different platforms correct

1134
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
And so

1135
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,999
You considered it a tremendous responsibility of yours

1136
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,839
To make sure that they were well and accurately informed correct

1137
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Rejection

1138
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,191
Yes I would say so

1139
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
You take that responsibility seriously don't you

1140
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
It was important to you

1141
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,711
That the sources of information you had concerning

1142
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
Sandy Hook

1143
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
Be credible

1144
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Correct

1145
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
Yes

1146
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,135
Adan has repeatedly now

1147
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:41,279
Said yes I take this very seriously to me today

1148
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:47,935
Definition of anomaly but at least it's something you can kind of work with

1149
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,775
Alright I was surprised that the lawyer objected to Maddie

1150
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
Really doing a really good job of rephrasing

1151
01:06:55,103 --> 01:07:01,247
Anomaly is something that doesn't jive with the story

1152
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:07,647
Appreciators dictionary anomalies doesn't jive

1153
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Like the way this man thing

1154
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,231
Got it

1155
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,583
Later

1156
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:20,191
He said he's happy he smokes a jazz cigarette in between

1157
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:26,591
So there's a phenomenon called motivated reasoning

1158
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
Create an argument

1159
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,223
For something based on a conclusion that you already had you go looking for information

1160
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:37,855
Check new scam to confirmation bias inclusion they were going to have already

1161
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Now

1162
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:46,047
This conversation here with Don and how he was approaching

1163
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,423
Shooting if some of the Hallmarks of that okay

1164
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
Any

1165
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:57,567
Immediate aftermath and I'm talking about when I say immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting

1166
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
Let's talk about

1167
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
Okay so

1168
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
December

1169
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,343
14 2012 to January 14th 2013 with me

1170
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
Enduring that.

1171
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
Did you develop a concern

1172
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
That

1173
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,791
The shooting at Sandy Hook

1174
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
I could be used as a pretext

1175
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
4

1176
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
Gun confiscation

1177
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
Legislation

1178
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
I'm not sure if it was

1179
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
Specifically done

1180
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
Confiscation butt

1181
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,943
Yeah I was going to be able to check her tail gun rights

1182
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
I believe

1183
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,551
That was a concern you develop Within

1184
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,111
The month after the shooting that the

1185
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:46,207
Back to the shooting could be used as a pretext for curtailing gun rights correct

1186
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
Yes

1187
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,911
It was a concern to your knowledge that Alex Jones fear

1188
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,775
I believe so maybe if you go back and see some of the

1189
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
The incident

1190
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,127
Alex

1191
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Mentioning that concern

1192
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
I can't recall that it was a

1193
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,271
Concern

1194
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
It might have been

1195
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,623
Was that a principal reason

1196
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,671
That it was important to you

1197
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
2

1198
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Question

1199
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,071
Whether or not the shooting in fact occur

1200
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,631
Yeah that was one of them

1201
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,679
One of several reasons yeah

1202
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
What were some of the others

1203
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,823
Just trying to keep the media honest and

1204
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
You know trying to

1205
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,175
Sharethrough actual news

1206
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
Not fake news

1207
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
Shocking admission

1208
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
Understand

1209
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,207
Howard on wouldn't recognize what he just said

1210
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:57,375
He said the principally one of the reasons it was important for him to question whether or not Sandy Hook happened was because he was

1211
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,423
I was worried they were going to use it to take guns

1212
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,543
Right nothing to do with the reality or falsity of an event

1213
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
What is a

1214
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
Bucked up

1215
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,151
Thought process

1216
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
So here's what I thought

1217
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,783
Okay I thought that people would exploit this tragedy to pass

1218
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,831
Gun grabbing legislation

1219
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,231
I went out and I looked for the truth you know and everybody you said that it wasn't

1220
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
I called

1221
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,327
What's fake news and everybody said that it was I called Trunews

1222
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,399
So obviously it's true my man

1223
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,471
Thinking about it this way

1224
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:39,871
That you know you're worried about them exploiting this tragedy in order to push a political goal that you are a

1225
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Supposed to write

1226
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:46,527
Instead of supporting the political point that you are in favor of right

1227
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,623
Engaging in the argument about it we're in people are like a

1228
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
There's this cool shooting

1229
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:58,303
We should probably get better gun regulations and relays and common-sense reform

1230
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
No I don't believe that that is an appropriate thing to do and here are the reasons why

1231
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,287
They wouldn't have any argument is a shooting didn't happen

1232
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,335
So maybe I should try and prove that

1233
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
Insist that

1234
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,503
Because that's a shortcut that I don't have to make my argument by

1235
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
Right I meant

1236
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,111
Basically the way you could interpret what add-on is saying

1237
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
And obviously

1238
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,951
On some level I

1239
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
I'm fully aware that this is part of it

1240
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,839
Sort of ideological and information model

1241
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,375
Yeah but to hear it.

1242
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,447
Not trying to mask that in some way

1243
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,495
Is very shocking and it's

1244
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:42,079
It strikes me as somebody who doesn't realize what he's saying yeah

1245
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,895
How do you say it out loud

1246
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:51,295
Cuz you hear it then you'd hear it spoken into the world that you know maybe he's got one of those his lawyer didn't just like

1247
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,743
That's if that's a revelatory thing I do lawyers

1248
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,791
Color for these people like that is

1249
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,583
An insane thing to say

1250
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
How can you say that out loud and not be like

1251
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,983
Oh I get where we went wrong now

1252
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
Thanks guys listen

1253
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
We had a great deposition

1254
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:19,199
I'm in the 100% in the wrong whatever it is you say is true I'm going to get out of here I'm supposed to give

1255
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:24,831
The presentation that were just looking for the truth and the hard questions that no one else will and right

1256
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,671
Exposing cover-ups in

1257
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Trying to

1258
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,559
This takes shortcuts and and push your political agenda in

1259
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,143
A different way because you know that if you did it on the merits

1260
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,287
No one will be interested if I argued with you about the thing you want to argue about it I would lose cuz you're right and wrong

1261
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:50,943
So instead what if I pretended that you don't exist and neither does anybody else have him just me and everything I think it's true

1262
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
Good

1263
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
The day

1264
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:00,159
Of the shooting or is it around there was in the 24 hours at time frame

1265
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
Don't got an email

1266
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,023
And this is an email where we get an appearance

1267
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
It's from an old friend of ours

1268
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,839
Likes to hide in the bush

1269
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:14,239
So do you know the guy

1270
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,263
He has

1271
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
Send an email to John bowne

1272
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
Who's Anna's forwarded

1273
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
To Adan Salazar

1274
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,503
Email before you

1275
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,807
Mr. Salazar

1276
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
In the front line

1277
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
Is Jonathan

1278
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,975
John infowars.com to you

1279
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
And

1280
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,399
Do you see the date that that

1281
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
This is

1282
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,287
Mister whoever Jonathan isn't it your testimony that you don't know who that is

1283
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,847
That's probably John bowne

1284
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
How do you spell last name

1285
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,199
Bowne

1286
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
And who is that

1287
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
Video producer

1288
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,319
Is he still there

1289
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,415
Outside but

1290
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
I think he's still employed by the precinct

1291
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
Okay

1292
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
And

1293
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,815
And you know who's mr. Rappaport was at the time correct

1294
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,935
I'm barely becoming familiar with him yet

1295
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
Spirograph

1296
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,287
In-N-Out

1297
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
Mr. Brown is forwarding you

1298
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,943
An email in an attached document that you received from mr. Rapaport

1299
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,503
On the day of the shooting correct

1300
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,319
Adam Pearson

1301
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,879
And if we scroll down

1302
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
The

1303
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,119
The document that was attached to the email

1304
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,935
Is dated December 15th 2012

1305
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,799
Insecure come to grief counselors over-the-hill pouring into Newtown Connecticut

1306
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,383
Do you recall reading this piece by mr. rap

1307
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Rapoport

1308
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
No

1309
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,783
You have any understanding as you sit here today without going through it what it says

1310
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,111
No

1311
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:10,719
Do you have an understanding of what mr. Rappaport

1312
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,071
If you was concerning the Sandy Hook shooting in the immediate aftermath

1313
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,399
No I don't know what mr. Edwards we will

1314
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,287
You know one is bound folded you this email

1315
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:30,943
Because he thought it was interesting and thought I might find it interesting Navy to republish

1316
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:37,343
You know it was republished by infowars.com

1317
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
I don't know

1318
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
The little weird

1319
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
It's a little weird

1320
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,303
I mean rapaport's unhinged weirdo sound like

1321
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:51,167
The idea that he's writing blogs questioning Sandy Hook the day of or the next day regular

1322
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,727
Yeah that's

1323
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,567
But the idea that John bowne has found and

1324
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,895
Thought hey you know who will enjoy this a dawn Salazar

1325
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
That is a little weird

1326
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,735
Isn't it a definitely

1327
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
If someone

1328
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,319
Where to email me that

1329
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,855
Altec fence

1330
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
A problem

1331
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,487
That be a problem there's something about add-on the people know

1332
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
Totally cool to send him weird s*** about Sandy Hook

1333
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:23,679
Yeah man I I just feel like if I were in being deposed

1334
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,727
By anyone

1335
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,567
And they asked me a question and I gave my response and then they were like

1336
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
Okay can we

1337
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,175
Do you see this on your screen Point Xavier want my first response be like

1338
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:48,511
Bring this up you'll be like well obviously I didn't say that now now I know that I didn't know that

1339
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
Oh no

1340
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,959
60s guns and is presenting

1341
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:03,359
The idea that he did not know his immediate aftermath that they were going to cover it

1342
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,407
As if it were

1343
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,967
In the immediate aftermath

1344
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,991
Of the

1345
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,599
The shooting that is month following the shooting is fair to say

1346
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
That

1347
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,903
You understood

1348
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,743
That your coverage was going to frame Sandy Hook

1349
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,535
As a staged event

1350
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
I wouldn't say

1351
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
I didn't know that in the immediate aftermath now

1352
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,471
So you're telling me that in that first month

1353
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,799
It was not your

1354
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,871
You were not aware at that time

1355
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,407
Or you do not have a view at that

1356
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
That

1357
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,247
Infowars coverage of the event

1358
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,295
Wood frame it as a staged event

1359
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
So important in as much as we have laid the framework of what we're talking about

1360
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
The immediate app

1361
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Yeah I'm talking about that month

1362
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
Yeah

1363
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,607
I think that's helpful

1364
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
Yeah

1365
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,911
I don't believe it on here but

1366
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,983
Throw this out there

1367
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Adan

1368
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,055
Earlier in the deposition

1369
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Says

1370
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,615
Why did I join Infowars

1371
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
Aha

1372
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:15,039
9/11 was an inside job right so you're very first moment of joining him for his if they hire

1373
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,855
Early early around

1374
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,903
Something being a false flag

1375
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:25,791
You knew exactly how they don't know that they're the false flag place

1376
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
Let their the one-stop-shop

1377
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,375
For false flag

1378
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,423
Yeah I mean

1379
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
Just done Aurora

1380
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:38,079
Like they have just done all their coverage but how that was fake

1381
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
No you're working there

1382
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:44,223
Oh my God yeah

1383
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
It's a little bit

1384
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,319
Pill to swallow

1385
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:54,719
Especially because you know obviously he would have in reporting on this is based on

1386
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:59,071
John Cena Nopalea course

1387
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,375
Any immediate aftermath of the shooting

1388
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
Am I correct that

1389
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,751
You did become aware of what you consider to be certain amount

1390
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
Cersei

1391
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,615
How is it that you

1392
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
Became aware of those anomalies

1393
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,711
What did you do to discover them

1394
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,991
Jackson

1395
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:25,439
I'm not sure if I receive tips on emails or found videos on YouTube but it was maybe a combination of the two

1396
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,791
In order to find videos on YouTube you would have to serve

1397
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
For something that you were looking for correct

1398
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,167
A link is provided somehow

1399
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,983
Bio social media or email

1400
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,335
You recalled doing any affirmative work on your own

1401
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
2

1402
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
Search

1403
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
YouTube or any other sites

1404
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:46,943
Anomaly

1405
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
I died in service

1406
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,319
I was probably provided with limited videos about it

1407
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,183
And you think those links may have, either through you viewing

1408
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,207
Social media

1409
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,791
Or through the writers email correct

1410
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,119
Right around Reddit ya various

1411
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
Various places

1412
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,935
YouTube yes

1413
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Were you looking for

1414
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
I would say I was looking for them now

1415
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,920
Batman all this information

1416
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:23,040
Belize just kept popping up

1417
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:29,440
Yeah I think this is not follow the story this is the first

1418
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:35,584
This is the only episode I think that Ivar show where if you just put Liz in my chair

1419
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,984
Based on his descriptions of her job she would be making

1420
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:47,616
Who works in Media or journalism hearing this and not being offended

1421
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:54,016
Nothing means anything anymore right people who have worked so hard

1422
01:20:54,272 --> 01:21:00,416
I'm just on the in the trenches grinding right

1423
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:06,816
Research they've got people who actually go out there fact-checkers and everything everything

1424
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:13,216
Even people who do like a lot of the behind-the-scenes good journalism

1425
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:19,616
It's kind of like I don't know I don't know

1426
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
Six figures tomorrow

1427
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
There's also email

1428
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Strip like from Rapaport

1429
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,088
For this other email from Rapaport

1430
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:32,416
You see that this is an 8-page document and page one

1431
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
Using email

1432
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,256
From Jonathan to you

1433
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,816
With an indication that there is a

1434
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,120
Attachment the middle Adam Lanza mask

1435
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
Yes I see that

1436
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,728
And you see that

1437
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,080
The email from Jonathan is a forwarded email again from this to rapport

1438
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,504
Look like it was sent from John Rappaport to John bowne and then John bowne forwarded to me

1439
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Correct

1440
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,344
And the date that mr. Brown

1441
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Received it

1442
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,160
Mr. Rapaport

1443
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
Resent it to

1444
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:09,024
Mr. ballen was December 16th 2012 correct

1445
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
I see that yes

1446
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Good that would that would have been

1447
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,888
2 days after the shooting

1448
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
I believe so yes

1449
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,240
And if you scroll down in the document

1450
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:23,360
Again similar to the last email we looked at there's an attachment

1451
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,992
With a written piece that appears to be authored by mr. Rappaport correct

1452
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Yessir

1453
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,856
And the title is to movies to mass murders

1454
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:41,536
With a subtitle that says The Dark Knight Rises in The Hunger Games

1455
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
Okay

1456
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
Correct

1457
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,400
It doesn't look like

1458
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
Sometime it looks like it's the lead sentence in this

1459
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,496
Okay okay

1460
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
Alright fine

1461
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,920
Is sent this to John bowne

1462
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:08,160
Is the first one that John Valentine's me and maybe if I'm not interested I say don't send me s*** like that

1463
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,952
Weird another one

1464
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,512
Next day sounds like maybe this happen

1465
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
Regularly

1466
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,888
Doesn't know if he actually even read this

1467
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
Okay you're not sure

1468
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
Courtesy

1469
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
You eventually develop an interest

1470
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,104
In the Nexus

1471
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,688
Between the movie The Dark Knight Rises and the Sandy Hook shooting correct

1472
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,504
Yes it was an interest in it.

1473
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,088
Possible that that interest may have been

1474
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Bye

1475
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,952
This particular piece

1476
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
Wish

1477
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,768
I can scroll down

1478
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,328
Draws a connection

1479
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Between

1480
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
The Batman movie

1481
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,448
The Aurora shooting

1482
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,496
Aunt Sandy Hook

1483
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,336
My question to you is

1484
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,872
It's possible that

1485
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,200
This particular email which you received

1486
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,088
Spark your interest in the Nexus between the movie The Dark Knight Rises and Sandy of the Sandy Hook shooting correct

1487
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,440
It's possible I can't say for sure I don't know if I read this article the time

1488
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,232
But minivan

1489
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,048
It appears that you received this email

1490
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Shortly after the shooting correct

1491
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:26,752
It's honestly too bad for Adam that he didn't read this article because if he had he could defend himself here

1492
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:33,408
The conspiracy that add-on spread about Sandy Hook in Batman had to do with the name Sandy Hook appearing on the map in the movie

1493
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
The Dark Knight Rises

1494
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:38,016
That was an article Rapaport wrote on December 18th

1495
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,368
But the one from the 16th which is being discussed here since it was forwarded to add-on

1496
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
Is actually about something else

1497
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
The Batman part of this has to do with the Aurora shooting happening at a screening of Batman and the theories about James Holmes thinking he was

1498
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:51,840
The Joker

1499
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,400
In this article Sandy Hook relates to the hunger

1500
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
Games

1501
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,984
I'm going to read you hear some of John Rappaport

1502
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,288
Brilliant work please

1503
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,616
We now have the boggling connection to the Hunger Games

1504
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:10,016
And that sci-fi novel and film 24 children are picked to take part in the competitive National blood sacrifice killing

1505
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
Ritual

1506
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,600
One child survives at the end of 23 die

1507
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,648
20 died in Newtown

1508
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,256
And the author of The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins lives in Sandy Hook next to Newtown

1509
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,792
And this means

1510
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:27,168
This is just the kind of bizarre and insane op secret societies are reputed to enjoy

1511
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:31,776
Ordinarily I would ignore this sort of thing and just call it a coincidence but it's

1512
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,056
Too improbable

1513
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,896
I can't prove the killings in Newtown were part of a kind of op

1514
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
But I can't disregard it either

1515
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,760
The quote coincidence is just too stunning

1516
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:48,160
Headed The Hunger Games connection is real here then then all bets are off

1517
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
Incidents that Rappaport finds two stunning is nearby and the number of children were killed in the

1518
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,376
The Hunger Games of doesn't match the number dead at Sandy Hook

1519
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:03,264
But it's kind of close

1520
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:09,664
This is the kind of dumb s*** that Rapaport was writing 2 days after the shooting that you thought it was worth sending.

1521
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
On who I almost guaranteed did read it

1522
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:18,368
He may think it's in his best interest to not know anything about the article in this deposition but the idea that he wasn't interested in this

1523
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:24,512
It just flies right everything I've been able to tell about him from his work

1524
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,560
Ime mockery

1525
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,400
I think I would have made it two sentences into that email before I go to throw Mike

1526
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:36,800
Computer at the window ottoman like

1527
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:41,152
What if it says Jon rappoport on it I'm not interested how about that

1528
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,712
Yeah to better lb

1529
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:47,040
Where's David at

1530
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:53,440
So done apparently is not only a receiver of emails

1531
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,232
Email to Melissa

1532
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,536
Who is a former employee of Infowars

1533
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
December 9th

1534
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
That's a little ant

1535
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,912
Do you have this email before you star witch

1536
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
Is an email from you

1537
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,496
To Melissa Melton

1538
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,568
On December 19th 2012

1539
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
I see that here

1540
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
Who is Melissa Melton

1541
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
Choose a previous employee

1542
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,784
What was her role in it

1543
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
Infowars at the time

1544
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,648
Video producer splash

1545
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:26,464
I guess you read some articles that she was a partial letter

1546
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
Subject line please

1547
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,144
Says

1548
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Forward

1549
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:38,496
Connecticut police radio purple band mask men

1550
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,288
One dressed as a nun

1551
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,848
And can you read

1552
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
The text that you emailed to miss Milton

1553
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:52,576
Look at this end in from a reader don't know if you caught the showed that day but a caller said a nun game

1554
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
Entry to the school

1555
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,952
And why did you share that information with Miss Melton

1556
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,280
Looks like I was

1557
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,584
Going out to the email before

1558
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
Well

1559
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,264
Probably interested in the anomalies

1560
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,920
So you were sending this to miss Melton because you were interested

1561
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
In

1562
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,736
The possibility that

1563
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,784
Someone dressed as a nun

1564
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Had gained entry

1565
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,856
To the school on the day of the shooting

1566
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,184
Moriarty sharing of

1567
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
Weird

1568
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,512
Weird Tale

1569
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,328
Weird Tale

1570
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:41,728
I mean sure I thought it was true but then when you said it out loud back to me now I think it was a weird Tales

1571
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:48,128
Location of cramps

1572
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,432
Secret society

1573
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:56,832
Okay see you sent a weird tale to Melissa Melton about a nun on gaining access

1574
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:00,160
Most of the school obviously is because there was another shooter

1575
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:04,768
And that same day something else happened at Infowars

1576
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
This exhibit

1577
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Is it pure to you

1578
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
Mr. Salazar to be

1579
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,544
A headline in the text of an article that was published on infowars.com in December 19th 2012

1580
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
Yes

1581
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,664
This is the article in earlier

1582
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,224
That

1583
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
I believe you

1584
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,808
Attributed to a particular

1585
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Dapper Aaron dykes

1586
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:31,904
Correct

1587
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,696
Yeah I think it was he

1588
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,328
Would you wear my uncle at the time it was published

1589
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,400
Only when it went up on the website

1590
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
Pretty sure I did

1591
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:52,896
Here's something that Maddy might not know or

1592
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,504
Just isn't bringing up that makes this all a bit suspicious these these two clips

1593
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:03,904
So we just heard on the same day December 19th. His email and Melissa Melton about a Sandy Hook conspiracy

1594
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,744
Here's a theory and Aaron Dykes is posting this article to fame and Robbie Parker

1595
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:12,608
The connective tissue that's missing is that Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton were a couple

1596
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,264
Leaving Infowars together and they started their own Outlet called truthstream media and no spoken pretty poorly about

1597
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,824
Alex

1598
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,896
They're married now and Melissa is taking on Aaron surname

1599
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:31,552
It seems difficult for me to imagine that you have Aaron actively posting the Sandy Hook conspiracy s***

1600
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,112
I ended on emailing his girlfriend other

1601
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:40,512
Sandy Hook conspiracy s*** and that doesn't translate to a group of people intensely interested in Sandy Hook conspiracy

1602
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:47,680
That's that to me is something that doesn't doesn't pass the smell test

1603
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
To be pretty good at pool

1604
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,800
I used to be pretty good pool at one time I was watching these two

1605
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,872
Really really good Hustlers who accidentally

1606
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
Wind up playing against each other like they f***** up

1607
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
And

1608
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:04,320
They were they were so good like after the first couple of games they realize what was going on

1609
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
And then they would just

1610
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,904
Moves so fast it be like

1611
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,304
If there were four balls left on the table that they think you could run those out they just rip them off the table lamp.

1612
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,096
Next game next game like that

1613
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
If

1614
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,936
If we were in this kind of high-level situation

1615
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,472
I think it down would have been like

1616
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,872
Alright you got me on this one next question flipped out next month will swipe these off the table you want

1617
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,224
Not a lot of money

1618
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,832
Yeah I think that I would be very interested in that

1619
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,112
Piece of information being

1620
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:44,256
Brought is a rebuttal

1621
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,816
Conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook

1622
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,632
Zidane doesn't necessarily have like

1623
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,424
A concrete proof that he was talking

1624
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,824
Aaron Dykes about his article about Robbie Parker play how many riders are there at the time not many real working

1625
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
The same office

1626
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,896
Like I I find it on

1627
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,176
Unbelievable

1628
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:08,576
That the two of them wouldn't have been at least in some kind of contact that an anomaly

1629
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,368
It is an obelisk

1630
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,952
Ironically

1631
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:20,864
It sort of has the hint of a conspiracy

1632
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,936
So

1633
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,752
Joseph Watson email looking for tips

1634
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,568
Hook conspiracy article he was writing

1635
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
You have an email before you sir

1636
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,944
From you to tell Joseph Watson

1637
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,576
Call Papa table

1638
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,672
If you have the time can you look at

1639
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,720
Can you take a look at the article attending

1640
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,816
Publishing on the back end of Infowars I did a little bit of research into Sandy Hook

1641
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,888
Batman coincidence

1642
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,192
Was substituted for another name on the map

1643
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:58,240
Maybe you got

1644
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,544
Tips for something you'd like to add

1645
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,616
I think I should mention the article or better by Banks

1646
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,296
The article that you were referencing

1647
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:16,416
I think it's the one about Sandy Hook maps and stuff I mean Batman Maps

1648
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Yeah

1649
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,512
This is an article that you wrote

1650
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,048
In which you recorded

1651
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
That

1652
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:24,864
Matt

1653
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,656
That appears in the movie

1654
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
The Dark Knight Rises

1655
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,984
Add a location

1656
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,776
That have been changed

1657
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,848
From South Hinckley to Sandy Hook

1658
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Correct

1659
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
Yes

1660
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,736
You of call wasserman's back to you on this

1661
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,552
I don't think he wasn't as interested in this

1662
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:47,392
Stories hours

1663
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,512
That's revealing

1664
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,072
I mean we already knew that Paul wasn't down with this s***

1665
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
But like

1666
01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:02,752
You to say he wasn't as interested in it as I was

1667
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,544
Doesn't look right

1668
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,360
So this is about December 20th

1669
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,664
Right here is where things got a little bit can

1670
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,688
Confusing for me

1671
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,016
Because there was an article posted on the 17th

1672
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,552
On Infowars about

1673
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,856
The map in The Dark Knight Rises

1674
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:23,232
And then there's another article that's an update of it that's the one that Don is talking about write believe

1675
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:28,608
Okay I'm not sure if he wrote the original one on the 17th because they both

1676
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:35,008
Have infowars.com as the writer tribution but he

1677
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,360
And obviously he's emailing Paul about it

1678
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,944
Presumably he would think you wrote the first 12

1679
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,480
But who knows

1680
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,528
I mean that could have been just a

1681
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,576
It's like they could have stolen that one two who knows

1682
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:54,464
Can't nail it down.

1683
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,536
Someone else got a little update about that

1684
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,608
Email from you to the drugs

1685
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,960
Just read the Drudge Report

1686
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,752
And Jacqueline

1687
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,288
That you wrote

1688
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,384
Was bizarre Sandy Hook Dark Knight Rises connection correct

1689
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
Yes

1690
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,968
And you wrote

1691
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,016
Infowars has exposed

1692
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,064
That a section of Gotham City

1693
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,648
Was renamed Sandy Hook in the latest Dark Knight release

1694
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:26,208
And you include a link

1695
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,000
To the story correct

1696
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,304
Yes that was a story that you wrote

1697
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,608
That's the one I wrote I believe you

1698
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:38,752
In that story was written and published six days after the Sandy Hook shooting correct

1699
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,592
And you didn't ask Drudge

1700
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,944
Will help us spread the news of this very strange coincidence correct

1701
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,576
But this point we haven't very least Infowars has a story about this

1702
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:59,232
Batman thing is after the attack then six days after the shooting

1703
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,328
There's another one that add-on is written

1704
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
The Drudge Report

1705
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,376
2

1706
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:11,776
Disseminated more widely the arguments

1707
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,616
Responsible for the spread of it especially in the early days

1708
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,432
It was very out the window in terms of

1709
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:21,760
The size of the reap that Infowars has at this time

1710
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:26,880
They're active cording of drudge the largest link aggregator in the right-wing

1711
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,928
I am maybe all of

1712
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
Yeah time it was like the biggest

1713
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,536
The internet and that it's

1714
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,096
That to me is like really damning

1715
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,656
That email is pretty it's a bad luck

1716
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:41,472
Yeah I do I could not be deposed

1717
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,824
This weather if you listen to the video of me being deposed if this was me

1718
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,104
I will just be like

1719
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:54,016
Don't read it, and I know I sent it

1720
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952
Sucked up because it's not like an interrogation where you can just get fast

1721
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:08,352
Let's just move on.

1722
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:16,288
Let's just go to jail instead of talk to you anymore

1723
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:22,688
Reason that this is something that would be interesting to Adan Salazar now you might have

1724
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,528
Imagine that the obvious answer is because

1725
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,392
If somebody who worked on Batman that it already come out

1726
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:37,536
Wright had changed the name of this place on the map to Sandy Hook

1727
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:41,632
And then later Sandy Hook happen yeah it would lead one to think

1728
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,936
Maybe they did that as a message

1729
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:49,312
There's this whole idea of predictive programming that is really big and Alex's coverage of stuff

1730
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:53,408
So the argument here the shorthand is very clear that it's

1731
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:56,224
Trying to argue for foreknowledge

1732
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,248
Way to

1733
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,808
Unless you're Adan You could argue that it's not

1734
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:02,624
If you can argue that there was a psychic power no

1735
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,416
Coincidence

1736
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,000
Mr. Salazar

1737
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
The reason you were reporting on this

1738
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,840
Is because

1739
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,632
The fact that

1740
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:17,984
A map location in The Dark Knight Rises have been changed to Sandy Hook

1741
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,032
Call YouTube suspect

1742
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,152
Whether there had been some sort of advanced knowledge by somebody

1743
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,456
That the Sandy Hook shooting was going to take

1744
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
Correct

1745
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
Injection

1746
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:35,648
I don't know if that was my belief of the time I just thought it was a very bizarre strange coincidence that I thought needed to be highlighted

1747
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:40,000
Why did you think she did it and what relevance was it

1748
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
Your coverage

1749
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,424
I think it's relevant to the name of a map changes on a movie you know when it's supposed to

1750
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,752
Be something else and then Sandy her changes to Sandy Hook and then

1751
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,032
Something happens

1752
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,616
Place called Sandy Hook in the same year that the movies released

1753
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,664
Coincidence

1754
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,480
And so help me explain

1755
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
Why that

1756
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,856
Is relevant it seems and correct me if I'm wrong

1757
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
That

1758
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,952
What you are inviting your audience to consider

1759
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
Is that it's not a coincidence at all

1760
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Correct injection Farm

1761
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,656
I wasn't inviting the audience to consider that I was asking you

1762
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,752
It may be they perhaps update coincidences bizarre to

1763
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,056
I think I point out the fact that

1764
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
The problem

1765
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,152
Manager of the movie

1766
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,200
Lived in Sandy Hook

1767
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,992
Maybe in one of the articles

1768
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,552
Newtown Connecticut

1769
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:41,440
What should the same place the shooting took place I thought that was all bizarre

1770
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:48,096
Was the stage X was trying to find out a bizarre coincidence

1771
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:53,472
Just so we're clear here's the second paragraph of the article add-on wrote and sent a Drudge

1772
01:39:53,984 --> 01:40:00,128
Minor coincidence we've scoured the Batman movies and poured over various Gotham City

1773
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,688
Define anything that could support the theory

1774
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:07,808
That the movies may have had him to a foreknowledge of the tragic Massacre that occurred last week

1775
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:13,440
Because where there's smoke there's usually fire what we found is interesting to say the least

1776
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:17,536
This isn't quite how he's describing his writing in this deposition

1777
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:23,936
Is Grace from the article it sounds like they were studying these Maps searching for Clues to prove that there was foreknowledge and that they found

1778
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Interesting stuff

1779
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,264
And where there's smoke there's usually fire

1780
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,824
Covert and it's point I would say

1781
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,408
Yeah imma dog doesn't point out that the prop master was from Sandy Hook

1782
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:40,064
He does bring up that there's a Sandy Hook in New Jersey but it's kind of a non-sequitur between heavy insinuation of it

1783
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,856
Conspiracy and then this

1784
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:44,928
Quote for those who were left asking why would someone do that

1785
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:50,816
Alfred pennyworth Bruce Wayne in the Dark Knight movie

1786
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,632
Some men aren't looking for anything logical like money

1787
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:58,496
They can't be bought bullied reason to negotiate it with some men just want to watch the world burn

1788
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,288
The article ends with this

1789
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,920
If you're enjoying spotting these bizarre coincidences and traveling down the road of curiosity with us

1790
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:11,552
Stay tuned for tomorrow's scintillating Revelation that the song The Smoking Gun

1791
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:15,648
Needed to tie the Dark Knight Rises the Aurora massacre at the Sandy Hook tragedy

1792
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:20,512
We guarantee will leave you wondering exactly WTF is going on

1793
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:24,096
Oh my God what does really seem like someone is just in case Miss weird

1794
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:30,496
Jesse's anytime I'm in a deposition I just want to make sure that I've never written the word guarantee

1795
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:36,128
Such a f****** s*** hat

1796
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,456
It's an interesting

1797
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:44,064
Approach that add-on is taking Maddie is asking like

1798
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,856
Why is this relevant

1799
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:52,256
I just something kind of interesting it's a weird

1800
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,792
Jaguars eat

1801
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,584
And this

1802
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,472
When I told you about like this being like an incredibly frustrating kind of a while

1803
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,544
This seems to be a

1804
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,104
Stumbling

1805
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:13,504
There are difficulties in getting add-on to admit at all that he was making a point.

1806
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,808
What are you doing the writer

1807
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,344
I just throw words out

1808
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:23,744
This weird

1809
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,144
Revelation of a smoking gum tomorrow

1810
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,936
He's really just a Pontiac

1811
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:38,592
To the extent that would be any salience to The Coincidence is that

1812
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
Define salient

1813
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,688
The fact that

1814
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:46,784
Aim application in a movie had been changed

1815
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
To the name of a place

1816
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
Where is shooting later occurred

1817
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,696
Could potentially be evidence that

1818
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,744
Somebody involved in that movie

1819
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:59,072
At awareness that are shooting would later occur there correct

1820
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
Production

1821
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:06,240
I don't know what it signified I just thought it was a bizarre coincidence that people should

1822
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
Maybe looking to

1823
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:13,664
Highlighted highlighted it for the audience because I thought it was interesting and I thought they'd find it interesting as well

1824
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:20,064
It's just a bizarre coincidence that doesn't mean cuz I wasn't trying to make a point

1825
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,696
Come on come on man account

1826
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,464
Did this happen

1827
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:29,024
I'm going to show you exhibit a a

1828
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,144
You actually

1829
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,424
Posted your

1830
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,448
Article

1831
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,800
To Facebook

1832
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,592
And that's exhibit AA

1833
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:43,872
Before you correct

1834
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,552
And contrary to the testimony you just gave which is you were just putting out the coincidence

1835
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,880
Including commentary there that called the police sentence

1836
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
Very fishy

1837
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,672
Correct

1838
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
Injection

1839
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,840
It looks like it says that can you zoom in a little more

1840
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,120
Yeah that's the problem

1841
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,984
Yeah I put very fishy

1842
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,544
Switch you met

1843
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,824
To sow doubt

1844
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,616
About whether there was in fact

1845
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,664
Knowledge on somebody's part

1846
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Of the shooting correct

1847
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,784
I didn't I just pointing out that it's a bizarre coincidence I'm not trying to

1848
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
Showdown

1849
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,624
Really itchy

1850
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Seems like

1851
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,768
Pointing out that it's a bizarre coincidence

1852
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,816
No Doubt

1853
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:39,936
I think that Chris Mattie's delivery of that it seems fishy

1854
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
Is just right on point

1855
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
Because like

1856
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:49,664
That is the kind of thing that you could just repeat to somebody

1857
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:55,808
I wasn't say I wasn't trying to slow down or make this look suspicious when you said

1858
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:03,744
I think that's one of the probably didn't think like

1859
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:10,400
I didn't post anything on my Facebook

1860
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,728
Such like of course you're constantly surprised

1861
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,520
Put their bring you it's up to you

1862
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,080
You didn't research the things you did

1863
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:24,480
And you're used to working with a bunch of Ding Dongs and I'll do anything you don't understand like how

1864
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,248
Processive

1865
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:29,088
Actual exploration might work

1866
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
How did you get that

1867
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,416
You know like I know it

1868
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,184
Public

1869
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,000
Stickman you can find it anytime you want

1870
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:38,560
Crazy shemane

1871
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
Anomalous word reader

1872
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:48,288
Doesn't jive

1873
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,176
So the next day after this add-on is working on another Sandy Hook conspiracy theory

1874
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,272
December 21st

1875
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,832
And this will be

1876
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Xzibit number 11

1877
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,024
You latched onto

1878
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
A different

1879
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
Banana

1880
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
Do you recall

1881
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,168
Becoming aware

1882
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,216
That an online

1883
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,752
Movie review

1884
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,080
A movie

1885
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:25,920
Entitled Sandy Hook lingerie party Massacre

1886
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,712
Had been published

1887
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,272
In the days prior to shooting you work all that

1888
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:33,600
Yes and you referenced an exhibit 11 but have no

1889
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,624
Donut

1890
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,392
Correct

1891
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,000
You work all as you're sitting here without looking at an exhibit

1892
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,536
Becoming

1893
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,840
Aware of an interested

1894
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
In the fact

1895
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,400
Dad

1896
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:51,520
Somebody get published an online review of this movie before the Sandy Hook shooting correct

1897
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:57,664
I'm about to review but I was aware of the movie or something somehow it crossed

1898
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,200
My path

1899
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
Probably some

1900
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:07,136
John Rappaport email is on Reddit

1901
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:11,744
Butler's in a bad language

1902
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,512
Correct

1903
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:17,632
Oh f*** that means exhibit 11th going to make my client look real Dumbo no

1904
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,960
Did you think that this movie was

1905
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,264
Fishing

1906
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,128
Add ons working on this this article about the lingerie party Massacre

1907
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:32,224
And there's some emails these have come up in other deposition

1908
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:38,880
Where Don is emailing the guy who wrote the review I believe share and discuss

1909
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:45,280
Somehow like hey you know there's one people who are spreading the rumor that you know you are maybe at foreknowledge of

1910
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:54,240
But we're going to ride it anyway know that's a bad idea it's always fun when

1911
01:47:54,496 --> 01:48:00,640
Deposition setting you get to make someone read their own email

1912
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
Scroll down to the beginning

1913
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,272
The email and I'll just go down there but it's use one page

1914
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,832
And am I correct sir that

1915
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
You sent

1916
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,392
I'm in email

1917
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:12,928
On

1918
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,464
December 21st

1919
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:16,512
7 days after the shooting

1920
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,816
UA Miss Gonzalez

1921
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,584
Is that correct

1922
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,912
Mr. Gonzalez Seattle

1923
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
Mr. Gonzalez

1924
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,032
And your email reads

1925
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
Ashley can you read it for me

1926
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,896
There is a vicious rumor that the date

1927
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:38,528
You posted your review of the Sandy Hook lingerie party Massacre on your site base / above.com

1928
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,368
Shows for knowledge or prior planning of the events that have taken

1929
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,648
Place as of late

1930
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,208
Likely to links

1931
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:52,608
At first we thought this was surely ridiculous however we're going to point it out in an article and

1932
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,632
Would like

1933
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,680
Give me the opportunity to provide a common

1934
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:02,336
In an article anyway right

1935
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:10,528
Wonder if that's inattentional Omission not as part of reading it because the anyway there really is

1936
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,648
Is a word that shows like

1937
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:22,048
You're sending this person an admission that you don't even believe the s*** you're going to post you're going to do it anyway

1938
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,840
Play is a shiv to your gut

1939
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:30,240
That is what the anyway is for I don't understand what goal would be of not reading the word I mean

1940
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:35,872
Cuz you don't want to read it cuz the anyway really makes you sound like you just shipped somebody in the gut

1941
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,408
Bebe

1942
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:44,064
Weird instincts don't make me read my already but I would have me again I can't be deposed the whiny voice

1943
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:50,208
Don't make me read it

1944
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:53,280
Arrest me to email that he's sending

1945
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:56,608
Involves a notion of foreknowledge

1946
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
Because

1947
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,936
That's literally what he says in the email

1948
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:03,264
So you might think that covering this story

1949
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,336
Liza Don does

1950
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,104
For him

1951
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
2

1952
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:10,688
Cast aspersions on the reality of the shooting

1953
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,272
And imply that the audience maybe you should consider that there's

1954
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,320
For planning for knowledge

1955
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,928
Not Manny wasn't make an appointment

1956
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,720
But the rumor that you were

1957
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
Informing mr. Gonzales out was that

1958
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,840
The fact that you had posted the review

1959
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,656
Sometime in advance and the Sandy Hook shooting

1960
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,520
Could be evidence that he was aware of the shooting take place correct

1961
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,360
I believe that's what I was questioning

1962
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:42,944
And you thought that it was surely ridiculous at first

1963
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
Right

1964
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:45,760
Yes

1965
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
Yes

1966
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,856
Why did if it was ridiculous

1967
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,672
Where you going to include it in an article anyway

1968
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,744
Because it was just another bizarre

1969
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,304
Coincidence that I found interesting that I thought I

1970
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,840
Leadership would find interesting

1971
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:03,424
In the reason that you thought they would find interesting

1972
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,960
Is because

1973
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,496
You

1974
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:09,568
We're trying to highlight evidence for them

1975
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,616
Suggesting

1976
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,640
That

1977
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,688
This was an event

1978
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,504
Of which certain people had foreknowledge correct

1979
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,528
Objection

1980
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:25,440
I wasn't particularly trying to highlight that there was an event that people had foreknowledge of more so that I

1981
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,792
I thought this was a weird anomaly that people should keep their eye on and maybe

1982
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:36,960
Read about in F

1983
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:43,616
Kind of it reminds me a little bit of a child being like I'm not hating you

1984
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,712
This

1985
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,272
I mean Jesus Christ

1986
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,576
At a certain point just be like

1987
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,880
If you're going to play if you don't play dumb

1988
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:58,208
You're playing the wrong amount of done like Isaac so

1989
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:00,256
This is dumb enough where I'm like your f******

1990
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,352
Can plan your an ass off you got to go way too far going to try

1991
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,632
You got to be like

1992
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
Holy s*** that is the

1993
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:13,568
First time that I have thought of that connects I can't believe I didn't consider that honestly now that you brought that up

1994
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:19,968
To me that sounds like a crazy thing I did I'm so sorry now you know what it's weird that I accidentally

1995
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:24,832
Speculated about that in the articles that your ass that's why

1996
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,112
Corey Blake just

1997
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,952
I don't know I entirely open mind and be like

1998
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,024
Oh yeah that is what I was if you write that doesn't make sense

1999
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:39,680
But I don't know maybe that's a bad road to go pick a good way to go but this is

2000
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:46,592
So Maddie ask sadhana about like these anomalies and stuff and actually this MO

2001
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:50,432
Moment for me

2002
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,736
Something that I've never really thought about

2003
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,784
You yourself weren't convinced

2004
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,576
At this point.

2005
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:58,368
The evidence you were

2006
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,648
Collecting

2007
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
Established

2008
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:05,024
Somebody other than Mister Lana that had foreknowledge of the event correct

2009
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,304
Dakshin

2010
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:09,632
At the time I was still kind of

2011
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,216
I guess trying to convince myself

2012
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,496
Put the pieces together

2013
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:19,360
For any of your coincidences the law enforcement did you

2014
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:27,296
I'd never thought about that if they took this seriously

2015
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:33,696
Somebody at law enforcement why wouldn't they try to I mean obviously threatened to believe any of this

2016
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,536
You know that would be something that you probably have

2017
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,840
Some kind of at least moral obligation

2018
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:46,240
Yeah took any of this seriously that's one of those things that you when you're when you're too

2019
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,008
Close to stuff

2020
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:50,592
If you can't see it but if you step back and you look at that is that's so simple

2021
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:56,992
Edit demolishes everything. It's so simple for granted by us because of the like how long we've been

2022
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,528
Doing tonight how budget

2023
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:04,928
Repetitively born out rat take this seriously

2024
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:08,000
Like consideration

2025
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:10,048
Great question

2026
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:13,120
If you really thought this wouldn't you at least talk to them about it because of

2027
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:18,496
Very very serious implications of this are earth-shattering so

2028
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,032
Wouldn't you at least try

2029
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:24,640
Right I need to be like will know because the whole system is going to be but yeah

2030
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:31,040
Well that's not an excuse to not try especially not if you're using somebody who's a former cop or whatever is your purse

2031
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,088
Find somebody who's a former cop till like

2032
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:39,488
Easier into them or whatever text Uncle is a former FBI agent

2033
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:40,768
Come on come on

2034
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,304
Come on

2035
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:48,960
So I really enjoyed this class it's a little longer but

2036
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,728
It has to be

2037
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:52,288
And you were at this time or where

2038
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,104
That

2039
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,200
Of allegations that

2040
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:02,784
One or more of the parents of Sandy Hook children

2041
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,320
At work racism

2042
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Actors correct

2043
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:10,976
That's the rumor

2044
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,816
Did you believe it yourself

2045
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,912
I didn't really go into that

2046
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,728
Is everybody else did

2047
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,520
Benefactor

2048
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,568
But I wasn't really

2049
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:26,592
Interested in

2050
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,664
Trying to figure out whether they were crisis actors or not

2051
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
You wanted

2052
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,272
Not really

2053
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,344
Didn't really matter to the

2054
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,904
We're trying to make MerCruiser

2055
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,672
And I'd like

2056
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,464
Tentativas are anomalies that

2057
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,232
Writing

2058
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,792
Can you let me know

2059
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:49,376
And this will be exhibit number 12

2060
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,912
Why

2061
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:54,496
On January 6th 2013

2062
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:56,800
You attempted to establish an account

2063
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,104
At crisis actors. Org

2064
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:03,968
I'm not sure why

2065
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:09,088
You to look into people listed on the site or something I don't know

2066
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Got

2067
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
You agree that

2068
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,464
Number 12 is an email from

2069
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:18,048
Crisis actors that is a website to you

2070
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,888
Asking for you to verify your address

2071
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,960
So you can sign into the crisis actors website correct

2072
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,240
Yes

2073
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,800
If

2074
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,640
Michigan

2075
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,736
But your testimony here today is that you don't know why you did that

2076
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,832
Looks like I was trying to investigate

2077
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:41,856
See if maybe

2078
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:46,208
Wondered maybe if they're listed as crisis actors on there I don't I don't know what

2079
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,024
Yeah any Avenue I can

2080
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,072
Possibly investigate I wanted to

2081
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,632
Do my due diligence

2082
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:55,936
I see you are wow

2083
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:56,960
You are

2084
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,240
Assumption

2085
01:56:58,752 --> 01:56:59,264
Is that

2086
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,568
You were trying to gain access to the site

2087
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,128
In the hope that you might be able to see

2088
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,920
If any of the

2089
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,480
Crisis actors

2090
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:10,016
Appearing on the website

2091
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,576
Out where the same as individuals

2092
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,112
Who were

2093
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:16,416
Family members of Sandy Hook victims correct

2094
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
Dakshin

2095
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:22,560
The time it looks like I was trying to figure out if any of the

2096
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,864
People involved in the Sandy Hook

2097
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,656
Event work

2098
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,216
Crisis actor says with a yes

2099
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,520
A track

2100
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,824
I'm not sure

2101
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,616
Urban anybody

2102
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,152
Might have been

2103
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,688
Some guy that was

2104
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,712
You know

2105
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,552
Interview

2106
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,856
What were the results of your

2107
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:49,440
Query of the crisis actors website

2108
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,280
Honestly I cannot tell you because I do not remember

2109
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:59,680
Okay really important information I got you got some expose level

2110
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:06,080
Stop and Maddie makes another great point after that in that is like well I mean if you'd gone on there and found somebody that was

2111
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:09,152
Was one of the Sandy Hook people who probably would have reported that right would have

2112
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
Kind of

2113
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,200
The fact that you didn't

2114
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,760
Kind of shows a baby you didn't

2115
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,064
You didn't report to your audience

2116
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,600
Find it

2117
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:18,368
Nope

2118
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,392
Nope

2119
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:25,792
It appears that to you you said earlier today that you did not know why that assassin kill

2120
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,584
Killed your wife now

2121
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:32,192
Do you know why the day before you signed up for can an assassin kill my wife. Org

2122
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,728
I don't I don't know

2123
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,776
I mean I look as long time ago

2124
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:40,896
I think I was just looking to see how is Essence are doing these days

2125
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,248
Are they making good money what their world like

2126
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,552
Interview

2127
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:54,208
And as far as the day before it goes I think that's just a bizarre coincidence

2128
01:58:57,536 --> 01:59:00,096
Oh my God

2129
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,400
Terrible

2130
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,680
Pure comedy moment

2131
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:06,752
Be like I'm really that interested in the crisis actor stuff

2132
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:11,872
Three weeks after the shooting try to join crisis actors

2133
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:18,272
How do I say well I guess I did do that there's just so many so many

2134
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,552
Stepping on a rake

2135
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:22,368
Bananas wow

2136
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:29,024
So there's another conspiracy that was going around the house with the idea that there was a fundraiser for Sandy Hook

2137
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,792
Published

2138
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,840
Before the shirai Ryu

2139
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,888
Dawn has to address

2140
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,448
On January 13th

2141
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:42,848
Well

2142
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:48,224
You agree that you are

2143
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,272
The recipient of this email

2144
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,368
And

2145
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,440
Descendre Sean Knowles you know who that is

2146
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:58,976
I do not

2147
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,704
In this email is encouraging you to go to a link

2148
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,264
Where

2149
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,824
According to

2150
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
The link

2151
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,408
A

2152
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,456
Sandy Hook Relief Fund

2153
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,040
Paige appeared three days before the shooting correct

2154
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:30,976
Mr Knowles seems to be playing out in this email

2155
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:34,560
I might have clicked the link I can't recall

2156
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,144
And

2157
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:41,216
Showing you exhibit number 13 a

2158
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
Thursday.

2159
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,712
This is an image of your Facebook account in which you

2160
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,784
Shared the post concerning

2161
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:55,808
This

2162
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,600
Issue of a

2163
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,392
Sandy Hook fundraising page beam

2164
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,928
Created three days before the shooting

2165
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:07,840
And you did that on January 11th 2013 right

2166
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,376
Yes

2167
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,936
Oh boy again

2168
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,984
You didn't do anything to investigate

2169
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,288
Weather in fact a relief fund has been

2170
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,360
Created three days before the shooting you just posted the link

2171
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:22,688
What's the link to Natural news on my Facebook yet

2172
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,760
And you did that

2173
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,832
Because did you say

2174
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,136
This was another

2175
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
Coincidence right

2176
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,208
Is that how you felt

2177
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:40,096
The Google thing I wasn't too sure about since I knew hug a little bit about how Google worked I wasn't

2178
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,376
So ready to

2179
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,168
Follow that

2180
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,704
How much do you know about Google

2181
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,984
Anomaly

2182
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:49,568
You were prepared to post about it but you weren't going to write an article about right

2183
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,176
Posted on Facebook for other people that might find it interesting yet

2184
02:01:54,688 --> 02:02:00,832
That's interesting because he's willing to spread this b******* that he knows is b*******

2185
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:05,696
Is nonsense but he still more than willing to put it out as if it is

2186
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,768
Interesting thing is that was a trap

2187
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,608
Because you got this email where this guy sending email on

2188
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,632
January 3rd

2189
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:18,496
13th music did you research this at all

2190
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:22,592
He posted it on Facebook two days prior

2191
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:28,992
That's not good that's bad

2192
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:35,392
Emailing him about the article that I don had posted on Facebook that has has been with spurred this email

2193
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:41,792
Jesus didn't look into it he didn't research it I mean

2194
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:46,912
What are those little pet peeves that I have in especially in situations like this is whenever it's like

2195
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:49,728
You can't say it seems like that's what he's doing

2196
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,264
I'm giving you a

2197
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,104
In the past that cannot be changed anymore

2198
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,128
It is done

2199
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
So this

2200
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:59,456
Does not seem like he says this he said that

2201
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,736
Correct

2202
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:09,440
So when they were talking about these Batman articles written

2203
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:14,816
The prop master was from Newtown

2204
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:20,448
He had mentioned that the New Jersey there's an island Sandy Hook

2205
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,728
The reason

2206
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:27,360
Adam thought that he brought up the prop Master is because this became another big conspiracy

2207
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,384
4

2208
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,408
Hymn O

2209
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:33,760
So basically the argument or the theory that goes around

2210
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,528
Is

2211
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:38,368
That this guy Scott getzinger is the name of

2212
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,648
The prop master

2213
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,440
He died in a car wreck

2214
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:48,096
Prior to the release of the past

2215
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:52,704
So the theory that people had was that he was responsible

2216
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,544
For changing the name to Sandy Hook and that's why they killed exact

2217
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:02,944
Because he knew too much ryra which sort of raises the question of why it was still in the movie

2218
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:08,832
If they knew that did it but they also killed him for it and then they left it in anyways

2219
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:12,928
Appears that add-on was pretty into this conspiracy

2220
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,488
This is disgusting little bit

2221
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:19,328
Here and I don't know

2222
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,864
How tall is is is

2223
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,656
Boring as a Dodger

2224
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,472
This is

2225
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,008
Am I correct

2226
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,336
Salazar another email that you sent this one to

2227
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,872
Elliot Brown

2228
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
Yes sir

2229
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:37,248
And you see that it's dated their January 28th

2230
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:38,784
2013

2231
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,600
Yes

2232
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,392
And in this email

2233
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,416
You are

2234
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:50,304
Asking him if he's free for an honest

2235
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,840
Journalist question correct

2236
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,168
Yes and you're referring to yourself they're correct

2237
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:01,568
Even he laughed at that exactly exactly

2238
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:06,432
And in the body of the email

2239
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:07,712
You ask him

2240
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:09,760
About

2241
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:12,832
The change in the title of the map

2242
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,880
In Dark Knight Rises

2243
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:18,976
And you ask him about

2244
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:22,048
This gentleman Scott getzinger Who was the

2245
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,072
Prop

2246
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,120
Master according to you

2247
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,912
Who passed away in a car at

2248
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
Incorrect

2249
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,496
Yes

2250
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,080
I inserted this situated in time

2251
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,384
That the time when you were

2252
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,712
Inquiring about

2253
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:43,296
The death of Scott getzinger was

2254
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:45,088
In January of 2013

2255
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,416
Yes it looks like

2256
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:53,024
And the coincidence that you

2257
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,560
We're referring to

2258
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,352
And we'll go back to your

2259
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:00,192
We'll go back to exhibit number 14

2260
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:01,728
This is the

2261
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,288
Email tell Furniture Direct

2262
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,336
Was that Mr katzinger

2263
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,664
Was associated with the movie The Dark Knight Rises

2264
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,200
And he

2265
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,992
Was killed in a car crash

2266
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,064
And lived in Newtown Connecticut correct

2267
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,624
Yes

2268
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:25,024
And you say we're struck me as extremely odd is that this dude hailed from you destitute Newtown Connecticut right

2269
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:28,352
And then you say at the end

2270
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,912
Definitely something fishy about it all

2271
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:35,520
About

2272
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
The facts

2273
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:38,848
That

2274
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:41,152
Somebody Associated the props

2275
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,944
Department with the Dark Knight Rises

2276
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:46,016
Was from Newtown and it died in a car accident

2277
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,552
Direction

2278
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:54,976
I thought it was

2279
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,024
Marriott

2280
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,328
Same year that this

2281
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:04,192
Movies put out in Sandy Hook is changed on a map something happens at a place called Sandy Hook

2282
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,264
And what you were suggesting

2283
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:09,056
Was that Mr guest singers

2284
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:09,824
Steph

2285
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:12,128
Was somehow

2286
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,408
Due to the fact

2287
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,968
That he had knowledge

2288
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:19,040
About why the map have been changed

2289
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:22,368
Injection honestly I did not have like

2290
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,648
Theory as to why

2291
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,672
Getsinger

2292
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:30,304
If he was murdered or killed or why he died in the car accident so I didn't really

2293
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,328
Haven't answered

2294
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,912
It did seem like a strange anomaly where the pointing out

2295
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:40,032
So infuriating thing where it's just

2296
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:47,200
The wave add-on is presenting his like I guess we're just a journalistic or media

2297
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:51,040
Coincidence

2298
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,576
Yeah that's

2299
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:55,392
I find to be a defensive

2300
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,464
Just heard of characterization

2301
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,488
Yeah it's silly

2302
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,280
Yeah it's fishy

2303
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:04,352
You are theoretically

2304
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,376
A writer

2305
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:08,192
And you're trying to insist to me that words don't have meeting

2306
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
This is a

2307
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:09,984
More or less

2308
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:13,568
Yeah and so Maddie makes this point and I think this is

2309
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:16,128
Important and that is that

2310
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:19,968
Coincidences don't mean anything unless there's a point to them

2311
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,272
Agree with me

2312
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:26,368
If something is a mere coincidence

2313
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,976
Meaning just happenstance

2314
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,584
There's nothing to know about it

2315
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,632
Correct there's no relevance to note again

2316
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,400
Right

2317
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:39,168
Productions

2318
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,984
They're big coincidences

2319
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,288
Little coincidences

2320
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,592
I think some of the big ones and does

2321
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:47,616
Deserve to be noticed

2322
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,152
Probably not

2323
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:59,392
Or investigated is because they signify that it may not be a coincidence at all

2324
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,928
Correct direction

2325
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:06,304
I'm not sure what the coincidence would point you honestly then

2326
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:09,120
What do the people have to look into on their own

2327
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,936
Is relevant

2328
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,728
8.2 something

2329
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Bright

2330
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:16,544
Injection

2331
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:19,104
Not necessarily I think

2332
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:21,408
What's can be highlighted without

2333
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,456
Them having a point to them either

2334
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:25,504
So your testimony is that

2335
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:29,856
When you're highlighting what you refer to as these coincidences

2336
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,648
You are

2337
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:37,024
Not intending to suggest anything about what they signify

2338
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,304
That's your testimony

2339
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,864
I'm trying to

2340
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:42,400
Tell the reader that

2341
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,960
This is going on and kind of weird

2342
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:46,752
What do you think about it

2343
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,544
I think at the bottom of one of my heart

2344
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,080
What do you think

2345
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:51,616
Sound off in the comments below

2346
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,432
People's attention

2347
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,272
It's just what value is there to coincidence

2348
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:01,856
That's the question you asked yourself

2349
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:06,464
I think at that point I realized Mister Salazar I am now going to bounce

2350
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:12,864
The tennis ball off your forehead every time you say something about your job that's pants shooting Lee insane what are you talkin about

2351
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:19,264
Coincidences man what are you talkin about

2352
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:25,664
Carmen Electra's birth name was Tara Patrick

2353
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:33,856
Isn't that a coincidence

2354
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:37,440
Not one of those little coincidences I mean it's like

2355
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:43,840
Do you really think like maybe you would run an article about how some people have the same middle name I mean that's a cool

2356
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:47,936
What do you what do you understand the word coincidence to meme

2357
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:56,640
I mean I understand what you mean by Bitcoins is little coincidences but that is not a description of there

2358
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,176
I'm leaving fullness

2359
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,712
That's insane

2360
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:06,880
I'm not sure you do know what it means by big or little Clinton cuz I'm not sure I do now that you say it like that

2361
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:09,952
I would mean by saying that means I do now

2362
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:13,024
I certainly feel for Chris Maddie quite a bit

2363
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:13,792
Because

2364
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:16,096
There is just a

2365
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:18,656
Like a real attempt to be like

2366
02:11:18,912 --> 02:11:20,192
Come on you're making a point

2367
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:25,824
There's a point that you're trying to make words have to have meaning and add-on will not go for it.

2368
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,896
Salazar that the reason you're

2369
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,176
Highlighting wood

2370
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:32,224
You claim are coincidences

2371
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:36,320
Is because you want your audience to suspect

2372
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,880
That's something like Sandy Hook

2373
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,160
In fact

2374
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,440
Did not occur

2375
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,976
As has been reported

2376
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:44,768
Isn't that your purpose

2377
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:45,792
Objection

2378
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,888
My purpose is to

2379
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,424
Point out the coincidences

2380
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,704
And let the reader make

2381
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:57,824
You have no interest at

2382
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,872
In suggesting to the reader

2383
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:02,176
What the relevance of the

2384
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,712
Coincidence might be

2385
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,504
That's your testimony

2386
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:10,368
I think I present the evidence I gather for them and allow the reader

2387
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,184
To make up their own mind yet

2388
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:17,792
So we we have one so Dakota here of the

2389
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,328
Did Sandy Hook prop

2390
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:20,608
Portion

2391
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,912
And so just that will ride this out here

2392
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,192
And then

2393
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:26,752
Exhibit number 16

2394
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,032
This is

2395
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,312
Your Facebook page

2396
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,640
Correct mr. Salazar

2397
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:36,736
In which you are posting on February 6th 2013

2398
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,576
Less than two months from the shooting

2399
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,136
Something from Intel hub

2400
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:45,440
Concerning Sandy Hook and you post

2401
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,512
Google Scott getzinger correct

2402
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Odd

2403
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:52,352
And that's because you wanted

2404
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,120
People

2405
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:54,400
2

2406
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:58,240
Discover the same

2407
02:12:58,496 --> 02:13:02,336
Nexus that you believe you and discovered between Mr getsinger's death

2408
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:05,664
The map in The Dark Knight Rises

2409
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,456
And the Sandy Hook shooting correct

2410
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,552
Yes I was wanting people to the anomaly

2411
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:16,160
Yunomi what you testified

2412
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:18,976
Had absolutely no significance to you correct

2413
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:20,000
Injection

2414
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:27,680
Said it had no significance I think I said it was a bizarre coincidence that people should be aware of

2415
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:31,008
But that did not signify anything to you correct

2416
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:35,360
But didn't signify that it was a staged mass shooting

2417
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:37,664
But it did signify something very bizarre

2418
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,944
Coincidence

2419
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,736
What did it signify

2420
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,552
It was just a bizarre coincidence

2421
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:46,368
It needed to be done.

2422
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,672
For what purpose

2423
02:13:55,072 --> 02:14:00,704
So they could investigate it on their own and potentially discover that in fact it wasn't a coincidence at all

2424
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,240
But that mr. getsinger

2425
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,520
Have been killed

2426
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:06,336
So as to silence him because he was aware

2427
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,616
That

2428
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:11,968
The change in the Sandy Hook map signified some Advance knowledge of the sheathing correct

2429
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,248
Direction

2430
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,832
I'm not sure what they would discover

2431
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,112
Honestly it was

2432
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,904
Very strange.

2433
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:20,928
Putting it out there

2434
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:26,304
I wanted them to Google Scott Gunslinger and

2435
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,840
See all the anomalies here

2436
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,448
Just see what happens just Google it see what you find

2437
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:39,360
Maybe you'll find some of his other work from his storied career in other movies like The Truman

2438
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:45,760
Maybe that's a reason to Google

2439
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:51,392
What is a page boy

2440
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:56,768
I did I don't know I don't know Chris Maddie personally as a no

2441
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:57,536
Some of the Texas

2442
02:14:57,792 --> 02:15:03,936
But I get the sense that maybe he enjoys that back and forth a little

2443
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:06,240
A little bit like that yeah

2444
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,968
Meaning to this

2445
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:21,600
Hey Quinton is the people should look into look into and find what what

2446
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:28,256
All right you're not going to okay frontal assault isn't going to work for you I'm going to go around the back with me about this one now okay

2447
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:31,072
So a lot of the stuff is fairly annoying certainly

2448
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:36,704
But there is some bike positivity that comes at the worst possible way

2449
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:38,752
You received an email

2450
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,288
Did you not in March

2451
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,312
On March 7th

2452
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,848
The 2013

2453
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,896
From Daniel DuPont

2454
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,272
And a few

2455
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:53,088
Please stay on top of the story

2456
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:58,720
No names of deceased to be released etcetera the attack appears to be completely stage

2457
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:01,536
The public knows that they are being lied to

2458
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:05,632
And you wrote back to him

2459
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:08,448
Thank you for the encouragement

2460
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:12,032
Mothman

2461
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:16,384
YouTube video that invoice and published in January correct

2462
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,432
Yeah

2463
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,456
Looks that way

2464
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:23,808
Play I would regret responding to a random email like that

2465
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:28,160
At this point like that would be like I didn't have to write back to that he didn't give us

2466
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:31,232
True moment though a true motive comedy where is like

2467
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,280
Yeah I don't think I read that one is like

2468
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:36,608
Let's see the reply that you said yeah

2469
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:44,288
Wow so now we finally get to conversation about Wolfgang halbig

2470
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:49,152
And his role in all of this and how Adan first learned about him

2471
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,200
What are the Articles you wrote

2472
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:54,784
Introduced the Infowars audience to Wolfgang halbig

2473
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:55,552
Extract

2474
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,928
How did you first learn of mr. Howell

2475
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:06,304
Heard he was interviewed

2476
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:09,888
And I went and listened to the interview on American Free Press

2477
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,776
Your interview

2478
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:40,352
No I got to look at the date on the article

2479
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:44,448
Let me show you what is Ben Marcus

2480
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:45,984
Exhibit 19

2481
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:50,848
You see an email from Ronald bastien's you

2482
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:52,896
Tom Bastian

2483
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:55,712
You got this guy and

2484
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,480
Yes

2485
02:17:56,736 --> 02:18:00,320
It's legit ask Alex to bring him on as a guest okay

2486
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:02,112
Nuketown.

2487
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:03,648
I've no idea

2488
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:07,232
And

2489
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,768
You understood

2490
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,072
Mr. Bastian to be

2491
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:14,144
Asking you to that booking hounded

2492
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,448
Yes it looks like them

2493
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:19,264
Sumter 1014

2494
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:30,784
So this interview on the American free press was released on February 11th 2014 so the email from Bastian

2495
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:33,088
Asking add-on to wedding came the next day

2496
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:40,000
It's probably not unreasonable to assume that add-on heard about the interview from this email unless he was closely monitor

2497
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:42,304
During everything put out by the aafp

2498
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:49,216
It's really good that add-on seems to not know who did that interview because if he did he'd have to say that it was Dave Gahan

2499
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:55,616
Harry friend of David Dukes who actually was the publisher of Jim feathers book nobody died at Sandy Hook

2500
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,384
Not the s***

2501
02:18:56,640 --> 02:19:02,784
Well and the guy who published that book that you're not supposed to really know all that much about he was the guy who was interviewing Wolfgang halbig

2502
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,600
Take the broad how big to the attention of

2503
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:07,904
Infowars Hellboy

2504
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:14,304
Actually I was I was looking around on Garrity Harry and he

2505
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,840
Italy has made some comments about like

2506
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,912
I think I might be responsible for Alex

2507
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:23,520
And Wolfgang halbig getting suits

2508
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,848
Yeah baby

2509
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:33,248
Even leaving aside who this interviewer was American Free Press is a

2510
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:37,856
Supremacist Willis carto which has a strange kind of Holocaust deniers as Riders

2511
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:40,416
This is where Adam was cruising

2512
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,184
To get new gas

2513
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:44,512
Particularly ones who's going to use to inflict severe trauma

2514
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:46,048
On the parents of murdered children

2515
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,584
Maybe do better

2516
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:50,400
That's not good

2517
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:51,424
A deposition

2518
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:55,008
Ask how many exhibits there are like

2519
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:58,080
Get as much information as you can before hand

2520
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,128
And and in fact I would say even

2521
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:05,760
Prepare because then when you go into this goes back to the first clips

2522
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:12,416
I'ma let's go to exhibit 19 ship you know you you know what exhibits are coming that's what's important that's what my

2523
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:13,184
Approach

2524
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,464
Sure

2525
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,232
Sure

2526
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:17,024
Ora or like

2527
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:21,376
Just be aware that you tried to sign up for crisis actors. Org

2528
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:27,776
Before you say I wasn't interested in crisis actors what websites you signed up for that are exactly the thing

2529
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:28,544
That you shouldn't have

2530
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:34,432
So I haven't heard this American Free Press interview

2531
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:37,504
He felt the need to of that

2532
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:40,576
Showing you exhibit 19 again

2533
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,488
Where mrhaliboot says

2534
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,792
Down here in this paragraph

2535
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:53,632
I think it's a scripted event that took place

2536
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:55,936
I think it was in planning for maybe two

2537
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:56,960
Two-and-a-half years

2538
02:20:59,008 --> 02:20:59,520
Yes

2539
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:04,384
Okay and that was mr. how big's allegation correct

2540
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,664
Yes

2541
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,944
Now the idea

2542
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:10,784
That a mass shooting at which 20 children were killed

2543
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,576
And six Educators were

2544
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:18,464
Have been scripted and planned for two-and-a-half years in advance is a serious

2545
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,488
Charge correct

2546
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:21,280
Crap

2547
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:22,304
And

2548
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:25,120
You knew it was a serious charge at the time

2549
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:28,704
Serious charges

2550
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,496
And that's why

2551
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:32,800
You felt like you needed to

2552
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:36,128
Established mr.

2553
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:38,176
Talbots credentials right

2554
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,456
Objection

2555
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:44,320
Anyone's credentials overriding.

2556
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:47,648
But you agree with me that you did not do that

2557
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,208
Article in which you

2558
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:52,256
Reported with somebody else was saying correct

2559
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,328
I don't check credentials for everybody I write about you

2560
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:57,120
But you did

2561
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:58,912
Yes

2562
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,776
And the reason you did it because you knew that these allegations were particularly serious

2563
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:05,568
Injection

2564
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,944
I thought he was bringing to the table so important

2565
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:14,272
Information that only a school safety consultant

2566
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:15,040
Supervisor

2567
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,112
Did it occur to you

2568
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,160
How

2569
02:22:21,184 --> 02:22:21,952
Families

2570
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:25,024
Who have lost loved ones at Sandy Hook would react

2571
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:26,816
To an allegation

2572
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:27,840
That in fact

2573
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,376
Their children

2574
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,400
Were murdered

2575
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:34,240
In an event that we scripted and planned over two-and-a-half years did that occur

2576
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:35,520
Objection

2577
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:38,848
Think about that

2578
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:39,616
Play why would you

2579
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:46,272
Yeah I'll be there they're not real but they're not real people say I am in Austin Texas working for Infowars

2580
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:47,552
And they are not there

2581
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:50,112
It's a solecism

2582
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:56,000
Also people might have heard what sounded like a gasp as you hiccuping

2583
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:58,560
Baby you did not have

2584
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:00,608
So the wedding

2585
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,376
Process

2586
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:05,472
Pretty light almost like the vetting process to get hired

2587
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:08,800
It turns out there's a parallel here

2588
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:11,360
Other than visiting the website

2589
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:13,408
Would you acknowledge mr. how big man

2590
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,456
But I can sell

2591
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:16,480
And

2592
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:21,344
Review me interview did you do anything further to investigate the claims that he made

2593
02:23:21,856 --> 02:23:27,232
Relating to the threatening conducted law enforcement officers and the scripted nature of the scene to go to bed

2594
02:23:30,304 --> 02:23:33,120
No I didn't I just published what he said in the interview

2595
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:34,144
Why

2596
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:41,312
And you're aware that shortly after you publish this article

2597
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,592
Mister how big

2598
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:44,384
Was

2599
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,664
Appeared

2600
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:46,432
On

2601
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,480
The

2602
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,504
Broadcast

2603
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:54,368
I got a call yet probably

2604
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:55,648
Bizarre

2605
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:58,720
So he did a little

2606
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:00,000
Looking around

2607
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:02,816
Go to the website that may be how they put up

2608
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:09,216
Self get well I made listen to that interview

2609
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:10,496
Let's see what looks good

2610
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:18,176
A guy named Robert Keith sent an email to Infowars it's at 8

2611
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:22,272
Maybe checking his credentials a little bit

2612
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:24,320
Cynodon wrote back to him and said

2613
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:30,720
Hey man it looks like he's got plenty of credentials to unspecific

2614
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:36,352
And have a long list of things of concern

2615
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:40,960
We talked about this on a bunch of the deposition episodes cuz it's come up in

2616
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:43,264
Rap song with Alex

2617
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:46,848
I didn't want to do like play it all over again

2618
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:50,688
But we got this discussion

2619
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,712
About the email here

2620
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,016
Followed up

2621
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:55,552
Is email to you

2622
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,088
With

2623
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,136
The results of

2624
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:03,488
Made online about mr. habits past correct

2625
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:06,304
Is that why yes

2626
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,864
And it seems as though

2627
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,888
He did

2628
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,168
According his email

2629
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:13,984
Quite a bit more than you did

2630
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,544
To investigate mr. Holland's background correct

2631
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:21,152
Directions to insulated more but it looks like he did a research

2632
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:26,528
Well all you did was visit one website that mr. helping himself may have created correct

2633
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:27,296
Direction

2634
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:32,160
He may have created I think I did a little bit more searching but

2635
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:34,976
Think it was made mainly based off of that one website

2636
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:37,536
Earlier today was that it was

2637
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:41,632
Adjust the website are you expanding that now to testify that you think you may have done

2638
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,424
Other searches

2639
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,704
Injection

2640
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:51,104
Recall what kind of searches I did for Mr howland's information other than that website but it's possible that I did do more

2641
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,128
Search

2642
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:59,552
I'd like to stipulate that I might have done something that makes you look way better

2643
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:05,952
Might have done I will I will save it if I were in add-ons position and the lawyer asks

2644
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:10,560
Is it fair to say that this guy with random guy emailing you did more work than you on the story you're doing

2645
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:14,656
If my lawyer didn't then object I'd be.

2646
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:17,984
A position where I would

2647
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,288
You're getting hanging out

2648
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:24,896
To dry that's what's happening if your answer that question

2649
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:27,968
Emails come in warning about how big's credentials

2650
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:29,504
Right as it turns out

2651
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,272
Albert

2652
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,320
Coming back on the show

2653
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:34,112
Did mr. Heath

2654
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:35,648
Email to you and Matthias

2655
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,416
Expressed

2656
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:38,208
Concern

2657
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
That

2658
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,024
He was not able to

2659
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,352
Find information concerning

2660
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:45,632
How big is activities

2661
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:47,680
Professional activities

2662
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:50,240
Call you to question

2663
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:52,288
Weather mr. halbig

2664
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,336
Could be reliable

2665
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,688
I think the point is bring it up or valid

2666
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:05,344
Yeah I think it probably maybe maybe made me question I can't recall how I felt at the time

2667
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:07,904
Okay

2668
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:10,464
Don't even recall receiving this email correct

2669
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,304
It's been so long it's been nine years so no I definitely

2670
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,072
Don't recall

2671
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,352
Receiving this email

2672
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:25,312
And you don't recall whether you raise mr. he's concerned with anybody else that enforce is that correct

2673
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,128
Recall doing that either

2674
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:33,760
If you had you suspect you would have forwarded your email wrong to whoever you wanted to notify about it

2675
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:37,088
Yes I probably would have yes

2676
02:27:38,368 --> 02:27:39,136
And

2677
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,536
Whatever

2678
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:46,304
You may have

2679
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,608
Done or not done in response to the email

2680
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,936
Mister haldi continue to appear on Infowars

2681
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:53,728
Aftermarket

2682
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,776
15th 2014 correct

2683
02:27:57,568 --> 02:27:58,592
I believe that is the case yes

2684
02:27:59,104 --> 02:27:59,616
And you don't

2685
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:04,992
Record whether you did any additional wedding of mr. how big your cell and response to receiving this email correct

2686
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:09,344
I believe I did anybody after this email now

2687
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:15,232
Boss that certainly shows that you care I think you misunderstood our process

2688
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,768
Siri see what we did

2689
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:19,584
It was we used him because his narrative

2690
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:26,240
Bolstered our own credibility and that was so we could make money oh no now I see why we're in trouble

2691
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:32,640
Honestly if the time we kind of figured that if anybody was going to get in trouble to be out

2692
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:41,600
Screwed up we're not good at law

2693
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,648
I mean

2694
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,440
Based on their choice of lawyers

2695
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,488
Real bad at law

2696
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:49,792
Yeah yeah

2697
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:54,400
Is clear evidence that there were people who were raising concerns that add-on

2698
02:28:54,656 --> 02:29:00,288
Had heard because he did respond to that email how big's credibility

2699
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:02,592
But there were other people

2700
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:06,944
Maybe even in fours and please who are saying you got to go to be careful

2701
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,784
Other than Mister did anybody else ever warn you

2702
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,552
About

2703
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:13,344
Relying on District how big

2704
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:16,160
In your reporting on

2705
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
Sandy Hook

2706
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,024
Maybe

2707
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,304
And I can't recall

2708
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,328
Possibly

2709
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:26,656
You know an individual named Robert Jacobsen

2710
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,448
Yes Robert

2711
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:30,240
How do you know mr. Jacob

2712
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,568
He was a video producer for Alex

2713
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:37,920
Did your work intersect

2714
02:29:38,176 --> 02:29:38,944
At Infowars

2715
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:42,784
Is down the hall from Mesa

2716
02:29:43,552 --> 02:29:44,576
Once in awhile WeChat

2717
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,880
When did he leave Infowars

2718
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:52,000
Miami 2017 or 2018

2719
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,304
Somewhere around there

2720
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:57,120
And when she Adam boards when you started in 2012

2721
02:29:58,144 --> 02:30:00,192
Collies for

2722
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:01,472
By 6 years

2723
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:02,752
Yes sir

2724
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:07,360
Did you have a friendly relationship with mr. Jacobson

2725
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,200
Are you in touch with him today

2726
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,528
You communicate with him

2727
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,552
I don't

2728
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:19,904
Did mr. Jacobson ever advise you of his concerns

2729
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:22,720
About relying on Mister how big as a source

2730
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:26,560
Or reporting at Sandy Hook with a script event

2731
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,888
Mr. Jacobson

2732
02:30:30,144 --> 02:30:32,448
I think dead raised concerns about

2733
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:36,032
But I didn't really regard them because mr. Jacobson has some wild

2734
02:30:36,288 --> 02:30:37,568
There is about a lot of things

2735
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:43,968
Oh he does he has wild theories amazing

2736
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:48,832
An incredible thing for a human being to say within which he's telling it

2737
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:55,232
Yeah he's telling me that maybe I shouldn't listen to this wacko about Sandy Hook being fake but I don't listen cuz he's got

2738
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:56,768
Weird cereal wacko

2739
02:30:57,024 --> 02:31:01,120
My job for this because I get into what those theories are

2740
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,424
And this is really unfortunate for add-on

2741
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:07,008
If your testimony is that Mr Jacobson raised concerns about

2742
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:09,056
Mister helbig's credibility

2743
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:10,080
But that you

2744
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:12,128
Ignore those concerns because

2745
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:13,664
He has

2746
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:15,712
She tends to have wild ideas

2747
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,808
Yeah I think Michelle Obama is a man so

2748
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:20,832
I'm in

2749
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:21,856
41

2750
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:25,696
Ann you've actually posted

2751
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:27,488
On your own social media

2752
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:30,048
Suggesting that Michelle Obama is a man having

2753
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:33,888
I've gone along with that conspiracy theory yes

2754
02:31:34,144 --> 02:31:36,192
Actually posted a picture

2755
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:39,520
Mr. and mrs. Obama kissing and saying

2756
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,824
Essentially happy gay pride day correct

2757
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,384
I might have done that I don't know

2758
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:47,200
So I guess you don't think that

2759
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:49,248
Mister Jacobson's

2760
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:51,808
View of that is

2761
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:53,856
Right

2762
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:54,880
You sure

2763
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:57,184
I entertained the theory but I don't

2764
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:00,256
I don't let spouse the theory

2765
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:01,536
In any event

2766
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:04,608
You discounted mr. Jacobsens warning

2767
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:05,632
Because

2768
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:07,936
You believe he held views like that

2769
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,752
Lizards

2770
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:14,080
Completely credible in my opinion

2771
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:16,640
He didn't give the warning and

2772
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:20,736
I didn't think much of it honestly

2773
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:26,880
So the best way you can really interpret this otherwise it's something that I couldn't even

2774
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:28,160
Imagine translating

2775
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,464
But the best way I can figure is

2776
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,024
What add-on is saying is that

2777
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:39,936
Rob actually believe that thing where is I'm willing to post this like trolling

2778
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:46,336
Post about it in order to push my transphobic and homophobic ideology

2779
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:48,128
Something that I don't even come

2780
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:49,152
Close to believing

2781
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:52,224
Because it spreads the hate that I wanted it

2782
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:55,296
Whereas Rob is crazy cuz I believe

2783
02:32:55,552 --> 02:33:01,184
Close to making sense of this as I can

2784
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:01,952
That

2785
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:08,352
Rob is crazy for believing the things that I say the things that we promote make money off of

2786
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:14,496
Might actually believe this.

2787
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:18,592
Either thing you got to know is none of us are actually believe the s*** that we say

2788
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:21,408
And Rob does that guy's crazy

2789
02:33:21,664 --> 02:33:27,808
I was invested in spreading Sandy Hook conspiracy theories and implying that it's fake because I needed to attack the

2790
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:33,952
Give that as a way to get around the obligation to make a human's in favor of guns

2791
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:39,840
Being everywhere the liberal I have a kind of second-order interest in it

2792
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:46,240
Where is I'm actually just manipulating the audience into thinking these things are real these concerns are

2793
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:47,776
Rob can't believe this stuff

2794
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:55,200
It seems like that's one of the readings you can make of this

2795
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:58,528
It's another rake in the face

2796
02:33:58,784 --> 02:33:59,552
Punch-Drunk

2797
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:05,952
From ber

2798
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,000
Why didn't I listen to this guy's warnings

2799
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:11,072
Because I did what do you want

2800
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:13,888
Adan expect

2801
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:15,680
That Maddie has

2802
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:22,080
Knowledge of this thing he posted on Facebook expect that

2803
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:25,152
Something that would be offensive to most people

2804
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:31,552
This belief that Rob allegedly has and then it is a crazy idea that Rob has

2805
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:35,648
Stated that he is not trustworthy he gets confronted with

2806
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:38,464
You believe the same thing I mean it's just

2807
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:42,304
It is just amazing it's just amazing for a human being to be

2808
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:45,376
Amazing because

2809
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,400
Rob

2810
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,704
When he was there

2811
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:51,520
Raising these concerns about Wolfgang

2812
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:57,920
It decided the best course of action would be to make fun of him

2813
02:34:58,176 --> 02:35:03,040
Your general recollection that he raised concerns about relying on mr. how big

2814
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:04,576
As a source

2815
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:07,904
The clean that Miss Bessie Nico prescript

2816
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:11,488
I believe I

2817
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:12,512
Brushed It Off

2818
02:35:13,792 --> 02:35:14,816
I might have

2819
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:18,400
For saying that

2820
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:23,008
Did you report his concerns to anybody else that Infowars

2821
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,288
No

2822
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:27,872
Do you recall saying in his presence

2823
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:31,200
That you wanted to have T-shirts and bumper stickers made

2824
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:34,528
Printed on those t-shirts and bumper stickers

2825
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:36,320
How big was right

2826
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:42,208
Have those

2827
02:35:42,464 --> 02:35:44,256
T-shirts are bumper stickers made

2828
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:45,536
No

2829
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:49,376
Did you say that because you believed in Jackman how big was right

2830
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:53,984
Not to like throw my

2831
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:58,080
Beliefs behind everything fully so it's the principle that he

2832
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:02,688
Could have been correct and I just know that it was getting under his under Jacobson's craw

2833
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:04,480
To say that he was right so I kind of

2834
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,784
Threw that in there

2835
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:09,856
As a joke

2836
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:10,880
But

2837
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,672
Also have serious

2838
02:36:13,184 --> 02:36:17,792
Repeat the joke but it's also kind of serious oh my God I'm trying to making this point but it's also joke

2839
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:22,144
I want to retire plausible deniability about this stuff but I also really

2840
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,936
I want the benefit to

2841
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:26,752
Five people thinking that I'm serious about it when they're available

2842
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:29,056
How is it that a human being

2843
02:36:29,568 --> 02:36:30,592
Can layout

2844
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:31,616
This

2845
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:34,432
Clear a pattern of behavior

2846
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:36,224
That you engaged

2847
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:40,064
That is so obviously everything wrong

2848
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:41,856
And not be like

2849
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,392
Now I got it

2850
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:48,256
You know going in that what you're doing is full of s***

2851
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:54,656
I think that moment of the constant banging your head against the wall

2852
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:55,424
All of like

2853
02:36:56,448 --> 02:37:02,592
You have these things that you were bringing up about anomalies yet

2854
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:05,408
Can appoint you didn't have a conclusion about the foreknowledge

2855
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,968
Like if he realized the

2856
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:10,784
Thing that was laid out about 911 at the beginning

2857
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,624
Avi like abbyland anomalies and it made me

2858
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,904
Totally

2859
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:18,720
It just there should be a mowers like

2860
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:23,840
That's what I want

2861
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:25,376
Dropping his bulshit like

2862
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:31,776
To me that's the moment that I really want is when you don't have to finally admit that you're an idiot might have boxed my

2863
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:35,360
Myself in space and make any stuff

2864
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:37,152
You did this to yourself

2865
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:39,968
A decade of working at Infowars

2866
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:41,504
Causes no prob

2867
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,808
Speaker

2868
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:50,208
Monitoring your work going for a follow-up question my integrity and the point doesn't matter

2869
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:56,608
When you're asked follow-up questions when you're at a place where people don't believe your nonsense

2870
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:58,912
You can't do it

2871
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:00,192
It's hard now

2872
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:01,984
Also this was really funny

2873
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:04,800
Because

2874
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:05,824
Result of

2875
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:08,128
Being said that Don is very

2876
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:11,456
Until relatively recently you had a

2877
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:14,784
Pinned tweet to the top of your Twitter account

2878
02:38:15,296 --> 02:38:16,576
Which was a link to

2879
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,112
You are first

2880
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:22,464
A article about Wolfgang halbig introducing him to the Infowars on his breath

2881
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:26,816
I don't recall 10 tweet about how big

2882
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:31,424
But maybe I don't know why I picked up the thing that on Twitter in 2018

2883
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:32,448
Are 2019

2884
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:40,128
Showing you exhibit number 19 a

2885
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,504
I say this

2886
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:47,296
The

2887
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:50,624
The page of your Twitter account correct

2888
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:51,904
Yes

2889
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:54,720
Okay and you joined in September twenty

2890
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:56,000
17 right

2891
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:57,280
Okay yes

2892
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:58,816
And then you have a

2893
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,632
Ken's tweet at the top of your account

2894
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,448
Which according to the page

2895
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:07,008
Posted on April 17th 2018 correct

2896
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:09,312
Yes

2897
02:39:10,848 --> 02:39:12,896
And you can see the

2898
02:39:13,152 --> 02:39:15,712
School shooting expert threatened over

2899
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:18,528
Sandy Hook that's the first article you

2900
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:19,552
Ever wrote concerning

2901
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:20,576
Mister help me correct

2902
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:21,600
Yes that's it

2903
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:23,904
At least as of 2018

2904
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:25,440
You were

2905
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:30,304
Beating your Twitter

2906
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,584
Landing page

2907
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:33,120
With an article in which

2908
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:34,400
Mister how big

2909
02:39:34,656 --> 02:39:36,704
Refer to Sandy Hook is a scripted event correct

2910
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:37,728
Objection

2911
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,544
A side

2912
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:42,848
In the Tweet to the top of my Twitter account

2913
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:47,968
April 17th 2018

2914
02:39:49,504 --> 02:39:53,088
And the link to an article in which Mr halbig refer to Sandy Hook

2915
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,624
As a script

2916
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,720
Yes the article

2917
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:01,792
Is about fix the one we covered earlier

2918
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,352
Boy

2919
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,632
Welive

2920
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:06,912
I guess I did

2921
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,936
Guess what did do that

2922
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:13,312
Why did I post that article in 2018

2923
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,592
Kennedy's Mike top

2924
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:15,360
Tweet

2925
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:21,760
On my account I'm starting to see a pattern of behavior here so you asked me a question and I answered

2926
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:25,088
And then whenever I answer it you pull out a

2927
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:26,624
Exhibit

2928
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:33,024
Proving the opposite or at least something different from what I said is it too late for me to blame this on them not training me

2929
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:39,168
Have you considered telling me what your exhibits are before you ask the question

2930
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:45,568
And I will be able to answer truthfully 831 last thing that come

2931
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:51,968
Adan writing the FBI

2932
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:54,272
He says no one was killed at Sandy Hook

2933
02:40:54,528 --> 02:41:00,672
Write that article that was one of the most popular stories ever drove a massive spike in traffic

2934
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:05,280
Wet all over social media was a huge thing for Infowars

2935
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:10,144
Yeah it was all just based on one table

2936
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:12,704
From a report that add-on found

2937
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:14,752
Somehow by guess

2938
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:16,288
Inure

2939
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:17,568
Barnacle

2940
02:41:17,824 --> 02:41:19,872
In which you reported that the FBI

2941
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:22,432
Had reported zero murders

2942
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:25,248
In Newtown for 2012

2943
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:37,536
You cited

2944
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:38,560
A

2945
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:39,840
A table

2946
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:43,680
From that report correct your call that

2947
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,728
It might have been table

2948
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:49,056
Okay that's 25b

2949
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:54,944
And I'll acknowledge

2950
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:58,528
Mr Salazar that because of the way this was PDF

2951
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:04,672
Iscar partly cut off on the left side but will be able to see what we need to see

2952
02:42:04,928 --> 02:42:05,952
You recall this

2953
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:08,000
The look of this graphic header

2954
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:10,304
You included that in your article does not

2955
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,888
And if you go down to

2956
02:42:18,496 --> 02:42:19,520
Page

2957
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:22,592
The Newtown row

2958
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:25,408
I'll concede that the end is cut off

2959
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,944
But if we can just accept

2960
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:29,504
For purposes of this

2961
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:31,296
That 0

2962
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:33,856
Are reported in that particular row

2963
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:37,440
Four murders and not negligent manslaughter for that year correct

2964
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:40,256
Yes I see that

2965
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:43,584
And that was the quote anomaly you reporting on right

2966
02:42:44,352 --> 02:42:44,864
Yes

2967
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:47,168
But you didn't look in any other part of the

2968
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:53,056
See if the deaths that occurred in Newtown at the Sandy Hook shooting weren't back reported in another section did you

2969
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:54,080
Jackson

2970
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
I didn't

2971
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:01,248
There would be another term for

2972
02:43:02,528 --> 02:43:03,808
What happened at Sandy Hook

2973
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,600
Murder wood

2974
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:07,648
In compass

2975
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:09,440
Don't think so

2976
02:43:10,976 --> 02:43:15,328
Any further four other other definitions are there other places

2977
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:19,168
And you didn't look any further to see whether those murders

2978
02:43:19,424 --> 02:43:20,448
We reported

2979
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:25,568
Under a different law enforcement organization that had jurisdiction to investigate them correct

2980
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:27,616
Jackson

2981
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:32,224
I only was reporting on what the FBI was saying in this report

2982
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:33,248
Well

2983
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:38,368
That's what I'm asking you questions report wasn't just table 8 correct there were other parts of the report

2984
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,416
Did you know that

2985
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,464
Objection

2986
02:43:44,768 --> 02:43:47,072
I figure there's 137 at least of

2987
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:49,632
Sabal lakes around 137

2988
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:51,936
Exist strawberry somewhere

2989
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:56,800
And you didn't think to look for Table 9 or people 10 or any other tables right direction

2990
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:01,408
Think my story was

2991
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:03,200
Mainly about table Aiden so I didn't

2992
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:05,248
Go through

2993
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:07,552
The entire list of tables at the FBI has

2994
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,600
So I was listening to this

2995
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:11,136
And it just

2996
02:44:11,392 --> 02:44:15,232
Kind of struck me how clearly this demonstrates that

2997
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:16,768
There's no curiosity

2998
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:18,816
Because curiosity isn't useful

2999
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:20,352
For someone like a dog

3000
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:27,008
Like when your job is to write a story about a predetermined thing curiosity is just going to get in the way

3001
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:32,384
In order to do the work that he has done and is doing

3002
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:33,408
You have to

3003
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,456
Actively not as Quest

3004
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:38,272
You have to actively not question event

3005
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:45,184
Your branding yourself in some way as like that we are out there you know we're questioning things literally

3006
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:45,952
Will you not

3007
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:46,720
Asking

3008
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:48,256
It's stopping yourself

3009
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:51,072
From asking a natural question

3010
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:53,888
That one would have upon finding information

3011
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:55,168
It's wild

3012
02:44:55,424 --> 02:44:58,240
I just I don't understand how they can

3013
02:44:58,496 --> 02:44:59,520
Like understand

3014
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:01,312
Not not that they don't understand it

3015
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:04,896
I understand how they can see how transparent that

3016
02:45:05,152 --> 02:45:07,200
What's interesting to me about that

3017
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:13,600
Is I feel like it's very similar to why they're so susceptible to being trapped in these depositions

3018
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:16,416
Is because the way their brain thinks is

3019
02:45:16,672 --> 02:45:17,952
They go into the forest

3020
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:20,256
They get their apple and then they go back

3021
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:21,536
Back home you know like

3022
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:24,096
You could put an apple underneath a box

3023
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:25,632
And I'm talking about this

3024
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:27,424
Now in real life

3025
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:33,824
You could put an apple underneath the cardboard box with a little thing attached and they be trapped every time they go in there

3026
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,384
The grab the Apple there be like go to Apple and then maybe try

3027
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,664
It wouldn't be hard

3028
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:39,200
They don't think

3029
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:40,480
Clearly

3030
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:41,248
Well

3031
02:45:41,504 --> 02:45:43,808
Words all of the things they don't think them

3032
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:44,832
Yeah

3033
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:46,112
I I just

3034
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:49,440
I wonder if it is just a thing of like

3035
02:45:50,464 --> 02:45:56,608
No one no one cares in their in their lives so why why would they think that anybody else would

3036
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:59,168
The see-through the thief

3037
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:00,704
The fake game that they're playing

3038
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:02,752
If he didn't have a real City

3039
02:46:03,008 --> 02:46:03,775
Innate somewhere

3040
02:46:04,287 --> 02:46:05,311
With deep within him

3041
02:46:05,823 --> 02:46:08,127
I really feel like his answer to those would be like

3042
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:14,271
Oh that would be a good idea to look for a table nine ironically I'm curious about this lack of curiosity

3043
02:46:14,527 --> 02:46:18,111
I am at where did it come from

3044
02:46:18,367 --> 02:46:21,695
Yeah but you really only was interested in that table because it made his Arkham

3045
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:26,815
You only went to the one table that a tipster

3046
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:28,351
I pointed out to you correct

3047
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:29,631
Injection

3048
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:33,727
I only went to the table that show their zero deaths in Newtown

3049
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:35,775
Right

3050
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:40,127
Have reason to know that that's what that table showed and I think your testimony was

3051
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,151
That

3052
02:46:42,431 --> 02:46:43,967
A tipster had provided it to you correct

3053
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:47,039
It was either attempt or something I found on social media

3054
02:46:47,295 --> 02:46:47,807
Okay

3055
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:48,575
And

3056
02:46:49,855 --> 02:46:53,183
You only wanted to go to that table because that's the table that reported

3057
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:54,207
0 deaths

3058
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:57,023
That's the only table that

3059
02:46:57,279 --> 02:46:59,327
Pertain to the story I was riding

3060
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:02,143
You were writing

3061
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:05,983
Reported that the FBI reported zero deaths in Newtown correct

3062
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:07,263
Yes

3063
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:08,543
That's why I

3064
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:12,383
When is the table light showing that it showed zero deaths in Newtown

3065
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:16,223
In and what you were conveying to your audience was

3066
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,015
This is an anomaly

3067
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:18,783
If

3068
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:22,367
There have been deaths in Newtown you would expect the FBI to Live recorded

3069
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,391
We're trying

3070
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:25,695
Back down

3071
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:30,815
Went out with that the FBI didn't back report them in a separate table in the same report

3072
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:31,839
Scrubs election

3073
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:33,375
Mischaracterize of the evidence

3074
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:35,167
You didn't point that out did you

3075
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:41,055
I wasn't aware that the FBI had reported the deaths elsewhere I don't know why they would not listen

3076
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:43,871
The death squared says murders in Newtown 0

3077
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:46,175
You don't know why they might do that correct

3078
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:50,527
It seems like it should all be listed in the table a

3079
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:52,319
An inverted you ask

3080
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:57,695
It will make any inquiry about whether those death may have been reported elsewhere in the same report correct

3081
02:47:58,975 --> 02:48:01,279
I didn't ask the FBI if that's

3082
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:02,047
Address

3083
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:03,071
You can ask anybody

3084
02:48:04,863 --> 02:48:08,959
Dangerously on curious and unserious person

3085
02:48:09,215 --> 02:48:10,751
That's bananas

3086
02:48:11,007 --> 02:48:13,055
I feel like he's now

3087
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:15,103
Completely unique person to me

3088
02:48:15,615 --> 02:48:17,151
I don't know how this person exists

3089
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:19,967
Like how do you get how do you tie your shoes

3090
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:22,015
My God

3091
02:48:23,551 --> 02:48:28,415
So did you think that there could be a table 9 or they could report it anywhere else I don't know why they would

3092
02:48:29,183 --> 02:48:31,487
You can answer that question

3093
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:36,607
You can go be like why would you even find the answer things that you don't know

3094
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:37,375
If

3095
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:38,399
They are

3096
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:39,167
Like

3097
02:48:39,679 --> 02:48:40,191
It like

3098
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:42,495
Necessarily in your interests

3099
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:43,263
It's a dada

3100
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:50,431
There's no reason to explore this because the only thing you could possibly find ruin the ability to exist

3101
02:48:50,687 --> 02:48:55,039
For your purposes which is what they want just come out and say yeah but it's pretty awesome

3102
02:48:55,295 --> 02:49:01,439
If I looks any further I would find out that I'm lying and I don't want to do that because I want to possibly deny that I'm

3103
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:07,839
Past the point of plausible deniability in trouble reading back-to-back

3104
02:49:08,095 --> 02:49:10,655
So speaking of emails I'm going to skip this next clip because

3105
02:49:10,911 --> 02:49:16,799
Is long and honestly I only kept it in for one reason and it's because he was an email that he sent to his cousin

3106
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:20,639
There's about the cyclist who are gone from Newtown to wash

3107
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:21,919
Intend to like

3108
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:23,455
Bring attention to Ghana

3109
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:28,319
And you sent an article about it in the subject headline was

3110
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:34,719
F*** the second

3111
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:42,143
Saudi subject comes up dismounting the Earth

3112
02:49:42,399 --> 02:49:46,751
Documentary that Infowars had promoted called we need to talk about Sandy Hook

3113
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:50,591
And here is a dawn sense of what happened there

3114
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,383
Familiar with

3115
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:57,503
The documentary we need to talk about Sandy Hook

3116
02:49:59,039 --> 02:50:01,599
I believe I tried to get through it was so long that I

3117
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:02,879
Probably just got through

3118
02:50:03,903 --> 02:50:05,439
30 minutes worth of it or something yeah

3119
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:08,255
Familiar with the documentary

3120
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:10,047
Okay

3121
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:12,095
And

3122
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:17,983
You didn't have anything to do with making a documentary did you

3123
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:22,079
Did you promote

3124
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:24,895
That documentary on your social media

3125
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:29,759
I can't recall

3126
02:50:43,583 --> 02:50:45,631
Infowars ever promoted that documentary

3127
02:50:46,655 --> 02:50:50,495
I believe I wrote an article about it when it was taken off of them

3128
02:50:51,263 --> 02:50:52,543
Jimmy H something

3129
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:57,663
I don't think we promoted it

3130
02:50:57,919 --> 02:51:00,223
Read about how my God be censured

3131
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:05,087
Juran disagreement

3132
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:06,367
With the fact that

3133
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:09,439
Platforms had chosen not to

3134
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:15,583
Well I did read an article about it I don't know if I express my personal opinion in that article

3135
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:18,143
Did you found

3136
02:51:19,167 --> 02:51:20,447
Know what the time that

3137
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:23,007
The we need to talk about Sandy Hook

3138
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,031
Documentary

3139
02:51:24,543 --> 02:51:25,567
Presented The View that

3140
02:51:25,823 --> 02:51:27,359
Sandy Hook back to curd

3141
02:51:29,151 --> 02:51:31,455
I figured that was a central tenet of

3142
02:51:31,967 --> 02:51:35,551
Of the documentary but I didn't watch it in its entirety so I

3143
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:36,575
What kind of hats

3144
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:38,879
Guess what that was what they were going for

3145
02:51:39,135 --> 02:51:42,975
So can I and you reported that in in your coverage of the van

3146
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:45,279
Eliza

3147
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:52,447
On December 2nd 2014 and forward posted the video of this documentary on their site with the sub-headline

3148
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:56,287
Documentary blows the lid off suspected Sandy Hook cover up

3149
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:59,615
The article includes events which sounds pretty laudatory

3150
02:52:00,127 --> 02:52:06,271
Quote a loose Coalition of concerned citizen journalist to known as The Independent Media solidarity of produced an in-depth

3151
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:09,599
Well research documentary regarding the countless anomalies

3152
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:13,951
Inconsistencies and discrepancies evident in the Sandy Hook school shooting investigation

3153
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:19,583
The video is a tell-all leave no stone unturned work that coalesces hundreds of data points

3154
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:21,887
Which researchers and laborious Lee spent

3155
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:23,423
Countless hours compiling

3156
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:30,335
That's really sounds like what you might write if a video is too long you couldn't even make it through the whole thing and you can't even really nail down with

3157
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,103
The point of it was

3158
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:33,663
Also the article includes this update

3159
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:39,551
A previous version of this video was removed from YouTube do to a copyright Claim by Lenny Posner

3160
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:44,927
Posner is reportedly the parent of one of the children supposedly killed at Sandy Hook

3161
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:48,767
Reportedly and supposedly both in that sentence is pretty over

3162
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:55,935
Go fuc yourself

3163
02:52:56,191 --> 02:53:02,335
And he should have watched the last 10 minutes of that documentary cuz they they go hahaha and then

3164
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:12,831
So Maddie is done with his questioning positions

3165
02:53:13,087 --> 02:53:14,623
Defense lawyer asked a couple questions

3166
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:17,951
Answer the first one has to do with that

3167
02:53:18,207 --> 02:53:21,791
Only using table 8

3168
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:24,095
There were some questions about

3169
02:53:24,607 --> 02:53:25,375
This

3170
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:27,167
Table8

3171
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:30,239
At the time you reviewed

3172
02:53:30,495 --> 02:53:31,263
Table8

3173
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:34,079
Back in 2014 did you have

3174
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,615
Any reason to

3175
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:40,223
Doubt that the number for Newtown a0 is accurate

3176
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,527
No

3177
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:43,551
That's bulshit

3178
02:53:43,807 --> 02:53:49,951
Madonna absolutely everything to question the interpretation of the table given here because the rest of the world was

3179
02:53:50,207 --> 02:53:52,511
Did in fact die

3180
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:59,167
There's a direct contradiction here in any curious person would see that table and it wouldn't really be a choice to question things

3181
02:53:59,423 --> 02:54:00,191
Reaction

3182
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:06,591
You'd start asking yourself things like how is this possible is there information on missing what's the context here

3183
02:54:06,847 --> 02:54:12,223
Is it possible for both this table to be accurate and the shooting happened as was report

3184
02:54:13,247 --> 02:54:15,039
The not questioning is actually a choice

3185
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:20,927
Adan is making any does that because he's crashed even an inch below the surface he couldn't make the insane claims that he does

3186
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:21,951
Make for a living

3187
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:26,559
He's woefully unqualified and doesn't have the tools to be in the role he pretends to be in

3188
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:28,607
Which is that of a writer and reporter

3189
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:32,447
That ability to turn off the instinct to question things when something

3190
02:54:32,703 --> 02:54:37,311
Conforms to your narrative while simultaneously yelling at your audience about how you're the people who question things

3191
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:42,431
That ability actually makes him a perfectly qualified to be an in-house liar it Infowars

3192
02:54:42,943 --> 02:54:49,087
So you better hope they don't go out of business cuz there's not many other games in town

3193
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:53,951
CCC the problem is all right I just misread it

3194
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:54,975
I didn't know it was

3195
02:54:55,231 --> 02:54:55,999
Table8

3196
02:54:56,255 --> 02:54:57,791
I thought it was table Infinity

3197
02:54:58,047 --> 02:55:04,191
Course I didn't think that one through seven imaginary number

3198
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:10,591
Also has a question about his research that he did about the car

3199
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:13,663
Qualifications presented by Wolfgang halbig

3200
02:55:14,175 --> 02:55:15,711
Switching over to mr. how big

3201
02:55:16,735 --> 02:55:17,503
There was some

3202
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:19,039
You have to have that open anymore

3203
02:55:19,807 --> 02:55:21,599
There was some discussion of

3204
02:55:23,135 --> 02:55:25,183
An email you received questioning his

3205
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:25,951
Credentials

3206
02:55:26,207 --> 02:55:26,975
Do you work all that

3207
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:29,535
Yes I recall it

3208
02:55:30,815 --> 02:55:31,327
Now

3209
02:55:33,375 --> 02:55:35,423
When you first wrote about mr. how big

3210
02:55:35,679 --> 02:55:36,191
YouTube

3211
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,471
One website

3212
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:39,263
Necessarily the entirety

3213
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,031
Your research

3214
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:44,383
I can't recall how much research I did I know that one website did

3215
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:48,479
Probably provide a majority of the credentials that I

3216
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:54,623
Is it possible you could have come across

3217
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:56,671
Say Orlando Sentinel

3218
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:57,951
Articles from

3219
02:55:58,207 --> 02:55:58,719
The 90s

3220
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:01,791
Referring to him as a director of security for Seminole schools

3221
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:04,351
Tomorrow if possible

3222
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:07,679
Could you come across an article

3223
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:12,031
In the LA Times mentioning time in the late 90s early 2000

3224
02:56:13,823 --> 02:56:14,335
It's possible

3225
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:15,615
This is

3226
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:22,015
Fishy I love it is it possible that you could testify better here

3227
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:22,783
Here use this

3228
02:56:25,343 --> 02:56:27,903
Excuse me my own witness

3229
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:34,303
Could you do a better job let me give you an update Jesus Christ better answer for you

3230
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:35,327
Wow

3231
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:39,679
If you would prepare for that then you would have had that in the can maybe

3232
02:56:39,935 --> 02:56:42,751
That's if your lawyer knows that then you should know that

3233
02:56:43,263 --> 02:56:49,407
Oh you know I don't know

3234
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:56,063
So we reach the end of this deposition of Adan Salazar and like I said

3235
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:59,647
Play a bit of the machine around Tampa

3236
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:06,303
No it's sense of Menace that I felt about his body of work a little

3237
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:12,703
But my mind The Wizard of Oz was revealed to be a puddle of mayonnaise that could

3238
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:13,727
Handle a lever

3239
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:15,519
Yeah

3240
02:57:16,031 --> 02:57:22,175
Maybe part of it was just because he was the one who was following us and then Sapphire was maybe that is kind of part of the

3241
02:57:22,431 --> 02:57:23,967
Yeah the minister felt but

3242
02:57:24,223 --> 02:57:26,015
I mean whatever the case I feel like

3243
02:57:27,295 --> 02:57:29,343
You know the way he answers questions the way this

3244
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:32,159
This is all processed is very sad

3245
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:33,439
Transparent

3246
02:57:36,255 --> 02:57:39,583
I think I'll necessary you didn't have to answer any of these questions help

3247
02:57:39,839 --> 02:57:44,191
Nope nope he clearly has a an interest in the company

3248
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:45,727
How many guy like

3249
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:46,495
Paul

3250
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:54,175
I think we covered his deposition that certainly I hate Paul Joseph Watson but we weren't is cruel about that because

3251
02:57:54,431 --> 02:57:57,247
He comported himself decently

3252
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,015
This

3253
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:58,783
Was

3254
02:57:59,807 --> 02:58:00,831
Get out there

3255
02:58:01,087 --> 02:58:03,135
There is obviously more

3256
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:06,207
Actions that add-on Salazar took in the past

3257
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:07,743
That are relevant to this case

3258
02:58:08,255 --> 02:58:09,279
And that is unique

3259
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:11,071
For his position

3260
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:12,607
As some being deposed

3261
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:14,655
But

3262
02:58:15,167 --> 02:58:18,495
There is such a refusal to accept

3263
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:19,519
Reality

3264
02:58:19,775 --> 02:58:21,823
In the like. Was making a point

3265
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:23,359
It's just a weird coincidence

3266
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:29,759
Stop it you're a child it makes it makes you lose a little bit of respect even as a

3267
02:58:30,015 --> 02:58:36,159
The Villa

3268
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:39,487
Whatever there's a way to do this but isn't

3269
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:45,887
Like we we just qualified again he failed to reach text a

3270
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:47,935
Like I'm going to try and obfuscate

3271
02:58:48,191 --> 02:58:51,263
Just enough like yeah I'll say yes or no but

3272
02:58:51,519 --> 02:58:53,823
Whenever they want to get me on something I'll be like

3273
02:58:54,079 --> 02:59:00,223
I don't recall or something like that that message

3274
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:06,623
Vested interest in questioning the reality of Sandy Hook had to do with my fear of them using it against like their stuff

3275
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:11,231
Damn can't be real how can you be so slippery

3276
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:13,791
About a bunch of these other things and then just

3277
02:59:14,047 --> 02:59:17,887
Give that would give it all away

3278
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:24,543
Anyway we have a bit more where this came from there's going to be coming up in the future

3279
02:59:24,799 --> 02:59:30,943
Cuz that's bottom feeders

3280
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:35,551
Immediately after being called a bottom feeder to then talk about Adan salad Salazar

3281
02:59:35,807 --> 02:59:37,599
Doesn't make me feel great

3282
02:59:37,855 --> 02:59:38,623
There are worse things

3283
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:42,463
Sure I mean

3284
02:59:42,975 --> 02:59:43,743
Another episode

3285
02:59:43,999 --> 02:59:50,143
In the near future

3286
02:59:53,727 --> 02:59:58,591
Someone's been

3287
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:03,199
But until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark

3288
03:00:03,455 --> 03:00:09,599
I run a Cooperative in my brain where people are free to squat

3289
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:17,023
Artist space sure right

3290
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,303
Where is acceptable right

3291
03:00:20,351 --> 03:00:22,399
I don't know what I'm saying

3292
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:23,935
What the sex robots

3293
03:00:24,191 --> 03:00:26,239
Holding

3294
03:00:28,287 --> 03:00:31,871
