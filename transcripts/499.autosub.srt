1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Soletic

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

5
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Hey everybody welcome back to

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
The fight knowledge I'm Jordan bombed

7
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
What is a podcast

8
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,864
Get together with my friends and we drink

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,240
Familiar Beverages and talk about anybody but Alex Jones

10
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Too bad right now there's pretty all right

11
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,456
Doordash that worships water

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Half half water only

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,744
Novelty 2A

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,376
That's how we all though it's not entirely sure he'll come up in some form or another

15
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
That sounds right yeah so Jordan congratulations

16
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Taking the wheel brand of these episode

17
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,664
Probably thinking like

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
Hey dude when they're just an election what the hell is going on about that whole election deal

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Set up front I want to say

20
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
Play I think that everybody would expect

21
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
Talk about Alex and the election that's why you got to go the entire

22
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Directions

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,592
The reality is that

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
I realize it is that blue 499

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
So on Monday will be putting out episode 5

26
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
100 100

27
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
I thought it was only

28
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
I thought it was only appropriate

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
Spiritually that are

30
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Podcast

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
Was born essentially out of

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,584
The election night on Infowars

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Really kind of makes some sense that we would have episode 500 be this election

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Some kind of a symbolic meaning if we did it

35
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,712
Today feels like we should both be like a bomb should land on us the moment after we

36
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Put out the 500.

37
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
I'm trying to imagine like other people do

38
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Who know what they're doing

39
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Ed orgeron

40
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Beige and they figure out what they're doing well before 500 episode yeah probably a lot of people there like we just did 50

41
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Episode

42
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
Congratulate ourselves retire

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
We did it

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
That will be on Monday

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
I thought it'd be fun also

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
It's going to be 500 episodes now have

47
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
P-51 the chicken over

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,600
And I feel like that's appropriate 1 out of 100 accurate

49
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Idea of our division

50
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Glyburide

51
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
And in general

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,912
It's possible

53
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,288
Another factor is

54
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Can suffice

55
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
No it's still a little bit a little bit

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,552
Unclear and I are covered people probably have a lot of better information

57
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
As a sorcerer

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
George Ryan I don't want to add to any confusion or risk

59
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Getting something wrong in the middle of this

60
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
Some black sort of Middle Ground on clear kind of thing

61
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
Right and I feel like we could just do a much better job

62
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
500

63
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
Take a video how are you

64
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
To do that but I have a very simple and obvious bright spot

65
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
Or listen to it yet but we put out a bonus after

66
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Episode where you did

67
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,023
Incredibly thoughtful and Incredibly nice things

68
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
And it was

69
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
It was a gentleman beautiful

70
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Sing Anna

71
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Really changed my my day in

72
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
The future

73
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,551
What is little less sentimental probably but things are going well with the worms

74
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,903
Bourne Farm is going but better than I thought it would

75
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Actually got a little mini chopper

76
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
Do chop up food remain

77
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
For just for the worst

78
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Chop up the worms

79
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,239
Two double no no no no no no

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
I think that's a name

81
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,103
I don't think that you can reliably do that never end

82
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
I just think you chop up

83
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,527
The food little smaller than they reproduce they'll they'll breed and then you'll have a large worm colony

84
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
And then I'll take over the world

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
Me and my worms

86
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,791
What is getting me through right now a little bit these nice worms

87
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,727
Exciting I'm not shiting on that I'm just saying that's an unusual thing to be like

88
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:08,127
That's what's really getting me through I mean pretty weird here

89
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,015
Words strange maybe Hobbies or interest

90
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Anytime you can have a lot of people who were forced

91
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Listen to like

92
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Closer quarters

93
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,535
Are some things will go viral in terms of hobbies like everyone got it just a weirdo

94
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,119
Sometimes there are things that are a little bit less

95
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Like Universal

96
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
I think worms are pretty cool

97
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
How do I put in bread

98
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
What time's right

99
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Whataburger

100
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Today the episode that I've

101
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Prepared for you haha

102
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Is personal it is

103
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
2 days

104
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Before the election

105
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Uncle decided

106
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Text me

107
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Clip

108
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
From the interweb

109
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,511
Okay all about how

110
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,071
Titled the real reason they want you to hate Donald

111
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Now

112
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Look

113
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
They sent that

114
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Each other

115
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,335
Email James my family believes in all that b*******

116
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Whatever go for

117
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Don't send it to

118
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,503
I wanted Tunes like a mistake I wanted to reach through my phone and slap

119
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
And while I was thinking about

120
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,647
Reaching through my phone and slapping him I realized that we do what show

121
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
And that's maybe the best way to reach through your phone and slap someone right I think yeah

122
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
Yeah I think so he sends me a text of like a six-minute video and I do an hour

123
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,775
Hour-and-a-half explaining why he's wrong about every

124
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Passive-aggressive

125
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
And that's

126
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
So that's what we are going to talk about and then we're

127
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
The same person

128
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
And also did a video just yesterday

129
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Okay long little

130
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Video about

131
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
How the hard-right feels

132
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,839
Right now so we're going to add a little bit of that into it as well

133
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,423
Do you know like his argument about why people want you to hate Trump

134
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Should still stand up

135
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
It would

136
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
If it were real

137
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
I mean I think we'll get to the bottom of that

138
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Being

139
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
The case

140
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
Before we get to add to that desert something else you need to do I was going to say thank you to some of our

141
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,135
I was about to get to that worried I'm sorry he's going to do the whole

142
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:32,255
First I'm sorry I was very excited cuz I was thinking about it while you were talking I was like

143
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,655
He's going to be blown away that I remembered to do this well I still haven't even though I even when I stepped on it

144
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Alright billboard

145
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
F.e. up helders

I'm a policy 170

150
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,511
Trading has never been no one has ever accused me of getting an A in calligraphy

151
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
That's true

152
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Well some people

153
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Adam Beach

154
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Unapologetically Adam

155
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,335
God dammit

156
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
Next we have Elizabeth wur now of Asia

157
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,807
Former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren

158
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Bet you would donate Morrison

159
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,951

I'm a policy wonk slept on

166
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
Soundbite absolutely and if you feel very very excited and very generous

167
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,391
I knew you would like to donate to our show please go ahead and go to our patreon page would be very happy if you did that

168
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Or what

169
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,815
Could do is you could take this generosity that you feel right

170
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
I can put it in a little box

171
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Senior living room

172
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
With a little bit of hummus and some coconut core and chop up a little food okay to feed that generosity bench

173
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
Shop that generosity in half and now it's to generosity

174
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Give those generosity worms

175
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
To a charity in your area show up and ruin it like 30 times

176
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
You know what let's see how this plays out

177
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Wrong move

178
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
Have you good clearly showed off

179
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
I am a failure

180
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
Episode

181
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:51,263
Go back to 500 episode the episode 500 I'm going to be replacing you Garden

182
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
With

183
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
I don't know if someone insults

184
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
And all I could come up with

185
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,015
I don't know why but the person I came up with was Jonny Fairplay hook Survivor

186
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:07,135
I think it was because I saw his face on Cameo I was scrolling through

187
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
I will not be replacing attorney

188
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
But yeah. Some people need that would be great

189
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
Be fantastic now we are going to talk about one fellow named Michael James

190
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Matt have you ever heard of him

191
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
Annabelle

192
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Matte

193
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
I don't know about people whose last names are first name

194
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
I don't know about that except for any of our listeners who that's the case

195
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
Michael Matt is tough

196
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Study hard

197
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
But I mean I guess

198
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
His whole life

199
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
You know a lot of kids are probably

200
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
The cruel

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
I will tell you this I very much doubt that he interacted with too many

202
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Kids outside of his feet

203
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
If you will

204
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
That'll be a surprise to

205
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Michael J mats

206
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
Is the editor-in-chief

207
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Of the I believe

208
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
It's called the Revenant

209
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Okay

210
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,695
Christian identity stuff

211
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Newspaper

212
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
And see the video that my uncle sent me

213
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
He was about the Davos

214
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,631
World economic forum

215
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
And he goes into this nonsense about how

216
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Covid is all about how they're trying to do the Great

217
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Reset

218
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
And he's doing the conspiracy theories about that

219
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
And I didn't want to rehash all of that stuff

220
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
Because that was the main thrust

221
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
So the little clips

222
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
That make you talked about that entire presentation

223
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
Find on their website already

224
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Yeah

225
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
That nefarious

226
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
Normal reasonable

227
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
What I found out

228
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
In looking into

229
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Was that it was not

230
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
The entire thing

231
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
Michael J Matt does a like weekly or bi-weekly show or whatever it is

232
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Shocks for about a half hour

233
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
About whatever bulshit

234
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
He wants

235
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Ramble on about

236
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
And whenever I went

237
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Through and

238
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Actually watched

239
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
The full clip

240
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
It was clear that they

241
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Edited the entire 20 minutes

242
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Down to the

243
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
The parts where he talks about Dave

244
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
And there's a whole bunch more

245
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
So I wanted to talk about why my uncle

246
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Call sent me this

247
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Dumb clip

248
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,519
Without all of the other problem at

249
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
And he didn't look into

250
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Whether or not there was problematic Mountain

251
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
It's going okay so your position is

252
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Okay alright

253
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,647
This is actually something that's probably

254
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,767
Maybe something we should do a little bit more of on the shopping site at that you came up with this idea

255
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Because there is something to these

256
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
He's kind of things that get sent around

257
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
The people would like

258
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
I hate to say that you're lucky

259
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Your uncle sent this to you but

260
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
And I think a lot of people are affected by those things and having a little bit of analysis

261
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
I might be something really productive for us

262
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
Hit episode 500 plus

263
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
But first let's hear a little out of context

264
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
It's all good ready to have bubbly person to draft

265
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,423
Michael Bloomberg

266
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Haydn

267
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Is not a serious candidate we can all agree on that right he's not serious

268
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:44,735
Not very serious enjoy

269
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
Enjoy having that little thing right there that was from the August

270
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
6 clip that my uncle

271
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
And just having that little pea

272
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
He's in there knowing what we know.

273
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Is very

274
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
It warms my heart

275
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Yeah this is a game like I think we talked about this every now and again took the pro wrestling strap

276
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Energy of like

277
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Building up your opponent while insulting them is important

278
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
Death because then if you win or lose you can still look good in Victory or defeat

279
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,295
If the person you're against is not a serious candidate and it doesn't matter and all this s*** like

280
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Doesn't really matter if you win if you lose

281
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
It's very sad

282
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
And he he spent a long time and what's interesting about this guy

283
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
Is he is a far-right

284
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Catholic and

285
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
He absolutely

286
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
He hates Joe Biden

287
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
For being calm

288
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Okay but not the right time

289
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
Is he is he a bad guy

290
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
No

291
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
He's very much a knot

292
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,943
That's what I mean what I said

293
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,271
No that's super and that's where his whole thing comes

294
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,855
Did bold like originates from the schism

295
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
That happened because of the Vatican 2

296
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
Because they said that the Jews weren't evil

297
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,191
Run into a few of these cats

298
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,311
So the first thing in the in the clip that my uncle sent me I start there

299
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
And that 6 minutes is

300
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Cut from

301
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
You know

302
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
The overall 25 minutes little bits here and there

303
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
Is it a presentation in front of people or is it a video he's recording for like a livestream okay

304
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,255
Made into the camera recorded video almost like sort of of

305
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Almost

306
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Exactly like that

307
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
He just opens up in this clip

308
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
With

309
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Well you might guess it if you're talkin about Dave

310
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Well almost

311
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Just one guy who's got

312
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
The power to do something

313
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Stop and you know exactly where I'm going

314
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
And I made a mistake

315
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
They tried to get Trump on there

316
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Science we invited Donald's

317
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
The Davos

318
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
A couple of times

319
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,135
But in January when Donald Trump I take really began to see the Beast that he was up

320
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Lexi went to Davos

321
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
That's in the world economic forum

322
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
And he

323
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
Stock a mega finger

324
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
In their eyes

325
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Mega thing

326
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
A mega

327
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
Wow which seems like a terrible

328
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
You could have

329
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,519
Tossed Maga finger in there so he's oh wow yeah they could have

330
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Also it makes me think of Dane Cook

331
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
Sydney have a mega finger or super finger or something I just remember him doing the leg

332
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
He got so many laughs from doing the leg

333
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,783
Alien

334
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
That was it

335
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
What I remember from Dane Cook some kind of an elevated version

336
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
Middle finger and mega finger makes me think of that

337
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,375
And I'm not I don't like either

338
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,191
Is upsetting about

339
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
Tossing the money changers

340
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
No

341
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
The reality is not that they asked him

342
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
He's been twice

343
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
The first time he went was in

344
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,271
2018

345
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
It was

346
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
His f****** idea

347
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
Of course he just wanted to go

348
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
To the globalist headquarters and be like

349
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
Didn't kick 2017 Bass

350
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,631
Look at all you dumb dumbs going around there they did not invite him to like

351
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Trick him into any kind of evil

352
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
They didn't invite him to be like

353
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
Wind when we're having

354
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
This conversation

355
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Really be like stay

356
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
Globalism

357
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Optical

358
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Your balls a little bit Google

359
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
You know that kind of

360
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
Enzo

361
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Was absolutely no one

362
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Trying to get on his side

363
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,111
And then as far as

364
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
The Whispers

365
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Speech was a

366
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Received

367
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
Steve Howard co-chair of the we mean business

368
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Coalition

369
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
I told Financial Times that

370
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
20 or 30%

371
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Applauded at the

372
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
The end of trump

373
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,823
That's not bad. That's not bad

374
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,711
720 is alright there now he said a lot of evil s*** and I feel like at least 40% of them would be on board

375
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Perhaps Perhaps

376
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,855
He's really interesting know you had these people who I was like

377
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
Forever demonize any kind of world government

378
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Soar like governor

379
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Body is the u.s.

380
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
The EU Davos

381
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Got a particular

382
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
World economic forum

383
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
So whenever Trump went and was

384
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
Appearing to be

385
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,799
Engaging in that process there had to be such a like explanation

386
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,663
For it is going there to take them all down from the inside

387
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,015
Yeah that's always fun weird about it is

388
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
He kind of

389
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,879
Did exactly what they wanted him to do a huh

390
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Explain it in a way that

391
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
Like they invited him

392
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
To trick him into doing the opposite

393
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,399
There needs to be more of a story

394
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,055
There's too much of like he was an ass holy crash their party if your

395
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Enjoy that too

396
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
I love the fact that he's a dick just accept it

397
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
He's he's

398
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
Sticking the finger in the eye of Davos

399
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
And this is of course when we get it

400
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
Oh do it so let's

401
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Surely after the speech

402
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
At the UN

403
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
Donald Trump delivered

404
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Why you think happen

405
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
The Coronavirus

406
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
Was Unleashed on the world

407
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
And Trump's booming us

408
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Economy

409
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Went on life's

410
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
You think I was an accident

411
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
I'm guessing he doesn't

412
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
He does not say

413
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,087
Just a pause there is you got it

414
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,951
Speaks volumes after after listening to several of these episodes I've decided

415
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
I think it's called like the remnant hours

416
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
Like that I've decided to call it

417
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
Michael J Matt and the rhetorical

418
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Does that sound right

419
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
Does it do you think that I think that

420
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
That is very such a soft

421
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
Strategy that is that is a very weak

422
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,783
Can you see it you see it around the tub

423
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
Could it possibly be

424
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Yeah

425
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
Just make a conclusion and stand by it

426
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Don't play this game

427
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
I will tell you about something

428
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,304
And this is what I found out

429
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
In in my Reese

430
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Search do you know what else

431
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
What happened on the

432
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
The same day

433
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
That's Trump gave that

434
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
Let's see let me see if I can guess

435
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
The first trailer for 10

436
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
It came out no no no I believe that was already out in like 28 I don't know

437
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Commercials

438
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
Tony Shalhoub won an Emmy over Stephen Roots hell yeah and that is why we have

439
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,000
I can tell you that right now what happened after that

440
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,424
Do you think that was an accident damn this is tough for me because I like both of those guys I like Stephen Root and I like

441
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Shalhoub

442
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
Marvelous mrs. maisel over Stephen Root for anyting, I know man Shalhoub

443
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Has Stephen Root ever won an Emmy

444
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't know

445
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,784
He deserve at least one at least one a lot of good work in his career

446
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,184
Yeah that stuff needed for like man in the High Castle

447
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
I make more sense

448
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,096
Yeah that's probably that any decision was probably what they do

449
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,704
I think so covid

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
I think that's just what happened silly

451
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
So do you think that was an accident

452
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
Yeah

453
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
No

454
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
No

455
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
What

456
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
So it's such a b******* cop out

457
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
Hate that

458
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Especially for people who purport

459
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
To be like I'm the mouthpiece

460
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Piece of f***

461
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
But I don't have the balls to even say what I want to say

462
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:06,496
Well if you see out of a lot of people who don't want to be nailed down to specific

463
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:11,872
Like things because if they do then they have to own it they have to argue it they have to argue the implications of it

464
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,224
And that can be kind of tough they can be kind of unpleasant a lot of people don't like doing that

465
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
It hurts people's feelings

466
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,040
Wednesday app

467
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
And

468
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
So he starts off with the

469
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Rhetorical question

470
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,464
He gets even f***

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,096
Hello again ladies and gentlemen Michael Matt coming to you once again for the offices of the run the newspaper

472
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Here's something you're not at

473
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
To hear on mainstream media

474
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,008
Probably 18 million people in the world

475
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Coronavirus

476
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
10 point

477
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
6 million

478
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Have recovered

479
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,272
You feel hear numbers like that yeah I forgot

480
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Those first two were from the 6-minute

481
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
Okay

482
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
They were the ones about

483
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,560
I was confused why is there a commercial break or something

484
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
That's the start of the actual show

485
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,192
Okay we start soda

486
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,544
This is August 6th

487
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
This year

488
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
So

489
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,432
That was back whenever the total number of

490
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
A cursory Google search

491
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
Would be like

492
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
How many cases

493
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Does are there on August 7th

494
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
18 belly

495
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
How many people have recovered

496
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
10 points

497
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
What is that f******

498
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
What you know

499
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
Like

500
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,120
No you can see

501
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
Subtract those numbers

502
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,008
The other thing that you might as well say that

503
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Here's what you want here in the heart rate m

504
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
Of the 18 million people who are infected with covid

505
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
7 point

506
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
4 million have not recovered

507
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Yeah same thing

508
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,320
Said a cyst in the other direction

509
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
Yeah that's some

510
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
I always I always wonder about that they the impetus to insist everybody's covering up everything that is just readily of

511
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Available information

512
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Yep I don't know

513
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
It seems strange here's what it said the first thing he says is

514
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
This here's what you won't hear from the mainstream media

515
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,336
And you absolutely will can and are often hearing it from the main

516
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
All the

517
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
And then as of today

518
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
There's about 49 million

519
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
It's okay and it's only going to f****** go up

520
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
So you

521
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,136
Gives a s***

522
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,768
Are you a doctor well

523
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,816
Is there you go

524
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
If you are a doctor I'd listen to you over this guy but you're not so

525
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:52,128
Would you like to know more about this guy you think you should listen to this guy after what I tell you I mean it's not going to shake my trust and

526
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,760
Well I will tell you that he is the editor-in-chief of the remnant

527
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
A far-right

528
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Catholic newspaper out of Minneapolis

529
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
Minnesota

530
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Newspaper

531
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Was

532
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,440
Created

533
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
When two brothers got into a fight

534
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
At The Wanderer

535
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
Wow those good things

536
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:14,912
Come out of that if everything

537
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Is the United States oldest

538
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Catholic news

539
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
It was started all the way back in like 18

540
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
67

541
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
And in 1899

542
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
A man named Joseph

543
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,760
Took over as editor-in-chief no relation

544
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Dare Wonder

545
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
Wouldn't that be lovely if there was no relation

546
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
So

547
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
It was originally German language only

548
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
Hey it wasn't until 1931 that Joseph

549
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
If Matt made it in English

550
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
Newspaper

551
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,632
And the reasons are not Jose

552
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
It was his son

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Walter

554
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
Who took over the editorship

555
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
In

556
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
And

557
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Over over that time

558
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
It went from being this

559
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Very small German Castle

560
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
What newspaper that

561
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Maybe three thousand people of red

562
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Do something that went

563
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
Worldwide

564
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Mainly because of

565
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Steve

566
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,952
Early

567
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Hatred of the

568
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
So even in the 1930s

569
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Joseph Matt

570
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
A a a

571
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
You know German

572
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Was just out here telling people to avoid

573
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312
He's a worst dude in the world

574
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,336
He was antifa

575
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,200
He was killing it to the point where f****** Mussolini had

576
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Pravda really some like faith

577
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,136
These guys The Wanderer absolutely

578
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Some serious s***

579
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,952
And then

580
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Vatican 2

581
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
I am so

582
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Walter

583
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
And his brother Alphonse

584
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Who were both working

585
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
Walter being the editor-in-chief at

586
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,728
The time Alphonse working at

587
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
The Wanderer

588
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
Decided that

589
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
One of them

590
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Really was fine with Jews and non-catholics

591
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,664
Extend the other one

592
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,712
Not fine with using not sure

593
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
And so

594
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Walter Matthau

595
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
God created the

596
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,160
Which was a newspaper that basically exists only to tell you

597
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
Why the Jews and non-catholics a refund

598
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
Oh boy

599
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
The Pope

600
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
No one who is Catholic

601
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
Is Catholic to the red

602
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
The case with a lot of those

603
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
The folks who

604
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,920
Believe that they did the Vatican is now invalid

605
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,248
Except for

606
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Our friends group

607
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Everything we are the only ones keeping

608
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
In the fire

609
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,672
Isn't it I always find it amazing how

610
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
Solid a voting Bloc

611
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Christians are

612
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Quote unquote Christians are

613
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
When if you

614
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
Like get granular

615
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
They hate each other more than anyone else

616
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
There's a lot of infighting

617
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
Between sack

618
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
That is true

619
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
That is true

620
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Because a lot of it for the people who get

621
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,408
Who does mortify tsp

622
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
Vivitar very apocalyptic

623
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
They're very into the fact

624
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
Or the idea that they have that it's going to come down to

625
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,112
Popular games

626
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
They they

627
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Yeah it is very it's very much

628
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
Important that your groupie the one

629
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
It has the right idea.

630
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
And the tradition is

631
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
The traditionalist Catholic

632
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Pixar

633
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Nut bags

634
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
Walter Michael J map

635
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
Took over after Walter map

636
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
From the remnant

637
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
And of course

638
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Michael Matt

639
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,664
What's first cousin

640
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
The Junior

641
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
Is editor of the Wonder

642
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,808
So these guys are third-generation

643
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
Catholic b******* newspaper

644
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
Editor but also vicious

645
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,744
Austin Minnesota

646
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Oh wow

647
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,912
That states not big enough for these two newspapers I don't know

648
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,216
Has been labeled a hate Group by the splc

649
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,592
I think the smart money is on this guy to be correct

650
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
So

651
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
Keeps going on about covid

652
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,480
And this is all in the full video the stuff that

653
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,504
You know you don't get

654
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
Email address

655
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
Friends with Avatar

656
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,952
I mean let's be really clear right from the outset

657
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Covid-19 is not a hoax

658
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Okay

659
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,656
Worldwide over 650,000 people mostly elderly halves

660
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Succumb to it

661
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,448
This is not a hoax

662
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,544
Even with skewed death reporting which we know is going on all over the

663
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
The place

664
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,104
This is a very serious virus

665
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Okay

666
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
You got you got to give it up to him

667
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
Whatever is right now you do numbers look they're all going

668
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,856
To say that but at least he's on the

669
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
Take this season actual thing

670
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
This is a serious

671
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
It's not like

672
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,048
Applaudable that's just a demonstration of how

673
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,376
Far out like so many of the people that we talked about our

674
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,216
We're looking at him and he thinks it's a real virus is notable

675
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Yeah the only thing

676
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
Credit where it's due for the harbor

677
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,432
Widow with the low bar that we're dealing with

678
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,480
Then how long do you think that credit

679
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Maybe this next clip

680
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
But so was the H1 N1

681
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
The swine flu of 2009

682
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Which claimed the lives of a

683
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Half a million people

684
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,816
So was the Hong Kong flu of 1968

685
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Which claimed the lives of up to

686
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
24

687
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Million

688
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
People

689
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Flu is a nasty business

690
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Have you remember these

691
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
Previous epidemics pandemics probably not why because the media

692
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Didn't freak us out over those

693
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
The Country Wasn't shut down

694
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,528
Healthy people were not quarantined

695
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Schools weren't

696
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Close

697
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
Church services

698
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Weren't cancer

699
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
Sure

700
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
Sure it's a real

701
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,792
We've had viruses in the past

702
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
Remembers them

703
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,376
I think people do

704
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
I mean I'm sure if you related to one of those 500

705
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
Thousand people

706
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
Oh I remember that one

707
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:15,616
He just went through it that's not even get it I'm ever h191 I didn't

708
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
I don't know anybody

709
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
Off the top of my head

710
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
They got sick but

711
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
What is point

712
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Exactly

713
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
His point is

714
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,696
The media it's nothing to worry about Serie media making everything right

715
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
So I looked into those and as far as H1

716
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
He

717
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
Kind of

718
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
He's misrepresenting things a little

719
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
The CDC total is in

720
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Estimate that gives it

721
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
Between 140

722
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
N500,000

723
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
So

724
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,688
That's a pretty wide margin to just assume 500,000

725
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Sure

726
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Even more

727
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Maybe to his

728
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Beat United

729
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
How about 12,000

730
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,416
Nodal

731
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,440
From

732
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
H1n

733
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,536
So if you want to say why don't we remember those

734
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,096
Because it didn't lay waste

735
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
2

736
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
100000

737
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
Why why didn't we respond the same way to those it's because different decision for event

738
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,640
Viruses exist and we did a much better job

739
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
Haha just frankly overall width

740
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
Contact tracing with

741
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,736
With every

742
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Taken serious from

743
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
Within two weeks of the first H1 N1 case in the United States

744
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,208
It was being absolutely attacked

745
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
Now the 1968

746
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,560
Quote

747
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Hong Kong

748
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
If he calls

749
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Which is

750
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:47,264
Is racist then as it is now but you know

751
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,360
That one is actually kind of interesting and also

752
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,640
Instructor

753
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,176
In terms of this types of

754
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:59,552
So it was actually a strain of bird flu called h3n to

755
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,136
Two-story actually begins in nineteen

756
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
57

757
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
In

758
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
The southwestern province of Guangzhou

759
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
H2n to broke out

760
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,656
And by 1959 over a million people had died

761
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
Hey between Asia and

762
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
A vaccine was created

763
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
In just two years

764
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
And the outbreak was dimmed

765
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
But even in 19

766
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
58

767
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Ireland had to close schools

768
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
Britain recommended quarantine

769
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
1960

770
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
C8

771
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Finally

772
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
The

773
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,648
H3n to

774
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
The h2n to

775
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
Created a new

776
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,376
It basically mutated it it reconstituted

777
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,168
Itself right into h3n

778
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
And this was

779
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Maybe the first

780
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,520
Website that when

781
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Global

782
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Because of

783
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Air travel

784
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
The first dryer is not website

785
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm losing my mind it's alright I was

786
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:05,600
Is reading the the next note while I'm there I'm not I'm not good at reading notes while talking at the same time

787
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
Websites can go viral so I feel like I understand where the

788
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
So yeah that one

789
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
Went crazy

790
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
Now here is what happened

791
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
When h

792
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
3M

793
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
To hit the United

794
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,544
From the National Library of Medicine website

795
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
All 50 states experienced increased School abs

796
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Absenteeism during the

797
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Pandemic

798
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,016
Make sense 23 face school and college closures

799
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,344
31 saw elevated worker absenteeism

800
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
All of this stuff

801
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Was

802
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Chronicled

803
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Tentatively

804
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,024
In every newspaper where their work

805
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
Obvious

806
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,072
Ali College closures

807
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
Business has slowed down

808
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:53,728
People were screaming about threats to Christmas mail people were screaming about the

809
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,288
Economy and how this is all going to happen

810
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,152
In December Apollo 8 astronauts in Apollo 8 astronauts were vac

811
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Fascinated

812
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,712
From getting a space virus

813
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,272
The whole f****** thing

814
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
All of this

815
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Even during that time

816
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
President Lyndon B Johnson

817
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,464
At one point he was hospitalized with a respiratory infection

818
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
That could be called

819
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
The flu

820
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
All of this stuff

821
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,376
As described by the New York Times

822
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
As one of the worst

823
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
Pandemics in the nation's history

824
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,568
And we responded in a lot of very similar ways it turns out

825
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
All of that stuff

826
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,736
Was was done and it was done in both kind of a half-assed way and in very serious

827
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,808
Say that the media did not freak out about

828
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Would be

829
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Wildly

830
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
Yeah yeah

831
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
This guy is bad point exactly

832
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Furthermore

833
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
3 + 2

834
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
Was reported after multiple

835
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,912
Do you have a mortality rate of about

836
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Half a percent

837
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Covid

838
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Overbuff

839
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Average

840
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
Is about five times higher

841
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
And at high risk

842
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,920
Community category

843
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
10 times higher

844
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
There's so much

845
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,672
We know more now than we did six months ago or whatever but there's still a lot of unanswered

846
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,232
Questions about stuff that makes it much

847
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:24,096
More difficult than a lot of things that are much more closely related to a flu

848
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
That we have

849
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
A lot more history of

850
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
Of being able to

851
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,240
Have an event

852
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,520
Some treatments weather

853
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
But the things that I keep

854
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Keep going back to

855
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Is

856
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
And this is the thing that I

857
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
I just wish more people would understand

858
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,224
The quote

859
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
Hong Kong flu

860
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Didn't start

861
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,832
Until 19th

862
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
But it mutated from it

863
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
A different virus

864
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
In night that started in night

865
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
1950s

866
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,608
So whenever people talk about immunity and all of this s***

867
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
All of that nonsense

868
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
It's like

869
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,448
This is not about just

870
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
Today how about just

871
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Visvi

872
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
This

873
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,872
This is not something that we can allow to continue to prop

874
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152
Navigate simply because it's

875
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
Going to adapt on its own

876
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Exactly

877
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
How they survive longer you f****** allow it to roam what is now essentially on check

878
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
The more we

879
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Almost certainly guarantee that

880
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
There's going to be another pandemic shortly

881
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Yeah yeah

882
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,888
That's just how handling works

883
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,448
Give rise to higher in

884
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Higher likelihood of

885
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Pandemics if if not

886
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
Dealt with appropriately

887
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,712
I can't back that up with any any research because I'm just talking off the top of my head

888
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:50,112
Welcome to my job by Brent

889
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,208
But I really don't know if it's true

890
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,560
Conversely I don't like it

891
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,120
If you're very untethered

892
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,912
Despise having to know what I'm talking

893
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:06,752
Think about it's really freaking me I come if you a little bit more secured but

894
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
So yeah

895
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
Why don't we remember stuff like that

896
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
Because assholes like this dude just say

897
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
Why don't you remember instead of

898
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,760
Going back in talking

899
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,088
And talking about how they're these parallels

900
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
And things that we can learn

901
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
From Oliver

902
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Coming to right now

903
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
The people don't remember these

904
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Yeah yeah

905
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
There's a big difference between remembering

906
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:39,264
That something happened that actually understanding what happened

907
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
In a report like this

908
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,128
Little bit I remember the name

909
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
I don't remember what we did

910
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:50,016
But it seems like the media probably wasn't all that up in arms about it super freak out

911
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
Let's move on

912
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
Okay that's a good idea

913
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Which case

914
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,744
This is something I would like to move on to Dan pika

915
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
In this situation I am going to need your help

916
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Everyone with a pulse nose

917
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
Joe Biden can't do this job

918
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
What's he doing there

919
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
In my opinion he's

920
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
The personified Monument

921
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
To the US Presidency that the mob will

922
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
Tear down in January

923
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
They need to reset everything

924
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Including the politics

925
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
Sub United States the governance of the United

926
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
Midstates

927
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
Besides that old

928
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Joe the Catholic Bible

929
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
Is always been a new world order guy

930
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,560
The affirmative task we have now

931
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
Is is 2 actually

932
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
A creator

933
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
Anu

934
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
World Order

935
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Oh boy

936
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Oh boy

937
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
Oh no

938
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
So here's a here's the thing

939
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
Alright I understand what he's trying

940
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
He's trying to say biting is bad

941
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Yeah

942
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
What is he actually trying to what is he actually saying

943
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
He's saying the Joe Biden

944
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
Sucks either bad kamp-rite is why they're running him as a sacrificial lamb

945
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,584
Once he becomes inaugurated to be taken down will take down with it

946
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
The entire

947
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
3-part

948
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
United

949
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
States government

950
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,264
Imbalances

951
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
Check up with words government create something better probably

952
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
Some kind of demonic socialist

953
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Organization

954
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
12 workers

955
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,064
He is not

956
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
This is

957
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
Is completely out of left

958
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,440
This is in the middle of him talking about

959
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
All of the

960
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Covid

961
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,608
Get your ready for Biden

962
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
To come in and then

963
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
Get him take

964
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Can down

965
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,984
And then completely changed the United States

966
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
Send to

967
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,360
Helltown Venezuela or whatever the right-wing likes to yell about

968
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
I just don't

969
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
Is the statue that they're going to

970
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
To take down

971
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,831
And he's trying to say if you're if you're right he's saying that the mob

972
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
Yeah the left

973
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
Allah has chosen

974
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Him

975
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
To then take him down

976
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:06,975
No

977
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
No their establishment

978
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,375
Has chosen him because he is vulnerable to being take

979
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
Down by the mob

980
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:20,031
Who the establishments order controls but maybe they don't sometimes if we need them to not

981
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,359
He'll be so weak

982
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
Take that the mob will take him down

983
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,271
And the establishment Will Forte

984
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:35,647
Okay so that's the real reason they want you to Hector's become

985
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
What are you f****** talking about

986
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
I don't know why would anyone run a candidate

987
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,839
Well I mean like I would also say

988
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
I'm sick and tired of hearing these people who have

989
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Eclipse

990
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,007
Of them saying the words New World Order

991
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,335
I do not find this a compelling argument at all

992
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
Play New World Order it's all if any fee says that they're like it's the one that we want

993
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,295
Create they would make the argument that I would make

994
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,903
About everybody talk about a world order that is not

995
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
The same as the old

996
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Way of

997
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
Things being organized alliances

998
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Tension

999
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
Things like that pink disagreement

1000
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,935
It's between country exactly new way of ordering

1001
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Bring the world

1002
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
Collaboratively

1003
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,359
Cooperatively that's what they would say if Trump saying

1004
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
Passwords

1005
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Assertive benefits

1006
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,831
No not very dumb always been New World Order

1007
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:42,463
Totally as opposed to Trump who is never a new world order guy because he's always wanted things to stay

1008
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,743
Exactly the same

1009
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,535
I believe that Corn Pop

1010
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
Actually got to abiding into the New World Order

1011
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,495
Really that's what I understand that's his other got this guy's other speeches iHeart

1012
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,335
Ducted him he did speak at a trump rally may have said that one that one.

1013
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Hellboy

1014
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,199
So he tosses that out there and then almost immediately goes

1015
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
Right back to

1016
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
The great reset

1017
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,111
Then politically economically it wants to implement massive

1018
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
Socialist

1019
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
Program so course global

1020
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Climate change

1021
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,231
Along the lines of the green New Deal

1022
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
The regulations

1023
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
The unbelievable

1024
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
And no one no country

1025
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Will be allowed to opt out of

1026
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
What is why

1027
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
William individual country

1028
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Apps out

1029
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
The great reset

1030
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,567
They're going to be endangering the whole world Community the whole world

1031
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
Future pandemics it will be

1032
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,895
Because by climate change

1033
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
Al Gore says

1034
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
Hanover population

1035
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
Says Bill Gates you see how it works

1036
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
No country

1037
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Will be allowed

1038
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
To opt out

1039
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,879
This is what we're facing in November

1040
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
So this is what covid is

1041
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Creating

1042
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Cuz it's attacking

1043
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
Every kind

1044
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,583
Right every no country will be allowed to off

1045
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,655
Right that's the idea behind all of this

1046
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
And just because you say something with

1047
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
The funny voice

1048
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,799
Doesn't mean it's not still true

1049
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Like

1050
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,431
There's no agreement and I'm sure that whatever agreement they do wind up working

1051
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
Yeah but they

1052
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,295
It's a terrible idea

1053
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Yeah

1054
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,599
Because it's a global

1055
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,695
The entire and this is something that we learn from 1968

1056
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,487
Talking about air travel

1057
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
It goes

1058
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Every

1059
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
All of this stuff goes everywhere which means everywhere has to

1060
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
To fight against

1061
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
Yeah things that are human constructs

1062
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
Can't fight things that are just real

1063
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
Like a border can't fight

1064
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
A disease

1065
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
You know like even if you have

1066
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,943
Even if you have a tightly-controlled wall and everything like that

1067
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,039
Still vulnerabilities that you have you know you're never going to be able to

1068
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,063
Completely

1069
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Insulate

1070
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,391
Yeah totally

1071
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
And there you are

1072
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
Like whenever they talk about how we need to

1073
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
Deal with climate change in order to keep all of these things

1074
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,375
Taking care of that is also going to have to

1075
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
Be a global effort

1076
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
You nobody can opt out

1077
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Pollution here effect

1078
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,519
Places that other than here

1079
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:04,799
Absolutely

1080
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
So

1081
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,871
Just cuz you can't just be like

1082
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,711
Oh yeah everybody has to stay in there and then be like okay well then

1083
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
You got me

1084
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,623
Yeah I mean I guess if what he was talking about was some kind of alike authoritarian rule of the planet

1085
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,695
I guess I would probably be opposed to that

1086
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
But if it yeah if it's just

1087
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
Working

1088
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,167
Together working together to fight climate change

1089
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,495
I don't think that there's a real problem with centralization

1090
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Unified response

1091
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,383
I don't see that being the same thing the wavy

1092
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
These guys do

1093
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Absolute

1094
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
And we're all we are

1095
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Climate change

1096
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Pandemics

1097
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
All of the stuff

1098
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
And I was going to ask I want to ask you a

1099
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
Do you think

1100
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Think that the cats

1101
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Church is going to put

1102
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Me

1103
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,559
Probably not

1104
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Anything the cat

1105
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Catholic Church

1106
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Is going to protect you from what

1107
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
Coming from this globalist

1108
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
Take over

1109
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Nightmare

1110
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Think again

1111
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
We've been through all this

1112
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,383
Leaving aside pachamama

1113
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,943
Leaving aside laudato C

1114
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,479
Which is the encyclical

1115
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
The globalist

1116
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,295
16 cyclical of the United

1117
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,343
He's using the G word oh yeah

1118
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,903
Yo we're talkin about globalists

1119
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Guess who's one of them

1120
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,231
It's the pope buddy

1121
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,327
As soon as soon as people started calling him Culpo

1122
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
News 12

1123
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
And if you

1124
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,727
Do you know what pachamama is

1125
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
I was a little bit lost

1126
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,799
For a minute for the love. Tosi

1127
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,823
Please

1128
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,687
Explain so pachamama whenever he just tosses out pachamama I really

1129
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,991
Struggled to figure out what it was that he was soaked

1130
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Concerned about

1131
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:54,367
It seems my radar is up for something about

1132
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Here's what's going on

1133
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,511
In 2019 in October

1134
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
There was a

1135
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Indigenous prayer service

1136
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
In the Vatican Gardens

1137
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Okay

1138
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,191
And in that

1139
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
Vatican guards

1140
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,823
There was brought a an Amazonian female fraternity

1141
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Fertility

1142
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,639
Names

1143
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
Okay and it was just there

1144
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,575
And that of course was the signal to everyone that the pope was actually a pagan

1145
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,599
Andaz

1146
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
Is been trying to destroy the church from the insides checks out

1147
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,511
Yep yep I got to say they've done their homework.

1148
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
And then the love. Tennessee

1149
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,887
Was an encyclical from the Pope

1150
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
In 25

1151
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
And

1152
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
An encyclical is something that's been

1153
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,543
An added to the church

1154
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Executive order

1155
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,383
Sickly yeah

1156
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Says it because

1157
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
The pope is the mouthpiece

1158
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
God if he's saying it

1159
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,135
Well it turns out that believing that the pope is the mouthpiece of God is not something that Catholic

1160
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Looks really do

1161
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,463
They're not really fans of that whenever the Pope

1162
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Disagrees with

1163
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
So

1164
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,839
Dlive. Tosi was essentially this

1165
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,887
I'm going to sum it up for you very very

1166
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,983
You know all those reasons that you and I think the world is f*****

1167
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
Instead of having religion fights

1168
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Science over

1169
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
What are widgets

1170
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Okay

1171
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
How'd that go

1172
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
I'm fine

1173
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
With that

1174
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
Michael J Matt and his friend

1175
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,343
Instead heard that and went

1176
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Witches

1177
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Science witches

1178
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
I'm so all of this stuff

1179
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Again

1180
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Not really in the video that

1181
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,119
My uncle sends around

1182
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,447
Through this guy that he's a weird Auntie papist Catholic

1183
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Who's been fighting against

1184
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
Including Jews in like

1185
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Public

1186
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,871
Spaces for his entire life

1187
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,223
You would want to hide

1188
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Because you're trying to get this person the mess

1189
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
Message out

1190
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
About

1191
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
Davos

1192
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
A little bit different is

1193
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,695
And so we continue on

1194
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,559
Francis has already announced the global economic reset of his own last

1195
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
You're I don't know what makes this man thinks it's Anthony's in a

1196
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Economist

1197
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:19,007
I don't know where he learned all of this town and Argentina but he's an amazing guy he knows everything but

1198
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Theology

1199
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
I didn't notice

1200
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,175
All that close of attention so I hadn't notice

1201
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,735
Well I will tell you one reason

1202
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
That

1203
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Is knows a lot more about the

1204
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Michael J Matt

1205
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Princess back

1206
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,743
Used to be cardinal bergoglio

1207
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
All right before 8

1208
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
And he was

1209
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
The cardinal

1210
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
And he was the Archbishop

1211
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Venezuela

1212
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
During the

1213
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
A f****** car

1214
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Collapse

1215
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
Whenever inflation went in so he did it

1216
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,919
I didn't do it okay

1217
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,759
Venezuela

1218
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,319
Is mentioned

1219
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
I am sure he is

1220
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
I wonder why

1221
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
So the reason that I will trust him far more than

1222
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Michael J Matt

1223
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,071
Is because when all of that one

1224
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
Cardinal bergoglio

1225
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Oglio

1226
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Decided

1227
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,215
F*** all of the Trap

1228
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,519
I'm going to live in a small home

1229
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
I'm going to walk to work

1230
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,591
I'm not going to take a f****** limousine

1231
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
When everyone around me is

1232
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:32,479
So I will immediately trust somebody who is willing

1233
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
To supper along

1234
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
More than

1235
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
Damn near anybody

1236
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
It seems to be a good

1237
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Indicator of

1238
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,463
Yeah it seems like

1239
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,511
There was somebody really important

1240
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
Into the Catholic Church who

1241
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,887
Spoke almost exclusively about doing stuff like that

1242
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Yeah he's really important

1243
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
Into I can't remember his name

1244
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
Nobody took my tell somebody was like that's the only way to get to heaven

1245
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:06,271
If you have all those trappings you're never going to heaven or whatever the f***

1246
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,367
Who said that somebody really Thomas Jefferson Airplane

1247
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:17,023
That's the end of that August show that's what I'm going to play from there obviously you can guess the Davos hits

1248
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
Zoroaster

1249
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:23,167
Go ahead with the great reset it's really interesting because you have this

1250
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
Staying about the world economic forum

1251
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
And a lot of like ideas about

1252
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
New technologies in Waze

1253
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,639
Is that they can be implemented to help with climate change and things like that

1254
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,223
And meanwhile you have the people who are like the really

1255
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,015
Paranoid conspiracy types

1256
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
With d like a

1257
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,159
The global economic reset nesselrode jasirah stuff

1258
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,207
BBQ communities

1259
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
And I don't think that they think that they're talking about the same thing

1260
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,607
But they're playing with the same idea

1261
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,935
They're playing their paranoia comes from a very similar place

1262
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
I think that's really it

1263
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,007
Wearing a suit

1264
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,823
And the other has a sign it is yelling on the corner

1265
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
And I bet it's pretty much the same

1266
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
The same b*******

1267
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,735
Just packaged in different ways for what audience that you're looking

1268
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:15,135
This guy

1269
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
There you go that's how it works

1270
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,559
That's the end of that episode end this next one that I pulled clips from is from

1271
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
What would that be Wednesday November

1272
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,935
Number for hot off the press

1273
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,775
Absolutely and I've watched a bunch of his

1274
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
Is videos in

1275
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
He operates very similarly to Alex

1276
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,895
More boring

1277
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
And what he does is

1278
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,503
He just says a long series of like

1279
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
Buzzwords

1280
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,807
And then ask

1281
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
The rhetorical question

1282
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
Shannon that insinuates that you already know the answer

1283
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
And then just moves on really really quickly

1284
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
To the point where

1285
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,255
Whenever I was cutting clips from this

1286
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:58,399
If you look at the wave violin any player it's almost none

1287
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,215
There are barely any brake

1288
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,031
Where you can cut stuff out of there it's just almost like

1289
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,103
Good cardio

1290
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
F****** going

1291
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,919
And so you get stuff like this

1292
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,735
Actually there's a lot of good to consider

1293
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,759
You know right now it's

1294
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,807
Just seems so dark nobody wants tacos

1295
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
About it but

1296
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,391
You know over over the Long Haul to the Past

1297
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Couple years we've been

1298
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
Spending a lot of time

1299
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,999
Talking about this idea of

1300
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,023
Gettel Chrysler

1301
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,839
Society turns its back on Christ

1302
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
Well chaos is an adverb

1303
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
Understood thing my friend sent me right now we're seeing through Atwood living right through that

1304
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Is playing out in dramatic

1305
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,311
Fashion in fact

1306
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
With this election

1307
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
And I'm not going to tell you that

1308
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
Channel I can prove it

1309
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:48,319
The Democrats are absolutely cheating their way into the White House and on the ground I don't have any inside dope anymore than you do

1310
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,623
I can say this about the

1311
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,439
He looks that way and at the very very least

1312
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
You know we can say that we know

1313
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,791
They came up with a mail-in ballots

1314
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:03,935
Scheme that turn the election in Joe Biden's favorite right we can all agree on that has think about that for a minute

1315
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,495
Let's think about it let's think about that for a minute

1316
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Dan

1317
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,055
Haha all the things that he just

1318
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
Just posted that

1319
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
I think I got stuck on the chaos or Christ

1320
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Fairing

1321
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
I think that's where I kind of

1322
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Remember

1323
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,855
To remember every society and history

1324
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,695
Whenever we go back to history every single one that's turned away from

1325
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
Any society that sort of a different religion

1326
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
Just character than Christian

1327
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
Certainly

1328
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
Always chaos

1329
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,471
They were born turning away from Christ

1330
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
Find me that kind of

1331
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,031
That kind of

1332
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,823
Mentality is pretty

1333
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
Incompatible with

1334
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
Cooperation

1335
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,735
And it's definitely not something that you would

1336
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
Icy ground

1337
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
Alternative

1338
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,391
To your religious belief

1339
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,463
Being Universal is chaos absolutely

1340
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,767
And then remember that his religious beliefs

1341
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
Is

1342
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
Hating everyone in

1343
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
Including cat

1344
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
That's true

1345
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,167
It's going to be a problem

1346
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Then what's a mail-in ballot

1347
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
What's game other than

1348
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
People mailed in there

1349
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
Ballad sound like

1350
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,847
No it's just it's just

1351
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
You can mail them in or you can walk

1352
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,503
Yeah that's something that's always kind of like bum me out as I

1353
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:27,135
You know that Republicans can vote by mail today

1354
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,695
This isn't something that the left is doing

1355
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,023
But nefariously to only benefit themselves

1356
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:39,423
It's to help people vote in a difficult time you're the ones who made it a virtue signal to not vote

1357
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,983
Blaming others

1358
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,263
Foreboding

1359
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,871
That's a little bit silly guy's

1360
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
Absolutely not

1361
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,479
And well you know

1362
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,759
Making it more

1363
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551
Possible for people to vote

1364
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Is

1365
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,367
Okay

1366
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
All right of course

1367
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
You know that whole like

1368
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
It's obviously

1369
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
They stole

1370
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,583
I can't prove it I don't know

1371
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,887
Of course the only evidence

1372
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
But he provided was

1373
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
Democrats allowed people

1374
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
Do you watch them Infowars

1375
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,567
Exactly

1376
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,871
I halfway put this

1377
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Send here just

1378
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
Just for pasta

1379
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Okay

1380
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
How to things had to be done in other words in order for

1381
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
Old Uncle Joe to win

1382
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,623
And imagine if things were turned around and we were

1383
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,927
Imagine if Donald Trump had devised

1384
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
An eleventh-hour

1385
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,023
Ballot harvesting skiing at suddenly put him in the lead

1386
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,143
You think that maybe people deal with set about that in them in the media are they

1387
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
EXO

1388
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,959
It's fun to imagine

1389
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,775
How do you think he will react

1390
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
If that

1391
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
Well guess what I would think it's like if like

1392
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,527
But you know if everything has gone slightly differently

1393
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Trump

1394
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,879
Even as a president that I thoroughly don't like and don't trust

1395
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,975
We saying hey we got covid-19 going around this is really serious

1396
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Situation

1397
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,583
We need to find ways to make voting more accessible and safer for people

1398
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,399
To ensure that were able to carry out the election

1399
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
I wouldn't think

1400
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,751
He's trying to steal it by way of

1401
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,335
Expanding access to ballots. Like I don't

1402
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
I don't know Akiva I hate him

1403
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
And I would still

1404
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:31,807
Yes probably what you got to do you're just doing nothing that makes sense everything else you did was evil but

1405
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,087
This one makes sense

1406
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,927
People need to be protected as best as possible

1407
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Right hand

1408
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
People need to vote

1409
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,767
So if you're doing that

1410
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
I still hate you

1411
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,095
But that's cool keep doing that

1412
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,863
No

1413
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,679
Imagining that we are talking about Matt

1414
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
Scenario wherein

1415
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
He actually does

1416
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Find some

1417
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,103
Scheme to steal the election at the eleventh hour

1418
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,687
Do you think Michael mad is going to be like

1419
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Hey I don't like these schemes stealing votes and all that sex spec they won't be schemes at that point

1420
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,903
W honest-to-god ballots I'm sure I'm sure

1421
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
So

1422
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
Real real organic folks

1423
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,999
Coming out to

1424
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,791
Protest the Democrats appeal

1425
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
Mass last minute

1426
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
All of that stuff

1427
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,911
I just I just want that there just

1428
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,447
Just for when it does happen

1429
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
And I can just

1430
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Pull that up

1431
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
Alright

1432
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
And so he

1433
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,175
He does his similar rhetorical question that assumes the answer and Brooks

1434
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
All over it

1435
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
And the other thing is I mean does anyone

1436
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Question

1437
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Let this

1438
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
Party of death

1439
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,439
The party that campaigns on the right

1440
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
It's the fundamental right to

1441
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:48,863
Terminate the lives of unborn babies anybody question that such a party would indeed cheat their way into the White House

1442
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,167
If they thought they can get away with it

1443
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
That makes no sense

1444
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
Like

1445
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,055
Just promised structural standpoint of an argument that makes no sense

1446
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,895
I believe them to be evil because of Reproductive Rights

1447
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
Therefore

1448
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
They would steal in the like

1449
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
They would do anything

1450
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,551
His argument is

1451
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
If you're fine with abortion

1452
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,135
Then you are already

1453
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Free guilty

1454
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Of anything I suspect

1455
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,559
I willing to make that argument based on nothing that you could do it

1456
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,119
And then and now that's

1457
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:26,239
And this is another one of those situations where Larry Nichols

1458
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,055
I never said that Hillary killed anyone

1459
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
But

1460
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:36,735
Atlanta saying that she has the kind of personality where if someone did get killed should be upset of

1461
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
About it no

1462
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,063
Alright

1463
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:46,463
I've decided that they would steal it

1464
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,023
Okay cool

1465
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,071
What else what else do you got

1466
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,631
Hateful see what that would be more that's

1467
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
Way more fun than

1468
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,679
The way this dude is

1469
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:58,239
True true true

1470
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
That's it

1471
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,311
So this clip is

1472
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,591
A good example of like

1473
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,919
One of those situations where he just Rambles along

1474
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,711
Without stopping so there's no

1475
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,735
Real place to like

1476
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
Cut in cut out without

1477
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Losing a bunch

1478
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,367
So I'll just say that after he says all the things

1479
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
After he says that

1480
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Because Democrats are fine with abortion

1481
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
They

1482
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
They are

1483
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,279
Willing to steal anything

1484
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
And then he list

1485
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,351
Several examples of other things

1486
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:28,191
That they would be willing to do if you want including murder and yes Foster

1487
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
The whole thing and it's so long and I just don't want to

1488
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,567
Deal with it

1489
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,615
So then he

1490
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,663
Stop doing that and we get to his

1491
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,735
Essentially what they're preaching

1492
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,295
Is it doing whatever we want to do should be

1493
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
Come the whole of the law

1494
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Oh

1495
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,927
Which is the essence of satanism

1496
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
So when you think about it in that

1497
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Play the big news

1498
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,583
Today would be if the Democrats didn't cheat in these elect

1499
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,143
They are baby killers

1500
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,191
Of course they're cheap

1501
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,799
So we've gone from

1502
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,359
Of course they I believe they would

1503
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
2

1504
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,735
What would you say what would you assume I didn't do it

1505
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,599
Oh yeah yeah their sickness to do what thou wilt

1506
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,927
Some point there has to be a goddamn Crowley reference

1507
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Absolutely

1508
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
Play Fool boy and that's just

1509
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
It's just so like

1510
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
They are baby killers

1511
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
The end

1512
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,167
Like you have no room for any

1513
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
There's no like

1514
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,495
Hey what's your tax policy

1515
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,287
Nope you're a baby killer

1516
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,847
So graduated income tax

1517
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
Get the f*** out of here

1518
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
It's just that simple

1519
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,431
These people

1520
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
And that is

1521
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,479
Terrifying

1522
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,015
Yeah yeah

1523
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,647
I know it was

1524
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
And as far as other things that terrify me

1525
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
Try this

1526
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
Can I try it on

1527
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Please do

1528
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,631
But we still won

1529
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
In the long-term the long run

1530
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
Trump has remade that

1531
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,567
Pathetic Republican party for which I refuse to vote when they were running

1532
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Romney and McCain

1533
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
Tobacco back in the day

1534
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
He's turned that Republican party into a pro-life

1535
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
Proguides

1536
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:21,599
Pro-family Pro Blue Collar working American party

1537
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
They took the

1538
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,159
Best shot now

1539
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
From George Soros in his millions and his menu

1540
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
Set the best shot these guys had to offer

1541
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,303
Guess what

1542
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
We're still standing

1543
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
They're still debating this

1544
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
After all of that

1545
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,031
Evil laugh

1546
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
The Adria League

1547
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,103
Yeah it's upsetting

1548
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
And furthermore

1549
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
The things that he listed

1550
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:50,527
He's turned the Republican Party into a pro-life pro-family right

1551
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,415
Antivirus like that whole thing and I'm just go pro working class and I'm just sitting there going like

1552
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
The party that

1553
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,999
It sent in several hundred thousand people to death

1554
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Is pro-life

1555
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
The party that separates

1556
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
Children from their families

1557
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
Is pro-family

1558
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,703
And the party that is absolutely destroyed the working class

1559
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,031
Within no interest in any kind of stimulus package

1560
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:15,871
Anything along those lines no interest in doing anything good

1561
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
Is the party of the working

1562
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,967
In class pretty silly that's what these people think

1563
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
I think they're what they think

1564
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
Is that

1565
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
Well I think what they don't

1566
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,367
Nightcore they don't realize

1567
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,671
Is that Trump has become

1568
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,487
That to them because they did that

1569
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:38,143
They created this projection that they've applied to him you got it and I think that Trump is such a like

1570
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,191
A dick and a blank slate

1571
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,471
In terms of any real

1572
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:48,127
Seemingly any real care about anything able to do that whatever works the best

1573
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
St Liams into whatever seems

1574
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:56,319
Forget these damn dogs excited he's like make America great wasn't that fun

1575
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,439
He doesn't realize that

1576
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
Trump is his candidate because

1577
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:10,399
He's so vapid and he is even able to mold him into what you wanted

1578
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,959
It's one of the reasons why the last just disappointed with Viber

1579
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
Is because he's not

1580
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
Like an empty

1581
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:21,407
That's a really good point that he has things that disagree with some of the political beliefs

1582
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,199
Of people were more to the left

1583
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
And that that's

1584
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,783
That it if he was just an opportunist

1585
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Electron

1586
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
He might

1587
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,647
If one more handle it yeah that's probably true

1588
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
That's a really good point

1589
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Man he should have just lied

1590
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:42,655
Baby killer

1591
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,703
Was killing a baby at the

1592
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,751
That would be that would

1593
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
Probably been assigned but

1594
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
What are you

1595
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,359
Damn

1596
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
I think as we all know from listening to Alec

1597
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,199
What's that if Biden

1598
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Officially takes

1599
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Texas election

1600
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
God will have been

1601
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
Correct

1602
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,927
I mean I think it's gray but

1603
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,951
Yeah it sort of

1604
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Plan will be put

1605
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Backward

1606
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
Or something

1607
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,423
Atleast defeated God in this bad

1608
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
Be at the pole

1609
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
Now

1610
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
Do you think he's defeated God probably

1611
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,871
So maybe we're going to lose this election

1612
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:28,223
Chicks and cheating on the other side but that won't change the fact that we

1613
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,527
Put the world on notice friends don't forget this

1614
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
Just tell the spreader

1615
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,111
Spread this around we put the world on notice

1616
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
But God is not dead

1617
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:41,279
But he lives in Ox that he lives in our families that he lives in our unborn children

1618
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
That we will fight to the death

1619
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
For him and

1620
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
Brandy politician for anyone who's willing to

1621
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
To call out his name

1622
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
In the face of an eel

1623
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Pagan world

1624
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,895
God's Not Dead was that movie right over the Kevin Sorbo

1625
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
That sounds right

1626
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,943
Absolutely

1627
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,271
It's good to know that God is officially Not Dead

1628
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,599
Put on notice by people like

1629
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,903
Just got absolutely and I ate

1630
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
It's freaking me out that

1631
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,999
He's doing a little bit of what we

1632
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:16,607
I have conjectured that Alex was doing at the end it was trying to pull off at the end of

1633
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
16 election

1634
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
It was a moral victory

1635
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:27,103
Trump brought all of this to the Forefront and we got this moral Victory sure we didn't win this election but

1636
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,663
You have to redefine things

1637
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:34,271
Now I honestly don't think that is a uniquely like

1638
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
Like these guys kind of

1639
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
No no

1640
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
There are

1641
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Piano

1642
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,207
Electoral victories that don't go your way

1643
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
Or electoral contest

1644
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
Sometimes you do have to look down ballot

1645
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
And see you later

1646
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
Well yep

1647
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,679
That didn't go our way but some other stuff cuz it's pretty interesting got through and

1648
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,471
Some candidates to be excited about her there

1649
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:59,359
I think that's a normal human thing doesn't work that well when it's the battle between good and

1650
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,431
There is that kind of has a disconnect

1651
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
When it's just an election

1652
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
It's just like

1653
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,855
Hey you know I don't like this candidate I'm more comfortable with this one

1654
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,879
You can kind of

1655
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:16,255
Take solace in some victories and they will get some more work done next time

1656
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,815
Sure I don't think you should do that when it's

1657
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,119
The devil

1658
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
I mean when you say literally

1659
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,519
My opponents are baby killers who will do anything because

1660
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,799
If they're capable of that

1661
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,335
Then you can't trust them

1662
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
Ever

1663
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Anything

1664
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:37,759
And you're willing to die for any politician who says the word Christ

1665
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:42,367
Unless they're Democrat in which case they can't possibly believe how

1666
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,183
Then they're lying absolutely

1667
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,719
So it's difficult

1668
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
It's difficult to like a play the

1669
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
Do you like soda

1670
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Normal

1671
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,887
Rational games when you elevate things to an irrational left

1672
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
That's very strange to me

1673
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,471
And I think you could pull that off

1674
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,751
It is much better

1675
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
If Trump had never won

1676
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:04,383
Now that heat now that we are where we are

1677
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,687
About how Trump is and isn't going anywhere

1678
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,783
You know like this is a great example of that kind of

1679
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Thought process

1680
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
That's because it's literally

1681
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
It's not just

1682
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
We lost this election

1683
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
And we're going to

1684
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,463
It together and take care of

1685
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
It's

1686
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,791
We're ready to kill for him and we are ready to

1687
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
To die for him

1688
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
Yeah but we're not going to

1689
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,447
Probably going to

1690
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,079
Psychic control of the insanity

1691
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,663
We've completely lost it and it's time for a holy war

1692
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,711
It's that that isn't effective

1693
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,247
Tool that we can use

1694
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,295
To further our political goals

1695
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,903
And further whatever a business is at for like people like Alex totally

1696
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,743
You know that season is over or whatever if Trump loses

1697
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,583
Then you do have to go back to a more restrained like sure

1698
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,983
Victories we've got destroyed political correctness or whatever

1699
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,775
Do you have to do that and your total

1700
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:06,847
It wouldn't be so much better for everyone

1701
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,919
In that Griffey Community if trumpet never one

1702
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,199
Because then they could

1703
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Keep playing

1704
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,271
Like it made more sense

1705
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:17,087
2016 reloading Alex play the sort of

1706
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:22,975
You know hey you even if they steal it Trump's till 1 and you know it's great we can hang our head high

1707
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
That made sense

1708
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
Then it does not make sense

1709
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
Yep it's going to be

1710
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
Difficult move

1711
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
When you

1712
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
Basically said the West

1713
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,495
Western Civilization is over

1714
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
It's hard to go back

1715
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,871
Okay it's over but not if we win

1716
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
4 years

1717
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
That's how it works

1718
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
It's over by the midterms

1719
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,247
What

1720
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:51,391
Enter your boy let's start talking about moral victories Dan what do you

1721
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
Do you think is the most

1722
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Impressive thing Trump has

1723
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
That's interesting

1724
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
I don't know myself in that

1725
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Mindset

1726
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,447
I know for Alex but then he always goes to his he got out of the TPP

1727
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,519
So I guess maybe that or the Paris

1728
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,543
Record sure

1729
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:11,871
I don't know something about

1730
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,407
I think the answer will surprise you

1731
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
Paula white-cain Maybe

1732
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
Is he also showed

1733
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,527
Christ wins elections

1734
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
Music Christian

1735
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
Can win elections in America

1736
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,135
It's just amazing

1737
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Friends

1738
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:26,975
Amazing day

1739
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Christian

1740
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,047
In the United

1741
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
That's amazing

1742
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,143
Now admittedly

1743
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,935
Literally every president

1744
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Has been a Christian

1745
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Sure

1746
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,079
One of them was Catholic but he disagrees because he was fan of

1747
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:48,223
Vatican 2 aha election

1748
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
Recent

1749
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:54,367
I heard a big the Christian voters can win the

1750
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,159
Haha that's what I heard from

1751
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,695
OKC straight up

1752
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,231
Christians can win election

1753
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Okay did you talk about as a candidate

1754
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,327
Yep not voting blocks

1755
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Oh yeah

1756
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Weird

1757
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:11,519
Yeah that's even weirder than weird it was the way I heard it

1758
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,311
Estranged

1759
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Strange things

1760
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,871
Yeah I like literally

1761
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,919
Most people in the United States

1762
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,711
Have been Christian throughout our

1763
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,111
That's a sizable voting Bloc

1764
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,415
A very sizable

1765
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
So

1766
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,743
That's in

1767
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
Same

1768
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
That's insane

1769
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
But

1770
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
You know Dan

1771
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Because of trump

1772
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,751
That you know Christians weren't afraid but now that might be president

1773
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,567
Could be afraid then do you think

1774
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,103
New to big

1775
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:52,991
I don't know if you're doing this just to like intentionally asked me a bunch of rhetorical questions

1776
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
Thank you for catching up with me

1777
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
Stylistically

1778
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,415
But it was the whole idea as annoying coming from you

1779
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,767
That is if anybody can prove how annoying questions

1780
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,303
Who could it be better than

1781
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,375
I think you'll be scared

1782
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,239
And being afraid is nothing new for us heck I grew up as a child of the

1783
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
The Cold War

1784
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,567
Were the Communists were putting millions of

1785
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,847
People to death

1786
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,919
In gulags all over the world we always thought they were going to come

1787
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
You know

1788
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,015
We're hiding out in the woods at the time you should preparing

1789
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,807
You don't learn how to shoot

1790
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
In Huntington

1791
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,135
And defend ourselves worried about the communist

1792
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
We grew up that way

1793
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
You are still growing up that way I actually played this clip immediately

1794
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,399
We just because I feel like this confirms or at least adds to the evidence

1795
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,191
Inside of one of your main Theory

1796
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:49,567
About all these right-wing dogs like sort of emotional

1797
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
Scar ripples

1798
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,663
Of the Cold War

1799
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Traumatic 2

1800
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
These folks

1801
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,063
I don't actually have a full theory on why that is

1802
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,879
To what extent that explains a lot of this stuff

1803
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:09,279
You know it's the same way that like every single person that is an expert on Alex's show or on one of these other shows

1804
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,071
Will mixed up in a rom-com

1805
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,631
Every single person

1806
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,911
Is involved in Iran Contra

1807
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
And it's

1808
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,495
It's kind of the same you scratch any of these right-wing

1809
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
Hard right guys

1810
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
There is going to be Sonic

1811
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,871
Extreme feelings about the Cold War

1812
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,151
And

1813
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
Very strong

1814
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Assistance

1815
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,551
But it is still going on McCarthyism was cool it's great

1816
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,183
Why shouldn't people be blacklisted for being Jewish that makes perfect sense to him

1817
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,231
Yeah there is yeah it is

1818
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,327
In end in much the same way that

1819
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Slavery and the

1820
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:51,263
The aftermath is an untreated wound in the American psyche I think the cold war is another one

1821
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
I think it's another one where

1822
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,079
We lost our mind

1823
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,639
Not everyone distrusted each other

1824
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,991
Unsustainable

1825
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,551
Like we never really dealt with it

1826
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,135
I think that society would go a long way if week

1827
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
You could figure out ways

1828
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,463
To deal with these things as opposed

1829
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,767
Repressing them and getting angry

1830
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,047
And feeling guilty

1831
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,607
I or projected guilt

1832
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
Beginning of that stuff I think we'd be better off

1833
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,935
Amber

1834
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:24,031
Unfortunately I don't think we're going to do that I mean you see it you see exactly that

1835
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
Kind of idea is

1836
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
Because we haven't

1837
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
Because it saves

1838
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,455
Still open wound so many people are also susceptible

1839
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
To the same anti-communist prop

1840
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:37,599
Opaganda like what do you think this got do you think this guy is a Pez dispenser

1841
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Oh yeah

1842
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Of course he is

1843
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,183
Like all of these guys

1844
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:41,951
Just

1845
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,231
Have that same

1846
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
Propaganda

1847
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
In their back pocket

1848
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,375
Get it all time and it's always

1849
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,399
Effective

1850
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:56,287
So that's that's basically this is our last clip and I think I'll open it with

1851
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
One more rhetoric

1852
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Flash mobile app

1853
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,383
Should weirdo Chris

1854
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Jim's be discouraged

1855
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
Don't be discouraged

1856
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,343
Trump's not going away anyway

1857
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
And neither I

1858
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
The pickups

1859
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
Trucks in the flags

1860
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
And the boats

1861
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,023
And the millions of Americans who are

1862
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,559
Absolutely woke

1863
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
To the New World Order

1864
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
End of the Demons

1865
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
Set want to build it

1866
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,935
Thanks to what happened over the

1867
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Course of the past

1868
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
4 years in God

1869
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Providence

1870
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,799
Has a lot of words

1871
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
Yep Providence

1872
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
Beautiful boats

1873
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
You got it

1874
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:36,991
When when you said should weirdo Christians be discouraged I thought it was an interesting question

1875
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
Because you know

1876
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,575
The way I heard from you what should they be discouraged

1877
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
From being

1878
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,135
Weirdo Christian

1879
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,719
Should I be discouraged in terms of

1880
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,791
What's going on in the world

1881
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,863
Today feel like

1882
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
Yep I have completely

1883
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:59,007
That's why they're so question too dangerous

1884
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,311
Here's differ

1885
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
It was a rhetorical

1886
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,383
I think

1887
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,967
Yeah it's probably going away

1888
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:11,551
Everything's losses I don't think he has much relevance

1889
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
He's just a prop

1890
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
Do deer like

1891
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
The people who

1892
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,183
Support is movement anyway

1893
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,231
It's just up to some more competent

1894
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,279
Brightwing assholatu step-in

1895
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,839
And take that mantle that's why I am

1896
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
Because

1897
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
He's right

1898
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,959
Those trucks aren't going anywhere the

1899
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,543
The boats aren't going anywhere you might be right in that Trump is

1900
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,079
Trump personally is done

1901
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Because who gives a f***

1902
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
But the movie

1903
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,527
Those trucks are going away it's just going to be some other f****** s*** caught late

1904
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,599
Temple are just now sitting ducks

1905
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,671
For indoctrination to whatever the next

1906
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
Person who

1907
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
Scratches that itch yepiz

1908
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
That'll probably be

1909
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,631
Probably be a fairly familiar name

1910
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
I don't know

1911
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:05,055
Will safe Dinesh D'Souza will be the next right-wing cult leader I mean it should

1912
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
It should have been

1913
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
Should have gone better

1914
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Because

1915
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
I don't know but

1916
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,991
They're they're definitely not going anywhere

1917
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
End it

1918
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Italy

1919
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,831
Testament to this b******* that

1920
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
My uncle

1921
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,135
But so far as I know

1922
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,415
Is absolutely

1923
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:24,255
I don't remember him hurting recently

1924
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,583
An interesting Lee enough

1925
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,863
Because it's only be

1926
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,399
Cousin Vatican 2

1927
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,703
That he would even talk to my uncle

1928
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,751
Because my uncle's a non-catholic

1929
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:39,359
Do you know what I'm saying like what type of s*** we're somehow they create this

1930
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
Nonsense Coalition of

1931
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,943
Stupid beliefs

1932
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
And they hate each other

1933
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:47,295
Yeah yeah it's it's amazing to me

1934
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,575
That is that is

1935
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,111
Funny that I never even

1936
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:55,231
Thought for a second that your uncle wasn't Catholic

1937
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
But I think this happens

1938
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
All the

1939
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
I would guarantee this happens

1940
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,911
All the time people are sending these things that

1941
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,679
Agree with

1942
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
Write short clips

1943
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,239
And if you

1944
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
Backup all the sudden you like

1945
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:14,687
Oh s*** I didn't know I was being yours are some rumors were sending you this s*** I don't know the

1946
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,503
Text of any of this stuff that I am passing along

1947
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:23,135
I think that's one of the dangers of the social media age to like I think a lot of people are guilty of that

1948
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,207
I think everybody can do a little bit of a better job booth

1949
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,255
I hate to say this because

1950
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:34,655
Become the thing where it's like well think before you retweet

1951
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,471
Be better for everyone if people that that just retweet

1952
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,751
I didn't make sense

1953
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,847
Yeah about whether or not the teacher

1954
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,663
Damn that is a do you have any closing

1955
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
Thoughts on that

1956
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:52,063
No other

1957
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,415
I think that it's interesting whenever we go down one of these episodes that you take over

1958
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,767
Today we get a glimpse of somebody that we've never heard before but is

1959
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
Weirdly very familiar

1960
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,655
And it also is like you know a we need more people

1961
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,215
To talk about you know like we need more

1962
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,055
I think they're all wisps

1963
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:18,944
Yeah it's not your fault I don't want to go to no Charisma, disconnect Charisma vacuum

1964
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
He's making weird mouth noises

1965
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:24,832
Realgar

1966
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:31,232
Is bad just not somebody that I could ever be interested in

1967
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,280
More for not going to sustain this

1968
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
Yeah but it does it does sort of depict

1969
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
The sort of

1970
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:42,240
The intended messages this video that got sets

1971
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
To you and then what

1972
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,544
Behind it is something

1973
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,568
I bet

1974
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,920
Is good to point out to be aware of

1975
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,992
So thank you Jordan that you are very welcome

1976
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528

Until I believe we're going to have an epic

1980
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:11,168
Episode on Monday

1981
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,752
Unimportant number I mean not really but pretend a little.

1982
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,640
We do have a website it's not right. Calm we're also on

1983
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:27,040
We aren't going to bed Jordan

1984
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:30,112
Find a local charity or Bellefonte in your area to help out people doing

1985
