Little bit about Alex G

8
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordans

9
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888

00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
You show

14
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,480
And a little bit as I was getting

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
Today's episode ready

16
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
And

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
It's so cool to be able to go back

18
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
The Lincoln Lodge where we're doing

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
And I was thinking back to my Early Times doing stand-up and what are the things that I feel really grateful for

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
Is that I was able to perform at the Lincoln restaurant

21
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Were they moved

22
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
And

23
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
I just wanted the greatest

24
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
What a great like

25
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,336
Vibe an experience that was that room

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
And The Ivy

27
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
The chaos of

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736
Going to Reggie's afterwards for a mystery beard

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,856
That was just a great great I feel very lucky to have been

30
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
You're just timing base

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
And I never did the Lincoln restaurant to be fair was a little early for me to have done

32
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,912
I might not have been fully

33
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Might not have had a tight end there is loose

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
All the people at the lodge had more than a Titan

35
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Tuesday value

36
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
In my memory

37
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Anxiety nice to

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,416
To be able to get back on a stage for the first time in a very long time and it be

39
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Heather new venue

40

41
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Yeah I'm in my bright spot is the same little bit of a different

42
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,752
Performed at the Lakewood Lodge before it's kind of funny that I I did stand up

43
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Chicago for 10 years in the only time I'm going to perform at the lodge

44
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
Just because of my

45
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,920
F****** D&D ship

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
I'm excited just because it's my first time back

47
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Chuck because you started a trivia night

48
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
But basically

49
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Your Escape calling bingo

50
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632

00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
I'm nervous

56
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
You know I'm one of the things that make me kind of

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Just stop doing it

58
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
You know slowly over time just

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,936
Stop going it's cuz everytime I would have a show I wouldn't be nervous or excited I be like

60
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
It was like I became one of those old Roadhouse

61
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Just like I'm just

00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616

00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
No I mean like I just barely have a pulse

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928

Alex is at given life is giving dad

112
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
Giving love is taking it away right

113
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391
Literally all marriages end either in divorce or death

114
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487

115
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631

00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Longboard

Let's get down to business

142
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:13,055
Perfectly honest I listen to b of the show that

143
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
I just lost my patience for it

144
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Entirely

145
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
Do Wednesday the talk about that because there was a big nose he had

146
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Spell dying

147
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Gabe Cosby

148
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
Just getting out

149
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
It was like this is going to be in Alex's wheelhouse

150
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Because these things are

151
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Are kind of difficult for Alex to work

152
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Prevailing narrative

153
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
John Mackey

154
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,311
Kathy was killed by Hillary rights and Hillary also kill Donald Rumsfeld I hope so

155
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
Well but I mean like how is this going to work the gas is going to play

156
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,503
Yeah I don't know if it's going to be tough to fit into the

157
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
The matching game that he's

158
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
I've been playing up to this point

159
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
Yeah it's like I'm one of those XY axis you have that data point that's just so far away from the curb that you're like

160
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
There's just nothing we can do about that one

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
It's so important

162
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Elsa as a person

163
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
Who is dying

164
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Until I was

165
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
I was interested in

166
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
He seen that so I just jumped ahead to the 30th

167
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Our hub

168
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,919
Play restart on the 28 years where Alex is at

169
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,295
Joe Biden is globalist Joe Biden wants to sell the country out

170
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
The Pentagon is

171
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,863
Major pressure

172
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
State to get

173
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
Is Allah doesn't kill you ice cream sandwiches

174
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,871
By the shutdown a bunch of our pipelines Biden's open the borders up

175
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,199
He told the illegal aliens as soon as he got in

176
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
He's working destroy the country

177
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
At least for now when it comes to stand

178
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Administration came out

179
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
There's no reason to be there we are pulling out

180
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
That is good

181
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Report

182
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
Good news

183
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
About Dubai

184
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,007
Yeah that's to be couched in he's also destroying the country.

185
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,823
There's so many people at the Pentagon who are tired of this

186
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,407
The American people that's a different kind of

187
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
That's the Deep

188
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Satanic cult

189
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Is the Patriot pentagon

190
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
This is a good guys

191
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Compressor on bike

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Right

193
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,439
Alex can't even enjoy like a good this is positive

194
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
Nono whenever

195
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
Are you have cast your enemy is the

196
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,887
Servants of literal Satan they can't be like well that one's a win-now what is the devil doing

197
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,031
Exactly what I have encouraged people to do

198
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
General

199
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Yeah

200
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
So

201
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Alex also gets into a trip

202
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
He's going to be taking this guy is going

203
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
All over the

204
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
It went to New York

205
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Sure you'll be on a podcast

206
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Or maybe talk

207
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Talk to the attorney general he's gone from sea to shining sea

208
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,767
To be on podcast

209
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Another trip

210
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
It's coming up just a next day on Tuesday

211
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Critical

212
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,567
Information so we're going to be going to the Border but I got a call from my accountant this morning I went live

213
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
He said will you please

214
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
I know you got a Dory cost lot of money

215
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
Because you are going to the red

216
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
You need to really explain to listeners that

217
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,207
Hibachi shirts anandibai books films water filtration

218
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Ocean

219
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Or you're going to have to

220
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Stop doing this

221
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
Not your fault let me have the products and the supplements you buy them

222
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Herself

223
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
But we're not able to

224
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,335
Most the time

225
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
On the covid lockdown still the supply chain

226
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Because we give you high quality vitamins and minerals in

227
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
We could get crap from China

228
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
But we're not doing that so somebody products we normally have a stock or sold out for

229
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
678 months

230
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Supply

231
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
We're running the July 4th super sale right now double Patriot Point

232
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Listeners fault

233
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
How are they not doing

234
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Exactly what you want them to do

235
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
100% real conversation that happen

236
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Alex

237
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Tell your listeners

238
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Money for you to go to New York need to buy T-shirts I need to buy products

239
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:48,767
Flagrant 2 did not translate to enough Salesforce to justify that to

240
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,607
So Trump is coming to the Border Trump is going to get

241
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
I do his Riley down there

242
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
I've got to go and try to get some attention

243
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
Everything will be fine if we knew how to operate our

244
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Supply chain

245
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
The problem listeners is that

246
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
You won't allow us

247
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
To get through these covid embargoes that keep us from getting the products that you guys have already bought for us

248
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
This is all your fault

249
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
It seems like Alex

250
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Is is

251
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Trying to

252
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Looks like

253
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Solicit sales

254
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
By way of saying

255
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,287
You guys always buy everything

256
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Except we're always out of stock

257
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
To the change should be the stocking

258
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Aspect of it as opposed to

259
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Trying to push sales

260
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,063
Well if you need to do have stuff in

261
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Excel might be a bit of a

262
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Might be what I believe

263
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
Bulshit

264
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
So

265
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
Little bit into the show something happened that really threw me for a loop

266
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
This was

267
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Weird

268
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
This is something I don't think I

269
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
I've heard

270
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Very often

271
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
At all Beyond

272
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
Does one take me to Driftwood instrumental introduction

273
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
What

274
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Let me just get this out of the way

275
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,487
Because I'm 47 my mind still pretty Sharp

276
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
10 years ago my brain wouldn't have done this

277
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
A lot of things on my mind I was thinking about other stories

278
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
I'm just not really

279
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Fixating on

280
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Joe Biden

281
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Mostly what I said

282
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
About

283
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,111
Pulling out of that was true

284
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
Trump policies

285
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
Trying to get the different warring factions to stop

286
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
Killing each other in Syria at least on paper

287
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
That's all tomato

288
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
But when I said that he was saying

289
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,031
Normalize relations with a side of lb station that was completely wrong

290
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Pull that up and I was real

291
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,967
I was incorrect and I don't know why I said that

292
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
Sanction he was cautious Arab States and its normalising ties

293
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
With Syria's Assad

294
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
I don't want to water War least on the surface

295
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Hoping for peace

296
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Thank you optimistic

297
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
U.s. 12 allies of sanctions for those

298
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
Other always there so that

299
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Is corrected

300
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Real-time we are not like Brian stelter

301
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Weird

302
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,183
That weirdo weirdo than the Undertaker coming out on its Wicked

303
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Beats Pill

304
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
A lot of product to serial we see a lot of very

305
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
Pro-assad things from him in the past and this one seems really weird it's it's strange

306
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,847
I don't think that is all that weird that he has a pro-assad kind of mentality and editorial

307
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
Given a lot of his other beliefs

308
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
It makes sense

309
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
Like where he's at Evel dick

310
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
This is weird

311
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
This makes

312
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Very little sense

313
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Need to correct

314
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Icanvas

315
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Almost the immediate

316
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Totally

317
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
I think it's probably just cuz

318
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
The glaring and ridiculous

319
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Wow

320
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,631
Here is actually from earlier in the show him making this

321
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
Mistake and you can see if you listen to this

322
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
He even gave himself an out

323
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
He didn't leave the correct

324
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Just last week

325
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Biden told Saudi Arabia

326
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
Call Steph

327
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,247
We're going to put sanctions on you

328
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,367
Flip-flop next week

329
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
Like what is happening

330
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Even says like you are going to flip flop back next week or they could be could just use that as like a way to ignore the

331
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Never said that

332
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Yeah

333
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,519
This is weird it's very strange

334
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,335
So one of the things I think is important to

335
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
Big noise about this is how this mistake

336
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
His maid

337
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
There are plenty of things that you can get wrong

338
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
In different ways

339
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Princeton

340
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Could misspeak

341
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
And this is your brain totally Kyle whatever

342
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
It happens

343
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
Another way you can make a mistake cuz if you get a fact wrong

344
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Like you can save it

345
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
Played for five different NBA teams when in fact he played for 6

346
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,911
You could forget one of those teams or have got the wrong Statin your head and just never corrected

347
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
We all have tons of inaccuracies floating around in our head

348
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
Times we don't realize them

349
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
Until we speak them out loud and then we get

350
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
There's no real shame and make

351
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
A mistake like that so long as you're able to integrate the correct information when it

352
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
It's presented to you

353
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
I don't get defensive about like now

354
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
5 memes

355
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,207
No I understand I forgot that he was on the sons too that have

356
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
This is not the sort of error that Alex's make

357
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
You're nor did he miss speak

358
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
He read a headline

359
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,191
The story and then he went to commercial one of his employees

360
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
But he made up of

361
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Complete

362
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Eddie realized I better

363
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
GardenWalk that back

364
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
You can tell from the headline Metallica's working off of

365
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
Quota sighting sanctions us cautions Arab states

366
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Against normalizing ties with Syria's Assad

367
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,879
Beer that Alex is making here isn't a matter of a fact being wrong he's got an entire concept wrong

368
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
The framework of the story is completely false

369
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
He read this headline wrong

370
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Anywhere

371
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
From there

372
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,399
Talked a lot in the past about how is real gift is when it comes to analysis is being able to

373
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Connect to the.

374
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
So I would guess what happened with the follow

375
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
I like to read the bible plan to withdrawal

376
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Troops from Afghanistan

377
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,663
I have these Kim's other headlines Alex is trying to make connections to this story that could work for him

378
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Pulling out of Afghanistan

379
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
Supporting Assad or two things that Alex

380
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,063
Can say Trump would do so he can praise Biden for doing them

381
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
And presented his Biden ripping off Trump in that angle can

382
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Play on info

383
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,559
This headline announces reading is from an article out of al-arabia and there's no conceivable way that Alex

384
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Could have read the article

385
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,935
And Come Away with the impression that was about Biden demanding countries normalize relations

386
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Facade

387
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Al-rabiah is a media Network that's run out of the egg UAE by a Saudi own company called the MBC group

388
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,735
Saudi Arabia and Asad are not on great terms and the paper is an editorial position that easy

389
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Not favorable

390
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Suicide

391
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,855
The only explanation for Alex you know haven't

392
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
To come out

393
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
I'll do this correction for this headline.

394
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
It is that he

395
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Skims

396
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
I skimmed this headline in the news made up a story about the this mist

397
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
That would fit with the other stories that he's covering that.

398
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
And this may seem like a trivial point that I'm making but

399
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
It's not

400
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
When you're dealing with someone like Alex

401
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Exude disseminate

402
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,847
Consistently shity information

403
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
What are the critical things to pay attention

404
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,199
Shinto is how the information makes it from the start

405
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Pinpoint in a primary source

406
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,063
To destination is a thing that Alex is reporting on his show

407
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,391
If you do pay attention and read the primary sources that he's using

408
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
You'll almost always find it underneath his outrage

409
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,535
There's nothing more than him not understanding the subject he's covering

410
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
Often due to his unwillingness to put in the app

411
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
The epistemological process that Alex uses to create his content

412
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
He's completely unreliable

413
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
It is correction really well illustrates how this

414
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Exact same everybody made here

415
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
It's whether you make stops

416
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
This one had to do with the idea that the globalist

417
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Play nice with Assad though

418
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,783
We need to make a correction about it which is the weirdest

419
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Yeah

420
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
The mistake

421
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Isn't weird

422
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
The mistake

423
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,303
Read a headline didn't understand it and decided to write a story that he tells his audience

424
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
This

425
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,423
Direction is f***** up did he feel the need to correct

426
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
So quickly and so immediately

427
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,287
Cuz it was

428
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Technically

429
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
In some way complimenting Biden

430
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,455
No because I think that use is

431
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Qualify

432
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
Your complement of pulling out of Afghanistan A reduced pension Afghanistan is there too

433
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
What is this white

434
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
Regular situation

435
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
If I had to

436
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
Put forth a guess I would say

437
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,608
That's not it

438
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,216
I think that Alex might be keenly aware that his audience is full of a sod

439
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
He knew that he would get corrected on that by people who were listening like

440
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
What are you talkin about

441
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
It does seem like this is something that he thinks

442
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
People will

443
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Catch

444
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
It is audience and he's aware of that

445
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
And as such

446
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Eunos

447
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,232
Bad like I bungled that one

448
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
Corey I bet he didn't even know I bet one of his employees

449
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:59,424
Correct

450
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:04,800
Wow I mean I'm just saying damn if we start

451
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:09,408
Kowtowing to Assad fans as part of our editorial position

452
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
I think we're going to make it

453
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,552
I think we're really going to turn into a big show

454
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,648
I guess this is what it takes to get hours to collect something

455
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Yep that's

456
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:27,072
But halfway it'll first hour here he is

457
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
China build

458
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Suspense by

459
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
Talk about how he's not building

460
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Suspension

461
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
A story that he hasn't explained yet

462
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
In-store sure promise

463
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Netherlands

464
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
Do you know I'm not trying to build up

465
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
It's on this but if I just cover this

466
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
Special Report on this after show today

467
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,328
And then

468
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Nearby battalion

469
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,520
But I'm not going to release this information now

470
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
No big deal

471
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Bad news

472
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
This is going to go nowhere no matter what

473
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Cuz it's not

474
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Wow

475
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,576
I was like okay I'm ready I'm ready for another dud

476
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
Sometimes it sometimes when you say he's

477
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Building suspense

478
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,512
That's without actually do I feel like I should just be given an opportunity to like see if I can

479
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,560
Pull exactly what

480
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
He's going to say we've always

481
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
We've always heard this exact

482
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
They've like

483
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
I'm not going to build suspense here

484
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
I'm just saying that this is a big

485
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
Story if you guys want this big story to have an impact

486
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
And that's what we need to do this big story has to have a big impact yet otherwise

487
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,112
Bible need to let everybody know how big this is going to be

488
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Yeah you could do that speech

489
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,560
Probably in your sleep you could predict what

490
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,144
The story itself

491
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
It could be any

492
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Yap's

493
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
I'm not going to build

494
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,056
That's actually I'm just going to get into it now

495
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Alright

496
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,360
Checkpoint at the

497
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,688
Car park before I get to work everyday and that's

498
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
I wish that was what it well

499
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
This report is just really really really big with a Time

500
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
I just hope this goes viral because it needs to this is such a big deal

501
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,120
If you read Klaus Schwab

502
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
5 books

503
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
And yes I've read all five of them

504
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Bulshit

505
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
And the reason

506
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Get so angry

507
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
I think you just don't like reading

508
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
Les Schwab is written more than

509
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
In five bucks

510
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
The most recent one is covid-19 the great reset which of course is the book that Alex has not read but is Bill plenty of conspiracy

511
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Theories around

512
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,952
But he also wrote stakeholder capitalism

513
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
The fourth Industrial Revolution shaping the fourth Industrial Revolution

514
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,096

2021 Global 19 covid-19 predictions

521
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Alex

522
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
Now he would do better with Harry Potter in

523
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600

No you

529
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
This report

530
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,192
Whatever Alex is going to get into it something to do with Klaus Schwab

531
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
I guess

532
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm not sure that it is

533
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
This morning's Dallin Barnes is almost as well

534
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,896
Stop it

535
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176

Breeders one dress

544
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Information they were putting out is because they refuse to

545
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Comply with public health guidelines during a pandemic

546
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Killed million

547
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Some people that'll do it

548
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,744
Also whatever is going on I have no idea how Barnes is going to be involved in lawsuits

549
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Stop it like I don't think

Now he's he's a director of legal strategy

A bunch of Canadian lawyer

554
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,104
I bet he is underlying story there was a video that was going around from Nova Scotia

555
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,968
Dr. Robert strank the chief medical officer for the province was taking questions about the pandemic

556
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
A reporter asked

557
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
If there was still need to have an injunction

558
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Cancel large Gatherings given the trajectory the cases were on

559
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,488
Bringing together

560
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Continuing to keep an eye on it and

561
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Situation

562
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,728
He also did say that the injunction is useful for public health because it was preventing the Gathering of quote

563
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,056
Groups that are deliberately spreading false information that creates

564
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Risk

565
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,968
This probably was a bad way to express his point so I'm going to call this one and unforced error

566
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:36,576
Here and the surface appearance of what

567
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Sakrete suspicions but

568
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
Anyone looking at

569
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,184
Contacts to your appropriately would understand what doctor

570
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Whispering was saying

571
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
Yeah I mean the ultimately it's

572
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
So hard not to think that

573
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
There is a

574
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Quite a bit that

575
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Gatherings

576
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
Designed to spread both

577
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Bulshit and covid

578
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
Of which there were some

579
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:57,568
Have a lot in common with our cells

580
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,408
Also this clip is from May 31st

581
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
DeSoto about a month old

582
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
This point

583
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,320
It was posted on a trump meme Twitter account called new Granada on the 27th

584
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,136
I got picked up by qanon blogs

585
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
Banda media Outlets like Alex and Steven Crowder

586
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
In the recent days this Twitter account is promoting the idea that the Q posted to John McAfee Twitter account was a crypto encryption key

587
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,472
They're also blowing Minds by talking about the Georgia Guidestones

588
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Plugging Auntie mask

589
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
Shirts that they were selling

590
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,104
Sure basically this is kind of just a meme

591
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Attention-grabbing account

592
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
That's a bit light on

593
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,432
Editorial rigor

594
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,784
Play some Alex sees fit to basis big Bombshells on their tweets

595
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
Yeah that's not good

596
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Yeah you get one sweet you got a story that's all you need

597
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:47,232
I actually went and I found the full Daily Briefing on YouTube from Nova Scotia and it's

598
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Pretty easily access

599
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Very easily

600
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
All of them

601
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,936
From this the government of Nova Scotia are available

602
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:01,824
You can find them regularly

603
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:07,712
What are the things that's really funny about taking this clip and insisting that it shows some kind of evil government desire to

604
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
To control the public

605
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Is that if you watched

606
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
The full briefing

607
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,112
The number one question is about their recent decision to reopen

608
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
School

609
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,232
Most of the conversation that's happening is Doctor Strang and Premier ranking

610
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Defending the decision to reopen

611
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:26,144
Where is the feedback of the receiving is mostly about concerns that it might be too soon to write

612
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,728
Nova scotian officials words

613
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
The progress that

614
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
I've been made and how to keep that progress going

615
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,920
All the contacts that bigger picture is ignored because of that short clip that Alex can play

616
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
Includes one of the official saying something that's useful

617
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,016
The s*** head to want to derail all the work that's

618
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
Identify pan.

619
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
And

620
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
B b

621
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Snooze

622
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
I mean

623
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,720
You almost want

624
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
That clip to also it like

625
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,072
If you want to say something like that

626
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
In a daily briefing you also have to

627
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Did you start with

628
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,728
Goodness we're ending our tyrannical and Draconian measures

629
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,592
We are ending them there no more tyrannical or Draconian measures

630
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,920
0 tyrannical or draconian

631
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
Reminding everybody

632
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
No more

633
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Alex

634
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
He will also want to talk about vaccines

635
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Viet evil

636
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
And bad

637
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
And

638
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,584
The clip from official at the World Health

639
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
Innovation

640
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
And then

641
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
Clip of his own

642
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,568
Here's the UN director of The Who admitting their plan for more face masks that actually don't work

643
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,360
And then from 11 years ago

644
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
My analysis and others don't we're really facing

645
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320
So the Clippers Alex plays of the World Health Organization spokesperson is just them saying that a vaccine alone isn't going to magically solve everything

646
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,648
Actual piece of the strategy but not the entire pandemic

647
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Strategy on its own

648
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
This isn't evidence that lockdown to last forever or whatever

649
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
The f*** Alex is trying to say

650
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Now ask for his own

651
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,376
Clip from 11 years ago

652
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
This is exciting

653
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
You sounded heard there's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo

654
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,712
Different type of Medical Treatments vaccine we're seeing a medical parenting thing setup

655
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,808
Worldwide under the UN and the world

656
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
Organizations behind the Bilderberg Group

657
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:32,608
Carry out their population agenda and they want to do it through the medical system and that's why vaccines are so important

658
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:39,008
We know that many of these vaccines turn out that serious adverse reactions and this is being done by Design

659
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:43,104
They kill you slowly over time

660
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,504
I think you should really talk to doctor Reema Lebo she doesn't live inside the United States

661
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:01,280
Come up here and talk to you some medical doctor and she really understands what's happening on

662
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
Where's the doctor now

663
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:18,432
So Alex is evident to the stage conversation that he had

664
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
From Jesse Ventura conspiracy theory

665
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
It is a little bit like

666
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,184
The Undertaker showing up I will say that there's another Super Body

667
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,048
The funniest thing though is that Alex is telling Jesse Ventura to go find arima labo

668
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,680
If you don't recall Rhema labo is the anti-vax advocate who is married to General stubblebine

669
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,032
And the two came onto Alex's show to sell their laminated don't vaccinate me cards

670
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Switch work grossly overpriced

671
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
Real good they were like 50

672
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,992
18 bucks or were they supposed to be about the evil the vaccination but couldn't

673
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Stay on track

674
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,832
Can started ranting what other was a genocide against the white man going on

675
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,744
That was pretty early too in terms of like the right-wing adopting that as a talking point yeah

676
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
Trailing far behind

677
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
Supremacist to been on that tip for a long time

678
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
Rema labor recently gotten

679
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:15,520
In some hot water with the FDA and the Department of Justice issued a permanent injunction against

680
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
Enter to stop her from selling her nanosilver

681
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
Is a covid-19 cure

682
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:22,176
Associate outside similar tracks

683
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,992
Permanent injunction it takes it takes quite a bit

684
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
For those dudes

685
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
Get to work like that Alex's big

686
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,880
Bombshell was this nonsense

687
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Small clip of a Canadian

688
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Briefing

689
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,792
And then is evidence covid-19

690
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,632
Becoming Sewell I knew that Barnes was coming up and I don't want to listen to

691
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
The barns in Lake

692
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,192
Alex

693
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,752
Evidence of his Bona fides is

694
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,056
Jesse Ventura TV show clip

695
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
He said it was like I hate this

696
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Can't take it away from him what about Rumsfeld

697
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
Is because the 29th

698
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,904
I was Alex

00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
When's check in on the 30th

This is going on

710
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
2 miles from me

711
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
42 minutes

712
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
3 boxes delivered

713
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
At least 7

714
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
Building one of them is 80 yards long Warehouse when

715
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
Tore something you just see hundreds of women and children inside

716
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
I'm standing there as a bus pulls up

717
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
Another bus around the corner.

718
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
People in cages

719
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880

720
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
People in cages with

Private Mercenaries

722
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,352
Catholic charity outfits driving border patrol buses with guns on their side

723
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Really

724
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
3 minutes

725
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Walking around here

726
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Looking around little where they are

727
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680

Blue-eyed children

731

Without them

732
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,896
Without their father's coming up to the security guard

733
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
English

734
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760

Wow that sounds like

738
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Some pretty shocking video that Alex

739
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Scott

740
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,472
So I immediately I was like all right Alex isn't in studio

741
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:30,336
Maybe he'll call in at some point and do a little dance but Rumsfeld or something

742
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
Sure

743
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,760
For his response to Rumsfeld

744
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
Recording right now we we do

745
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
Know if it has come to

746
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
There's talk of charges against the Trump organization

747
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Supposed to leave imminent or somebody

748
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
The cfo's turned himself in today

749
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
Did you know I know that I look so probably haven't

750
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
You know how we're able to process stuff

751
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,016
But I heard this as like I'm not going to wait around for Alex

752
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,296
To call back in

753
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
Say something

754
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Watch this video

755
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,696
Check out this video is Alex as evidence

756
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
Kids screaming for their mom

757
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,560
I mean I'm not going to not

758
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,400
Say that the idea that he would

759
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,496
Only say that there were children in cages at the border

760
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
Children

761
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Steve

762
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
I'll just I'll just

763
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,616
Spell this out for you

764
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
The cages

765
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm not actually

766
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Mackage

767
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Yeah a boss

768
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
There's a

769
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,320
Big boss that people

770
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,392
We're being transported as a door

771
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Between

772
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
Where the passengers were

773
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,768
Yeah the the

774
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:58,144
Okay okay

775
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
And the driver section

776
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Open up to disembark people for

777
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
From The Bodyguard

778
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
And that's what I was referring to

779
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
The cages there's no cages that he actually has

780
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
Any evidence I was in this

781
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,712
In this video

782
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Him saying

783
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Can you believe this

784
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
You will not be

785
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Leave this right

786
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Would like blood

787
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,368
Yeah

788
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,184
It's infuriating and honestly I think

789
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
This

790
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Turned my stomach a bit

791
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
It made me very sad and fairly angry

792
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
At the same time

793
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
It's my job

794
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
2

795
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,776
And I'm not not disassociate from that sure

796
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Get past it a little bit in order to provide

797
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
What I think is a really important

798
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Teachable moment about this video

799
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,528
And I think that there's something that you can see if you pay attention

800
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
That is super in Port

801
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
So this is the way that Alex's setup

802
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
The clip

803
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,464
To our right this is 42 minute video this is what they

804
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,768
A lot of is exaggeration and embellish

805
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
But the selling point of it

806
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Is he saw

807
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,888
Blue-eyed blonde hair children

808
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Who are crying for their mom

809
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,704
Anime get with

810
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Into the spider hole that is this charity

811
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
Does he not realize that he is

812
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:16,480
Is prioritizing literally the Aryan Master race in his mind as a

813
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
He has to know that

814
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,624
At least he knows that this is what he's trying to use as a trigger for his audience

815
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Play there's no way that you do

816
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,720
So Alex is down there in

817
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
McAllen Texas along with his buddy Tim

818
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
I believe the guy want the gun store

819
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:38,240
I'm not sure is it one of Alex's weirdo Buddies

820
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,896
What may get there there is or what the video start

821
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,968
There's a family that is being taken to a vet

822
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Out of this Castle

823
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
For charity

824
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
And

825
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
There's a bunch of people around

826
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,392
Short and Tim

827
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,672
Is

828
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Complaining about how many how much is a

829
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Security they have

830
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
You folks are going to be Tran

831
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Transported

832
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
McAllen international airport

833
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
City of their choice

834
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
This is the third load being loaded up

835
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,176
That interesting thing is this is supposedly a Catholic

836
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Security personnel

837
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
The dirt bringing out

838
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
To put this family into the van

839
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
You got one two three four five

840
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,184
Seven security personnel

841
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,976
Horton cargo for Democrat

842
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
Farm and milk the welfare

843
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
They're going to sign this human cattle up for this

844
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
Imagine 7 security

845
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Okay on an hourly basis

846
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
To sit there

847
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
And transport these people make sure they're protect

848
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
They have all that security because Alex Jones and his goons are there

849
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
Is there to keep you guys from being like

850
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
Villager song

851
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:03,232
It's absolutely disgusting for people like Alex to antagonize people and create super tense unsafe situation

852
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
And that when people calmly responded provides

853
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,096
Security to make sure that he can't escalate situations

854
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
Do that security is now evidence

855
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
The people were being a mega Niger up to no good

856
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
The security is there

857
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
Because of you Alex

858
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
They're there because you showed up in

859
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
Bangun someone's car for attention months

860
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,432
This is the same place where he went out

861
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,320
The Catholic charity of Rio Grande Valley security is there because

862
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,160
Alex encouraged his listeners to show up to the charity and harass them

863
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
Who knows what they've been dealing with since then

864
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,280
Alex is the reason that these people are there because

865
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
He's a danger

866
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,912
Also I hate to be petted but if you watch the video you'll see that at least

867
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
Who are the people in the video who Alex

868
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,472
His friend Tim

869
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,520
He's calling security are wearing shirts

870
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
What's a Heartland Disaster Response

871
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
These people are volunteers who work with a group called Heartland response

872
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
The texas-based quotes

873
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
Compassion coordination

874
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Center

875
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,319
You consult their website you'll find their mission is described as this

876
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,671
Heartland responses in emergency and Disaster Response organization focused on

877
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,207
Parent training and educating

878
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,279
In the disciplines of Emergency Management Disaster Response

879
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,095
And Recovery as well as other forms of Compassionate Care

880
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Further the mission is

881
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,959
Facilitate Unity among disaster in crisis response Anthony's church

882
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Synagogues

883
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
Businesses and individuals throughout

884
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
The faith community

885
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,871
People people putting their faith into action and helping people in a desperate

886
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
Situation so

887
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
It's not too surprised

888
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
Embassy people like Alex make them out to be filling

889
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,879
Yeah there was so they're doing that thing where they help people and that just doesn't sound like Chris

890
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Anime

891
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,695
Not that nuts

892
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,743
Yeah that sounds wrong

893
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,023
Yeah so what

894
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
Some things that I'm actually I can't prove this and I I don't know

895
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
I kind of

896
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,935
Suspect that Alex

897
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
New when

898
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Arrivals

899
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
We're coming in to the station

900
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,103
Because there are a couple bus

901
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
The show up in the time that he's there not as many as

902
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
You would like you to believe

903
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,503
But I would guess

904
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,551
That there is a certain time

905
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
Intake happens

906
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,463
Sure some of his listeners at least have like sending emails it sit out

907
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,047
Okay at noon is when people show up

908
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:19,935
He shows up at the time when he is most likely to get the video that he needs

909
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
To make it look like it's just

910
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,031
Constant floods of buses

911
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Too lazy to stay there all day

912
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,359
Absolutely

913
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,967
42 minutes

914
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,367
The shirt is just wet t-shirt

915
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Anyway

916
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
They noticed something is a little bit different

917
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
From the last time

918
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,679
That stay where at this place antagonizing and bothered

919
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
Covid testing

920
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Area

921
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
And I would say that

922
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,311
Might be

923
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,103
Explained by another friend

924
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,175
Ramadan the BCP

925
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
Now the interesting thing is

926
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
When we drove in we noticed that

927
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
The covid testing site had been removed

928
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Okay

929
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
So before boarding

930
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
Controllers dropping them at the

931
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,671
The covid testing site

932
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
Then the Catholic charity here would walk up there

933
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Marshalltown

934
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,559
Marching into their facility get them plane tickets

935
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,119
And put them on planes to the interior of the United

936
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
State that covid test

937
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,423
Seaside

938
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
Is not removed

939
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
Which tells us now to naughty

940
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
Leaving testing for covid-19

941
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
So

942
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
Hundreds of thousands of illegals coming

943
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
Cross the border

944
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,431
Not being tested no background check be

945
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
Bean.

946
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Turkey Point at

947
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
A few months ago around here and we see the man putting

948
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Now

949
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,183
Reloading which is illegal

950
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
Again without child seat

951
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
The other vehicle

952
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Go as well

953
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
So yeah

954
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Dishes

955
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
Play total

956
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
Waving of the law

957
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,031
Really impressive how much of an upstanding citizen Alex's and I care so much about

958
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,103
Carseat accurate

959
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
Bringing in

960
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Children

961
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,991
Border to replace the white race

962
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,807
And they're not even using car seats

963
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Weird that you would think that he has a right to physically strike a person's car because someone wasn't wearing proper seat

964
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
It's particularly considering how in our last episode from 2003

965
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
He thought that car seat regulations were Trojan Horse and recreating gestapo teams of Greg uniform high school kids with machine

966
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:34,591
Seatbelts man says God damn seatbelt that's was going to do it I guess in the past 18 years he's just learned

967
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,919
Now you super in favor of micromanaging other people's decisions

968
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
I think it's great

969
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
Also

970
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
Everything that Tim is saying but the covid test

971
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Thing is made of

972
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,623
He has no idea what policy these people are following and he's just assuming

973
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,695
No one is getting tested but he couldn't demonstrate that at all

974
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,487
Also shouldn't kinako

975
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Care is anyone is getting tested

976
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,143
Like their whole pointed if not worth of the pandemic is a Hokkaido so I think it's a little disingenuous

977
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,519
Give a problem with immigrants not getting tested for something that you make money convincing your audience not to take series

978
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
You dick

979
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,359
Yeah there's that whole clip is just like what

980
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
We doing also

981
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,735
One of the other Hallmarks of this video on the main point

982
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
He's that

983
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
This Catholic charity

984
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Has rented out a whole nother building

985
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,975
Big building Arizona Hollywood fashion or something to eat

986
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
Store across the street from their charity

987
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
Not possible that there

988
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
Who is running people through covid testing in there

989
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,703
No they can't do it really

990
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
No

991
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Today's all the way across the

992
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
You could get covid on the way

993
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
To their they

994
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,735
It's got to be right off the bus there just making an assumption and Reporting it as

995
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,783
They're not testing anybody for

996
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,111
Anything it's it's outrageous that the sort of just leaps

997
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
But they're making an order to justify

998
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,975
What they're doing I mean the only difference

999
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,511
Between this and pizzagate is

1000
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
I mean I guess slightly less

1001
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
Implication of pedophilia

1002
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Or less

1003
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,519
Close ties to Hillary I think I do know like this is I think

1004
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
The other thing about pizzagate and this that is different

1005
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
Is

1006
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,431
What are the reasons that I was saying that is really difficult

1007
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
Go to watch this video made me mad

1008
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Is because you see the

1009
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
Yeah like with pizzagate is very abstract

1010
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
And sure

1011
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:27,487
Should I put crime scene photos liked Instagram post

1012
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
From like Comet Ping Pong

1013
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,303
Like had pictures of

1014
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,863
People in them

1015
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,423
Those were used as props for the conspiracy

1016
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,191
GameStop

1017
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
This video is really

1018
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,311
Alexander using these people who are in a desperate

1019
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,591
Situation A props

1020
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
To make his narrative

1021
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
End

1022
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,967
Dehumanizing of it is is really

1023
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Bastard

1024
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
By Alex

1025
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
And that is really difficult to experience

1026
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,135
Yeah I mean he's he's

1027
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Exploiting pain as

1028
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
You know like he's he's just

1029
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
I'm pretending that he's the one who's trying to help

1030
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:07,167
Oh yeah yeah that's its really really really just

1031
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
Taurus

1032
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
Alex notices that

1033
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
These people have

1034
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Disaster relief

1035
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Leaf written on their shirts

1036
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
Answer keep side

1037
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
It's to write a story about

1038
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Building

1039
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Disaster relief

1040
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
So you know

1041
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,039
The Texas governor has declared emergency

1042
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
What do you bet

1043
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,927
Imploded border

1044
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
That

1045
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Biden

1046
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Created

1047
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:37,375
We're going to have to look into this but

1048
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Again

1049
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,055
They created emergency

1050
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
And then they get all our tax money

1051
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
To credit even bigger emergency

1052
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
That's the plan

1053
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Exxon

1054
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Quotes

1055
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Disaster Zone

1056
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,695
Ozone

1057
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
On the back

1058
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
Of the vehicle

1059
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,703
Emergency Response Team

1060
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
But disaster Zone

1061
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,919
Set the Ender Alex on a placard that's in this vehicle this Advance back window

1062
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Response Team state saems

1063
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
Support vehicle

1064
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,783
I checked the utexas transportation

1065
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
Encoding this could mean a number of things and none of them are

1066
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Suspicious

1067
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,183
For instance of vehicle Gladys placard if it were a quote

1068
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,047
Vehicle use for law enforcement purposes that is owned or leased by a federal government at

1069
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,399
Or if it was quota county-owned or County least Emergency Management vehicle that

1070
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,215
Been designated or authorized by the Commissioner's Court

1071
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,287
You know it just gives the vehicle certain rights

1072
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
Like the ability to park places and not get ticks

1073
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,639
Or there's an actual emergency they can

1074
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,199
Exceed the speed limit or turn left in Notre Dame

1075
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
Intersection the vehicles likely owned and operated by the state of Texas and the

1076
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,927
Catholic Charities question as well as volunteers

1077
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,743
For helping with the process because we don't allocate enough fun

1078
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,303
Keep refugees safe for people like Alex

1079
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,143
This isn't a big mystery and the only thing suspicious in this equation is Alex

1080
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Said his behavior

1081
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
Let me put you on this idea

1082
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Alright I'm going to throw this out there

1083
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
What if

1084
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Alex

1085
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,383
Is the literal Christian death

1086
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Okay wouldn't it be

1087
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:30,527
Just like the literal Christian Devil's convince everybody it's crazy

1088
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,599
Expect somebody would be trying to fight the literal Christian devil

1089
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
See what I'm saying this is next level

1090
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,975
Well I have a I have a reputation to that

1091
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
Cuz we know from the Bible

1092
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:44,351
The devil can quote scripture

1093
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,727
And Alex cubis quote scripture quite a bit

1094
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:53,055
So

1095
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
Leave me to think that you could be wrong idea may have some holes

1096
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,783
So there's a bus

1097
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
The pole saw

1098
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,623
And there

1099
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
Alex and Tim

1100
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,927
Stand

1101
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,535
At the door of this bus essentially waiting for people to get off the

1102
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,607
Wow there should be security

1103
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
Get off the bus

1104
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,935
People don't disembark

1105
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,775
This could be the case you can see the one of the people inside the bus

1106
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
One of the guards or

1107
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
You know people who are escorting them

1108
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
I'll have some paperwork

1109
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:35,039
And it's possible there is need to get a couple things and get out there is some sort of a process

1110
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Need to go through

1111
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,391
That they would have done as people got off the bus but because of

1112
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
It's raining there doing it on the bus

1113
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:47,327
There's all kinds of explanations literally have to have a customs form

1114
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,447
That does happen is a someone from

1115
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,335
Aviva the Border Patrol shows up

1116
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,127
Is the people getting off the bus

1117
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:05,247
They were waiting for someone who would basically be like a notary public

1118
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:10,111
All these peoples arrival

1119
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,695
It's because they are there

1120
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,023
And these people on the bus who are the evil globalist

1121
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,047
Don't want

1122
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
There's something secret on this

1123
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
Bus that they don't want people to see.

1124
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,471
Something that I think is legit dangerous and awful

1125
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
They were doing it in the

1126
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
But now that we're here filming

1127
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
They don't want to open the bus

1128
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,271
13 don't want to dbus all these illegals

1129
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,575
But that's why it's so important for America

1130
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,719
They're going to wait because

1131
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
We're here in April

1132
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
You can tell that the media has not been cover

1133
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Illegal operation

1134
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
And nobody

1135
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
But now we all on Sunday

1136
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
What they said

1137
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
But now we show up

1138
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,511
And now

1139
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
To follow through with their plan

1140
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,351
Now they don't know what to do

1141
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,375
And that's why American

1142
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
Need to get out of their home

1143
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,447
You need to get in the streets

1144
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Need to come down

1145
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,263
No

1146
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
No

1147
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:36,895
Alex says absolutely so

1148
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
Totally signing off on this

1149
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,967
Call for people to

1150
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
To come stop

1151
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
Yeah

1152
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,343
Which certainly is not the kind of behavior that

1153
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
It's a good outcome

1154
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
Snuff

1155
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Also just

1156
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:55,327
Spoiler alert whenever the people do end up getting off the bus and they do not go through the back doors at Alex appointing to just made

1157
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
That up entirely off

1158
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
A bunch of bulshit

1159
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
That sounds like basically would have ghosts

1160
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,751
Hunting show sounds like

1161
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,567
You know like them just wandering around being like

1162
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
See they won't tell you about this this is a cold spot that has been

1163
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
Ghost hunting show

1164
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,575
They're never liked now we need a million people to come to this house

1165
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
Haha yeah there's more Danger

1166
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
There's an excitement

1167
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,095
That is involved in the improvisational storytelling Metallica's doing

1168
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,935
What he's doing is he's coming how do I take the

1169
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,727
The pieces of the things that I'm seeing

1170
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
Create

1171
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
What I would

1172
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:42,431
Do if I were trafficking people that's where they're going

1173
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:47,807
Him to traffic people and then assuming that that's how people would do it right and then ignoring it when

1174
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,111
The actual reality

1175
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Is counter to what

1176
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
Predicted Emily ignoring V

1177
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:58,815
Tunis of how he would do it successful that dumb plan with

1178
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Definition

1179
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,423
So I would say that watching this video

1180
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
It's

1181
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,495
Seems like people arriving

1182
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
At

1183
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:12,639
Compassion charity Center

1184
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,991
Bedlam

1185
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
Computershare this

1186
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
You are the Paul Revere

1187
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:22,879
Regal

1188
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,743
This video doesn't in any way to fix what I would call Total bedlam

1189
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
In fact

1190
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,375
Around this point the video I was starting to wonder how it could be possible that this whole thing

1191
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
It's like

1192
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
Conveyor belt

1193
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,751
Human trafficking where they deserve his huge flow of people

1194
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,799
Alex has been standing

1195
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
Yelling outside this bus for like five

1196
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,359
15 minutes

1197
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
And no one else has shown up

1198
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,455
Junior be like a bottleneck forming

1199
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,855
I mean if there's total Bedlam shouldn't you have in some way and inconvenience along the way to

1200
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:57,439
Minor inconvenience it's raining

1201
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,047
Somebody shouted 11-11-11

1202
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,447
This is all coming off intensely desperate if you so much attention the last time

1203
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:14,335
And bothered these charity people so I can recreate some of that magic to drive traffic to his site

1204
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,615
But this just isn't a click

1205
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,407
And one of the big towels

1206
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,711
About how we could attempt is to be seen Alex

1207
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:25,087
Does constant need to reassure himself that these people are doing something wrong because they don't follow seat belt rule

1208
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,647
Here's he's there

1209
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:33,023
Just hoping for a dramatic confrontation that makes him look like a big Brave strong American loving boy

1210
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
But he's not

1211
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,839
No he's just getting rained on

1212
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:40,703
And the people were trying to help refugees are sick of his bullshiting are not engaging with him

1213
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,519
My black walk back into the gun shop and apologized

1214
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,919
It appears Morgan all over again that's good let's do that again

1215
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:54,783
Maybach

1216
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
Come on guys we all did good on that right you probably got some more donations and I got Drive everybody

1217
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:06,047
When everybody wins let's make a fight so Alex exaggerated

1218
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Let's hear a little bit

1219
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,167
We are here in McAllen Texas to 20 minutes

1220
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,495
We've already seen more than six boxes for the Ford van

1221
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
Deliver

1222
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
And pick up

1223
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
Holding a few minutes ago

1224
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,015
Ali room into a huge facility that goes for 80 yards down

1225
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,039
Leaving come out

1226
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
Go to the bus station

1227
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
That is right down the street

1228
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
So

1229
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
Dawn

1230
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,863
I forgot there's another part of this video that like it doesn't play on audio well but like

1231
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,215
Someone tells him that a bunch of people just went down to the bus station

1232
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
I'm so there's a bus station that's like across another

1233
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,335
Street catty-corner from the charity

1234
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
And so he and the cameraman go down there like what

1235
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,735
There's nobody there

1236
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,807
They got away

1237
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
I don't know what's going on exactly but I know that nothing that he's saying actually match

1238
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,255
Matches the video that they're presenting

1239
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Courts

1240
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Alright

1241
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,863
Immediately border

1242
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,471
Disaster Response Team

1243
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
Arm

1244
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Driving these buses

1245
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Children

1246
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:47,167
That seems pretty extreme to be reporting based on

1247
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
The

1248
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
What what he shows

1249
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
It does not does not match

1250
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
That doesn't sound

1251
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,383
No Heartland response teams are in armed

1252
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
These children probably kidnapped

1253
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,527
Yeah and you can even hear him kind of struggling

1254
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:08,927
Describe it as you know he's trying to stay he's trying to improve his way into like an awful description of the

1255
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
Horror that he's seeing around

1256
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
And he's like

1257
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:23,007
Car seats the Optics of it doesn't match what he needs and so he's trying to escalated

1258
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
By way of Storytelling

1259
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
And it's just

1260
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
It's just saw that

1261
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
This week

1262
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,943
Alex finds the second bus

1263
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
And it's around the corner on the other side of the building and this bus has people getting off of it there's is worth

1264
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,903
Door back door front door

1265
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,279
Fox News

1266
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
Fox News to send a team down here

1267
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
We've been here 30 minutes

1268
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
Disappear out of the country

1269
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Busy people

1270
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,663
What barefoot

1271
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
Disappearing

1272
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,063
That's a blond-haired blue-eyed little boy

1273
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343
Hispanic

1274
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
Waiting on a baby

1275
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:21,887
This is a place where Alex has spotted a blond-haired has decided to assume that the woman he's with his ass

1276
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,167
Really nothing to base this on

1277
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,287
Mother's wearing a mask and he barely even looks at her as she walked past him so this is absolutely

1278
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Sense of Alex just

1279
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Deciding

1280
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,407
Improvise a story on the Fly where a white child is being smuggled by immigrant

1281
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,735
There's another child that our two saying is alone is

1282
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
Is there two different child

1283
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Children

1284
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:44,927
But if you watch the tape you can tell that he is actually with a woman and another child he's just a little bit older the kids

1285
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,487
He's walking ahead of them by the time Alex season

1286
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,559
Hey decides to use them as a prop for white nationalist propaganda

1287
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:56,959
Yeah that doesn't get much more white nationalist then just instinctively being like white kids stole

1288
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Going by somebody else

1289
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,055
This is a humanitarian crisis

1290
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,127
On the level of f****** every

1291
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,687
Knox

1292
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,759
And you know here's where this gets teachable

1293
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,319
So this is something that Alex sees

1294
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,671
And he's decided to make a big deal out of based on assumptions that he's making

1295
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
That are not based in anything

1296
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
Other than races

1297
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,511
Well yes

1298
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,815
But if you pay attention

1299
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
You can see the story changing

1300
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,703
That's a blond-haired blue-eyed little boy

1301
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Hispanic

1302
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Waiting on a baby

1303
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
I got it you got already

1304
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Gentleman

1305
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,223
You just see what I just saw it right there

1306
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,527
Wow

1307
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,319
We need to call the police

1308
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
Get over here

1309
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
We got to call the police

1310
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
I don't care what the

1311
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Call 911

1312
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,119
Blonde hair blue-eyed kid

1313
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
Hispanic women

1314
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Waterboy

1315
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
He gets convinced not to call the police

1316
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
Because they're like

1317
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,991
Can I do that

1318
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:17,087
Ephod enter 100% smuggling

1319
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,135
Radon details that Alex

1320
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
And keep straight

1321
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,183
Yep that are based on

1322
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,463
Again nothing but his

1323
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
So now if you look

1324
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
Immediately again

1325
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,119
The story changes

1326
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
IJustine

1327
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Fluid

1328
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
It's not based on anything real

1329
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,775
Discord

1330
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
Women with him

1331
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
One of those kids was barefoot

1332
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
Barefoot

1333
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
Barefoot you name it

1334
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,103
This is where paying attention is really important

1335
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
Jourdanton helpful

1336
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,431
What's the story is already changed twice

1337
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,503
Summer span of minutes after he witnessed this non-crime but he want

1338
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
How to call the police over

1339
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,391
Initially it was a blonde haired blue-eyed child who was with a Hispanic woman who couldn't possibly be as much

1340
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,975
Then it became a blond-haired blue-eyed child was with

1341
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
Nike women who couldn't possibly be his mother

1342
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,583
Now it's become a blond-haired blue-eyed child who was

1343
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,143
Unaccompanied minor arriving scared

1344
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
At the center

1345
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,031
The story is changing because Alex is trying out different versions of the story to see which feels best

1346
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,615
See what you can use to incite the maximum amount of fake outrage

1347
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Satan is audience

1348
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
He does this a lot and it's absolute

1349
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
Gut-wrenching to see him come faced

1350
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,271
The face of people who are in desperate need

1351
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,831
And then for him to use them as fodder for his dumbass

1352
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:56,159
Here's what's going on with this video and I should point out this

1353
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,487
Is painfully obvious if you just watch the footage that Alex posted

1354
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
There are two kids

1355
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,559
But Alex is talking about in mixed

1356
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:06,399
One of them is wearing a red shirt the other is a blue shirt and that's how I'm going to do

1357
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
Distinguish between the two cuz they're both

1358
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
I guess

1359
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Blue

1360
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:16,895
I don't know. Can't tell what their eye color is good

1361
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,967
I don't really know if it does hair

1362
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
To the end of the story

1363
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
The kid in the red shirt is the one that Alex initially started yelling

1364
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,975
The one who was he was convinced was with a Hispanic woman who couldn't possibly be as mother

1365
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
Alex just made this up and it's based on nothing

1366
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Thing at all this is a

1367
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,607
A group that goes in pets

1368
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
But that's with a red shirt

1369
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,495
A couple people in front of that kid in the red shirt is the kid

1370
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
In the blue shirt

1371
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,591
Use the child to be alone when he entered the charity building

1372
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Sing because he was walking separate

1373
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
From his mother

1374
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,455
If you roll the footage back to earlier you can

1375
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Can clearly see them walking together

1376
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,063
Is a woman carrying a child and

1377
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,671
The kid in the blue shirt does not act in the way that Alex is describing

1378
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:07,071
What do you approach has the door the charity he looks up as if to make a greeting to the guard who's holding the door open or have lunch

1379
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
And then continues in showing no signs of distress or

1380
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Confusion

1381
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:17,055
Alice's version of the story is completely made up and he's also mixing up these two different children that he saw walking to the charity because

1382
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,359
Because he knows that no one watching this is going to

1383
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Care they're not

1384
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
His audience isn't going to Lake

1385
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
Hey we just

1386
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,015
That's not what happened was it matter

1387
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,087
Does not matter

1388
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,903
Yeah I mean it's good that you can watch this

1389
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:38,303
Because it did you just hearing the little bit in the description I have blood dripping from my ears and I think that maybe that's

1390
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
What I have to offer

1391
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,911
Is the visit not yell at

1392
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,215
I'm doing great buddy

1393
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,311
So at this point Alex's

1394
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Gotten

1395
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,383
Something on tape I guess

1396
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
Any decides

1397
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
It's time for people to

1398
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
To follow seatbelt

1399
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
Alright

1400
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,751
Login

1401
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
There's just another box

1402
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Is this a

1403
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:32,831
Everywhere *

1404
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
Do some people came out of the charity and went to get in a taxi

1405
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
That was Park

1406
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
Tim decided to bother.

1407
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,535
After their desperate pleas to follow

1408
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Seat belt law fell on deaf ears

1409
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,375
You could actually see in Alex's face the wreck

1410
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,679
Recognition that he needed to try and save this thing

1411
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
The publicity stunt

1412
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,751
Is the U.

1413
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,567
Dishonestly comes off look for looking tremendously week

1414
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,895
Around 7 to constantly Retreat back to being a seat

1415
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,175
Spell snitch

1416
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
And that's where things got really depressing

1417
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Information

1418
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:07,903
You can kind of see Alex make the decision to Waddle behind this taxi and try to block it from moving because the last time he was bought

1419
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
Bothering this charity

1420
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,255
You got a ton of attention on social media for blocking that dude's car

1421
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
You can feel him trying to recreate the magic

1422
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,887
Pretend he's having another heroic moment

1423
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
It just Falls

1424
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
Completely flat

1425
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,007
There's a little bit sad but what I feel more is

1426
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
F*** his dude

1427
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,615
Is a 47 year-old man is putting all of these people's lives at risk

1428
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Prophet

1429
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,175
Do you know somebody saying is b*******

1430
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,199
He doesn't care about

1431
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:35,807
Seatbelts and he's making up a narrative about this unaccompanied white child in real time

1432
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,343
You can see him making it up

1433
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,439
He's betraying refugees arriving at a charity as an invasion and whether it's his

1434
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Explicit gold or not

1435
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,095
He knows that his actions are helping create a Target on this charity for harassment or violence

1436
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Planets

1437
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,959
F****** unacceptable and if the moment that I get to

1438
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Enjoy is Alex

1439
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,079
Thinking that he's going to have a big moment waddling behind this Taxi

1440
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
Is it being very sad

1441
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:05,759
And I did not working out I mean that's not a win but I'll take it

1442
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,319
Some sad music over that and really get some

1443
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
Pesos at the shop

1444
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,159
Freud of that pathetic

1445
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:18,559
I think he's trying to get these people like a mobster on tax

1446
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:24,959
Excavation elx reveal all of the other crimes app

1447
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
Alex

1448
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
The Eliot Ness

1449
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,359
Outlaws

1450
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,407
Yeah definitely

1451
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:36,223
Anointed himself seatbelt cop

1452
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
Collapse of the USA

1453
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,079
Mortal children not even seatbelt

1454
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Just disappeared

1455
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
It's okay

1456
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
What about

1457
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,575
It's honestly pathetic how much of this is Alex trying to pretend he cares about people using

1458
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
Seat belts are car seat

1459
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:19,487
Political beliefs actually require him to be strongly opposed to seatbelt laws which are really just an overreach of the

1460
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
The Nanny state

1461
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:24,095
Recognize here is that Alex knows that what he's doing

1462
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
When is wrong

1463
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:30,495
Do you know that he can't prove in any way that anyone he's in her acting with his doing anything illegal or even untoward

1464
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:35,615
He can't prove that anyone is being trafficked said he can't prove any kind of malfeasance on anyone's part

1465
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,431
Everything he's doing is about making assumptions

1466
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
In creating

1467
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Suspicion

1468
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
And baseless

1469
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
Being thrown around

1470
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
However

1471
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,111
Car seat laws are real

1472
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,207
He should be philosophically opposed to them but they're the only concrete thing he can

1473
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:54,303
Come up with to justify why he's there then why anyone should listen to him yelling

1474
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:59,423
The reason that he brings it up so much and this video is because it's legitimately all he has to work with

1475
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:04,799
And honestly I've seen no evidence of the video that Alex released that suggest that anyone is doing anything wrong

1476
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Even in terms of car seat

1477
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,127
Earlier in the video

1478
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,967
Rob do is gawking in the window of one of these transport van

1479
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:18,367
Alex keeps insisting I tell me that there is not video evidence of people in

1480
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Car seats

1481
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,231
This one actually does have it looks like one baby seat at least goddamnit

1482
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:29,631
Broadview what's again f****** taking sup

1483
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:35,519
Corporate representative do

1484
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:41,151
The official Vehicles barely do so I'm at least have appropriate car seats

1485
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,479
So don't lie one they looked in the window of apparently does have

1486
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:50,879
Alex is just going to have to file a complaint with the taxi company is blocking is insisting doesn't

1487
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:57,279
Is that it is that is that the end result Southpoint taxi company

1488
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,351
And I got somebody's Medallion taken away

1489
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:05,471
On the front lines against McHugh and the New World Order

1490
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,519
Bothering a taxi driver

1491
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
This is just overwhelmingly pathetic

1492
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,871
I want to bring this back

1493
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,199
Full circle because I think you might forget a little bit

1494
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,247
Of how this was presented

1495
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
By the time who now we listen

1496
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,879
Alex describe this video

1497
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
20mm

1498
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Ladies and gentlemen

1499
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
42

1500
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,631
This is going on

1501
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
2 miles from

1502
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,751
42 minutes

1503
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
3 boxes delivered

1504
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
McAllen has

1505
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,623
At least 7

1506
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,951
Bldg 180 yd long Warehouse when the

1507
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,279
For something you just see hundreds of women and children inside

1508
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,143
I'm standing there as a bus pulls up

1509
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Another bus around the corner

1510
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
People in cages what do I get to that

1511
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,127
People in cages with

1512
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
Private Mercenaries

1513
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,223
Catholic charity outfits

1514
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,271
Driving with guns

1515
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
30 minutes

1516
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
Walking around here

1517
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Mothers

1518
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,391
And get this

1519
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Blonde-haired

1520
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,695
Blue-eyed children

1521
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Without them

1522
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Without their father

1523
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
Security guard

1524
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
English

1525
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
I want my mother

1526
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,031
Please call 911

1527
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,335
Spider roll

1528
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,871
Closest with armor

1529
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
The complete fiction but it

1530
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
If the end product of what Alex

1531
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Did out on the street

1532
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,903
The raw video de posted on Infowars is actually the recording of a rehearsal

1533
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:36,767
Alex went out there to cause a scene and hopefully get a ton of attention again like he did last time

1534
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,375
Nothing really happened so he started raping about a child that he saw go into the charity

1535
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:45,471
Gradually he worked on the Beats of that story whether or not it worked

1536
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:51,871
You know for it to be a white child with a Hispanic woman or a child alone or with two women he was just trying to figure out what we

1537
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Work best

1538
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,199
And he came up with the optimal way to sell it to Azadi

1539
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,807
Having the whole I want my mommy thing is a really nice touch and go

1540
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,599
Completely made up but it doesn't matter

1541
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,415
Anyone would believe anything Alex says it's going to watch

1542
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,255
The video and not pay attention or not watch the video and just believe

1543
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,815
But he captured whatever he claims he captured

1544
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
It's just

1545
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,399
And and you can see by the way that he's focused

1546
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Sing this

1547
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Biddies

1548
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Very much

1549
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,031
Whiteness there's a waypoint

1550
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,335
Yeah that's that's a really great

1551
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:27,455
Description of it that rehearsal idea because yeah you can definitely hear the on the call it's so much

1552
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
More polished

1553
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,783
Like the the actual video of all things

1554
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,599
And what's more important is

1555
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Appetite

1556
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,695
45 minutes 45 seconds on of

1557
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
Yeah it's unfortunately it in some ways you know you take away the the evilness of

1558
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,143
You take away the disgusting

1559
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
Exploitation of these people out of it

1560
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,031
And you do see that there is a little bit of a creative processing

1561
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Involved

1562
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,639
When Alex Witnesses a child go in

1563
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,175
I can work with

1564
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Any start

1565
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,247
What's to try and figure out how to

1566
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,295
To do it and then you see the B

1567
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
Being presented

1568
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
To Eleanor

1569
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
This is this is kind of

1570
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,231
What I mean by the teachable moment

1571
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
That is available within this disgusting

1572
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
A mayor of a video

1573
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,911
You see this process and I seen Alex do this

1574
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
A number of times

1575
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,239
He doesn't on the show sometimes

1576
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,847
He does it when he's trying to figure out a way to spend something

1577
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
It's

1578
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,175
It's important to recognize

1579
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,711
How disingenuous

1580
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
Dishonest

1581
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
Transparent

1582
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
This is a huge just pay attention

1583
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:39,903
Yeah it makes you ain't make it you know it almost makes me want

1584
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
Okay so there's

1585
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
About 10 million

1586
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
Podcast

1587
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:48,863
We're creative people in La talk about how

1588
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,911
Great and creative they are

1589
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:54,751
And go through their creative processes and kind of like

1590
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
Where I come from

1591
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:02,943
Imagine if there was a right-wing f****** liar bulshit podcast mother likes well this is how I work

1592
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
Workout all of my b******* you know I'll take it to the border and I'll just kind of wandering around and scream for a little bit

1593
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,903
To be after all of their careers are over

1594
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,791
Yeah that would be fine honestly don't even know if it's a conscious thing

1595
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,631
Like I am I'm not positive that Alex knows

1596
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,911
That what he's doing

1597
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Is drying to heighten an Escalade

1598
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,775
And imagine scenarios that would be

1599
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:33,663
Exciting or enticing to the audience based on their picadillos

1600
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
I mean

1601
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,991
But it's tough to really

1602
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,295
Get into like that idea of somebody with

1603
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Almost instinct

1604
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
Tradecraft

1605
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,159
To them you know that that like

1606
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:48,767
I've just done this so much I've never actually been able to intellectualize it

1607
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
I simply do

1608
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,607
I think I you know I don't know I think

1609
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
I think a lot of

1610
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
People who do stand-up

1611
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,215
You go to open mic

1612
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,543
Again you perform and you like that didn't work

1613
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:05,151
Not necessarily your writing down on paper like a conscious process of how to fix the

1614
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,943
The joke you just kind of brute force it

1615
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,063
Just go over and over again and this b*******

1616
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,975
10000hours Andres valdovinos

1617
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:23,327
Full of s*** a****** ironic that the best way to describe his growth

1618
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
Is b*******

1619
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
So one of the things that I wanted to

1620
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,239
In some ways

1621
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:34,847
Is the last time Alex went down to this charity and harass them and bothered them

1622
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:41,247
A lot of people posted videos of it

1623
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
Out of

1624
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
I am

1625
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,063
Doing this

1626
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,671
In a lot of the traffic that he got out of it was people being like look at this monster

1627
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
And such

1628
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,255
Seem nearly as much

1629
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
This time around

1630
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,167
A part of it was because the Optics that Alex had are not useful for that another thing is is

1631
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Good

1632
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,519
Help him

1633
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
Yes is a trap

1634
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
This is a trap

1635
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,359
And unless you're going

1636
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,383
To take the time

1637
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Do

1638
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Experience

1639
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,199
Understand

1640
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,247
And help an audience understand

1641
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
What he's doing

1642
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,623
Don't post an out-of-context clip of him

1643
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:22,207
Bothering charity people and be like look at this a******

1644
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,743
It's only it only works

1645
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,303
To his advantage and he's aware of it and that's why he does things

1646
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
It's a game and a trap

1647
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
People like Alex Hughes

1648
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,239
Yeah I'm proud you have no idea that he was at the border

1649
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:40,639
That says a lot you know like people Roberts people share a lot of information with me and and

1650
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
You as well you know and that idea of it

1651
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,271
This whole thing happened with me completely unaware of it

1652
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:52,671
It's like back in the old days dammit when I just had no idea what you were going to tell me I would guess that if Alex like broke some

1653
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,231
I'm on the window or something like that you would have heard about it

1654
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
Actually succeeded in a lot like

1655
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,583
Finding the

1656
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
Temptation that he wanted

1657
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,191
Then there's a chance that people would have fallen for it

1658
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,007
But this was just so Bilk toast in boring

1659
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
That

1660
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
No one cares

1661
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,591
Yeah I mean his next stunt

1662
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,919
Has to be well it at the the start that you would

1663
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,711
Think it's the correct

1664
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
Escalation if I'm

1665
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
In the writer

1666
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:23,647
Your stone is going to get arrested

1667
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,719
Needs to do if he wants to pull a stunt

1668
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:33,119
And he should do some kind of minor bulshit that he knows he's not going to do real-time for the real question though is is

1669
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Sewing ready

1670
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,519
You know is is is there anybody who can be a temple while Alex's doing

1671
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,847
However long he's going to have to do like a week

1672
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:49,247
Before he gets released or now we do now I'm asking later this to another love

1673
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,527
Bible alright Owen

1674
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:57,439
Live in Folsom kind of situation has already whenever Congress

1675
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,231
While Alex is in prison

1676
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
Bohme

1677
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
I don't

1678
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:06,399
Albino about prison is I learned from Mark Richards

1679
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
I don't think they let you bring

1680
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
Podcast

1681
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
The freezer

1682
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:17,152
Hey if Johnny Cash could do it I would love love love it

1683
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,992
Owen started doing things work you would go visit Alex and prison visit

1684
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:24,576
Well they let me bring a pencil

1685
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:29,952
Alex's in touch with some reptilians and

1686
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:37,632
Full circle kind of closure that we could ever get Alex was telling me the other day but I was married to a rafter

1687
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
Princess Anne

1688
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,104
Can you imagine the narrative closer that that would provide that would be the end of our

1689
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,920
Ride off into the sunset

1690
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:54,016
God I want that door seals

1691
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,648
I think it is an interesting thought those like in terms of like what would

1692
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,720
Student escalation it would really have to be some kind of

1693
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:08,864
And Alex doesn't attempt on Alex's life in jail for something

1694
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,168
I got the rest of this stuff is kind of

1695
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,216
Italy

1696
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,288
Like you can go and get drunk on podcast and talk about his dick

1697
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
And like

1698
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:17,824
I don't know

1699
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
Before

1700
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:22,944
He'd go on Rogan and gelato

1701
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,016
Done that before 2 I think it's diminishing return

1702
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,576
I don't know what he can do

1703
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,880
He went to the border and he got

1704
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,416
A publicity stunt out of it

1705
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
Back in April or month

1706
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
What's ago whenever you did it

1707
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,280
Trying to go back to that well it's

1708
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
Dry

1709
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
Ironic cuz it's raining

1710
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,888
But it's dry to dry well

1711
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,936
I don't know what to do

1712
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,520
I mean

1713
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
You got to go

1714
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,824
You got to go somewhere enforcing

1715
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,688
You got to you got to go to to like

1716
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,528
Amaris house would be easy too because you

1717
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Could protest something

1718
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
Totally

1719
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,600
I mean people

1720
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,208
On the left get arrested for protesting all the time

1721
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,560
John protesting itself

1722
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,352
Yeah he could be good

1723
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,144
You know he has a lot of

1724
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,448
Wrong ideas

1725
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,472
He could protest

1726
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
In a legal fashion

1727
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
Peaceful resistance

1728
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
It's it's a sad school

1729
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Could drive a tank down Main Street

1730
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:32,064
They work out okay you know it's legal to own tanks

1731
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
Yeah I think we'll see I think it'll be interesting to see where they

1732
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,976
Things go in the future

1733
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
And

1734
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
It is it is woefully transparent

1735
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:50,496
I would say that anybody who's interested go watch the video and watch the kids that he is specifically talking about

1736
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,056
And see how that does not match up at all

1737
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
With the public face

1738
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
Narrative that he landed on

1739
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,664
After spitballing and trying to

1740
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
Figure out exactly how

1741
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,224
Best salad

1742
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:04,064
And if you can understand that you can understand a whole lot about how Alex

1743
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
Creates the narratives that he creates

1744
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
And why

1745
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
And about how the

1746
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
The entire right

1747
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Wing creates their proper

1748
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
Change shirt

1749
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,048
Translate

1750
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
Oh yeah

1751
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,608
Will be back on Monday Jordan

1752
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,656
And I'm excited somewhat

1753
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
To see how Alex deals

1754
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,472
With Rumsfeld

1755
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,752
Excited to see

1756
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
I mean he should hate Rumsfeld

1757
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
He does

1758
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,848
Yeah so

1759
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:31,200
I just don't know I don't know I could see him giving a glowing

1760
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,992
Eulogy to

1761
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:37,088
I don't think I don't think it'll be a glowing eulogy I think he doesn't

1762
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
There's no way

1763
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
You can like rocks

1764
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,720
But he also has

1765
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280
Built-up Rumsfeld is a giant global

1766
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
So like

1767
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:53,216
There's no way for this to be another Patriot assassination or whatever

1768
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:59,616
Impossible that would be like trying to rehab Karl Road

1769
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,456
What does end up transpiring what's Alec

1770
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
What's gets back

1771
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
From the border

1772
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:11,648
I will find out but until then Jordan Twitter
