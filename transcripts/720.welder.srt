1
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,530
Knowledge Fights.

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,154
Damn important.

3
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,442
I am sweating Knowledgebuy.com.

4
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:21,550
It's time to pray.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,850
I have great respect for Knowledge.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,438
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys.

7
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:27,874
Shang.

8
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:28,998
We are the bad guys.

9
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:29,790
Knowledge.

10
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,120
Knowledgefight.com.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,182
I love you.

12
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:00,070
Hey, everybody.

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,138
Welcome back Knowledge Fight.

14
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:01,478
I'm Dan.

15
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:02,582
I'm George we're dude.

16
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:07,210
Takes sit around, worship at the altar of Celine, and talk a little bit about Alex Joe.

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,614
Indeed we are.

18
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:09,310
Dan.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,734
Jordan, quick question for you.

20
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:15,850
What's your bright spot today? My bright spot today is Coca Cola.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,110
Coca Cola Classic or New Coke? Look, they have great taste in podcasts, so they decided to sponsor.

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,750
Of course, I was noted famously critical of their space flavor.

23
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,430
They came out with that space flavor.

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,282
I have no concept of a Coca Cola space.

25
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,640
You tasted it.

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,840
Wait, was it supposed to taste like space? Yeah.

27
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,750
Okay.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,290
That's right.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,286
Now I remember.

30
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:44,466
It's not memorable.

31
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:44,882
No.

32
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,240
And not good.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,790
The only way I could find that was in, like, a six pack of mini cans.

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,254
Right.

35
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,902
And they're still in my fridge.

36
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:55,454
I have no interest in drinking them.

37
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,162
Fair.

38
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:57,318
They're garbage.

39
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:04,110
But Coke put out another flavor called Dream World, which is supposed to be the flavor of dreams.

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,390
What? I'm sorry.

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,994
What the fuck they're doing? I guess it's some kind of viral marketing campaign.

42
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:13,050
It must get enough attention based on how dumb these ideas.

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,720
Yeah.

44
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,650
Or just, like, people talk about, like, hey, what's the flavor of space? Right.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:27,906
What's the flavor of a dream? I think they're dissecting Travis Scott's Astro World because that's a mixture of flavor.

46
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:28,250
Yeah.

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,586
Well, you've got space and you've got Dream World.

48
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,650
If you put them together, you got Astro World.

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,310
That makes sense.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,120
I think that Dream World was much more of a success.

51
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,186
Okay.

52
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,746
It's pretty good.

53
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:43,514
It's got a kind of a passion fruit kind of vibe to it.

54
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:43,826
Sure.

55
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:50,370
It has, like, a Coca Cola mixed with a sort of there's maybe a couple of fruits.

56
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,160
Sure.

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,598
Let me ask you the ultimate question, though, is did they achieve a taste that would remind you of a dream? I guess.

58
00:02:58,744 --> 00:02:59,198
World.

59
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:04,050
Do you dream of passion fruit? If so, right on the nose.

60
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,478
Okay.

61
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:05,078
All right.

62
00:03:05,164 --> 00:03:06,794
If not, then maybe not.

63
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:11,022
I have no interest in assessing the accuracy of these flavors.

64
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,650
I will just say that it's pretty.

65
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,214
All right.

66
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:17,320
Who is the taste tester for Dream World? I don't know.

67
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,358
The Dream.

68
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:24,822
He rewrites it anyway.

69
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:31,578
I appreciate that they salvaged what was left of a shattered reputation with the Dream World.

70
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:32,178
Yes.

71
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:37,050
What about you? For me, it's a new album out by JID.

72
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,974
Fantastic album.

73
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:39,486
Okay.

74
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:40,882
Excellent album.

75
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:50,698
It's one of those things where maybe only an outside critic can kind of look at someone and then accelerate it to a high extent.

76
00:03:50,734 --> 00:04:02,638
So this is like JID looked at Kendrick's last album and was like, what if I did the most Kendrick? And, like, Kendrick can do the most kendrick kids would say, hold my beer.

77
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:09,500
It's a little bit something that it's almost also a little bit of an homage combined with a little bit of a parody in a way.

78
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,942
He's taking out a lot of Kendrick and really hammering at home like he's changing time signatures every 5 seconds.

79
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,202
He's changing his voices.

80
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:19,938
He's got characters going on.

81
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,490
This is Kendrick as shit.

82
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,806
That's what he's doing.

83
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,786
And he's doing a lot of it right.

84
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,758
But it's really good.

85
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:26,094
Okay.

86
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:26,974
So it's a great album.

87
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:27,390
All right.

88
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,110
That's how it works.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,854
I'll check it out.

90
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:29,566
That's math.

91
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,194
I actually can't check it out.

92
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:31,710
Oh, yeah.

93
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,510
I've started to exercise again.

94
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,450
So I'm listening to a bit of music and I will say that I'm stuck squarely show tunes.

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,922
I don't think that would have pumped me up enough.

96
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:42,378
Okay.

97
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:49,486
Although I got deep into a bootleg copy of mama mia.

98
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:50,180
No.

99
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,046
Okay.

100
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:54,538
All right.

101
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:57,826
I think fall out boy, some of those hits are better than we remember.

102
00:04:57,948 --> 00:04:59,122
No, they're not.

103
00:04:59,256 --> 00:04:59,818
I'm going to leave.

104
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:08,186
This is a fallout boy ambassador song from snakes on a plane by cobra starship was all right.

105
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:08,810
Okay.

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,640
All right.

107
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,942
All right.

108
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:24,274
That does sound like it strikes a chord, so to speak.

109
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:24,994
It'll pump you up.

110
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:25,270
Yeah.

111
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,178
Anyway, Jordan, today we have an episode to go over and we're going to be talking.

112
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:32,650
I had to take a little breakie for dams.

113
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,610
Self care comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes and varieties.

114
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:51,962
I decided today I was going to go back to 2003 because I wanted something of substance to deal with as the middle of the week was going on.

115
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:54,650
It's just like sick of this bullshit.

116
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,086
I don't know, spinning wheels, rambling about other is going to be false flags before the midterms.

117
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:01,682
Sure.

118
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,938
She says all the fucking time.

119
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:06,674
Still can't believe he cares about the midterms right now.

120
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,982
It's pretty fun.

121
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:08,980
I guess.

122
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,102
It's something to talk about.

123
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:11,800
Sure.

124
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,154
That is a good point.

125
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:20,750
He can only say Claude Schwab so many times and promote his book so many times, which, by the way, is out.

126
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,926
I'm going to be getting that book and we're going to do that episode eventually, but that'll be fun.

127
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:29,342
Again, the self care I needed was something with meat on the bones, right? Yes.

128
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,786
And so we're back to August 6, 2003.

129
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,294
That's where we are in our progression through 2003.

130
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:37,854
It's been a while since we've done 2003 episode.

131
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,050
It's been a long time.

132
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,242
Yeah.

133
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:42,530
I scrolled back through the episode.

134
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,066
Yeah.

135
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,400
I'd say more, maybe.

136
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,406
Well, I mean, the trial got in the way, what have you.

137
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:56,018
But I'm very excited to go over this and discuss some of the bullshit that Alex was doing on this day back in 2003.

138
00:06:56,044 --> 00:07:00,390
But before we do that, let's say hello to somebody who wants Jordan.

139
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,874
So first, Conrad Zimmerman isn't a cult leader, but he does have novelty beverages and snacks.

140
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:06,542
Thank you so much.

141
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:06,930
Jordan.

142
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,742
Policy wonk I'm a policy wonk.

143
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,566
Thank you very much.

144
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:10,314
Thank you, Nick.

145
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:14,294
Getting stoned while wandering the canals of Amsterdam while listening to knowledge fight.

146
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:14,822
Thank you so much.

147
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,122
You're an I apology wonk.

148
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm a policy wonk.

149
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:17,870
Thank you very much.

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,710
That sounds great.

151
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,482
That sounds terrifying, too, in a certain way, yeah.

152
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:21,866
Next.

153
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,042
I don't know why Alex hates Brian Stelter.

154
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,914
The stray cat said some great tunes.

155
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,666
Thank you so much, you're an IP policy wonk.

156
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,662
I'm a policy wonk.

157
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:29,534
Thank you very much.

158
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:33,374
I know that I just said that Fallout Boy had some good songs, so I'm not one to talk.

159
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,270
I know, no credibility in this, but I disagree.

160
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,554
Okay.

161
00:07:36,592 --> 00:07:39,618
The stray cats did not nobody is going to argue.

162
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:40,382
Next.

163
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:41,718
This one late.

164
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:42,940
Sorry about that.

165
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,342
Happy birthday, monkeyskate.

166
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:46,194
Love Pumpkin.

167
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:46,802
Thank you so much.

168
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:49,034
You are now a policywomp I'm a policy walk.

169
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:49,958
Thank you very much.

170
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,134
Pumpkin did everything right.

171
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:51,738
Monkeyskate.

172
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:52,706
The one's on me.

173
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:53,354
Yeah.

174
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,994
And that poor turtle that Dan jumped on.

175
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:56,558
Thank you so much.

176
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:56,826
Jordan.

177
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:57,822
How a policy wonk.

178
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:58,842
I'm a policy wonk.

179
00:07:58,866 --> 00:07:59,714
Thank you very much.

180
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,734
We got a couple of technocrates in the mix.

181
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,102
Sure.

182
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:04,518
So, first, rock and stone.

183
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,330
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

184
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,430
And the macromancer.

185
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,362
Thank you so much, you are now a technocrat.

186
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:11,610
I'm a policy wonk.

187
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,910
I have risen above my enemies.

188
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,418
I might quit tomorrow, actually.

189
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm just going to take a little break.

190
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,520
A little breaky for me.

191
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:28,142
And then we're going to come back and I'm going to start the show over.

192
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,034
I'm the devil.

193
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:30,580
I got to be taking on this.

194
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,430
Fuck you.

195
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:42,798
I got plenty of words for you, but at the end of the day, fuck you in your new world order and fuck the horse you rode in on and all your shit.

196
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,886
Maybe today should be my last broadcast.

197
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,560
Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years.

198
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,940
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow and you never see me again.

199
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,280
That's really what I want to do.

200
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,426
I never want to come back here again.

201
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:03,100
I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air.

202
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,090
I'll be better tomorrow.

203
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,290
Thank you.

204
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,854
Now, jordan? Yes, Dan.

205
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:10,262
We have an out of context drop from today's show.

206
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,894
That's been a little while on this one, too.

207
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:12,554
It's good news.

208
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:13,626
We're getting back to basic.

209
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes.

210
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,810
Finding our route.

211
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,166
Yes.

212
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:17,200
I like it.

213
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,200
This is great.

214
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,478
Alex has very frequently talked about how big his audience is.

215
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,902
We know, conservatively, 10% of the world.

216
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:28,478
At least.

217
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah.

218
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,370
This was a new level of brag.

219
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:32,942
Okay.

220
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:36,462
Infowars.com now gets 6% of the web's traffic.

221
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:49,726
What 6%? So there's porn and then there's infowars and then there's, I don't know, banking information.

222
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:54,970
Almost one out of every ten page hip is in force.

223
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,360
Wow.

224
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:06,720
When you think about that, you think of those Google search results and they bring back a billion results in like, half a second, or whatever.

225
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:15,038
That means that roughly 10% of those are infowars articles of some sort, something along those lines.

226
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:24,926
I know that Alex says he has a lot of tentacles, and so maybe all of these websites, every porn site, is just a part of infowars on infowars.

227
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,450
Yeah, he's diversified.

228
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,510
Man, that does seem like a back door for some enterprise.

229
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,730
Come on, now.

230
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,830
So let's jump into today's context here.

231
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,222
Alex starts off the show with a major world news story.

232
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:44,738
And I don't say that facetiously.

233
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:45,526
I usually do.

234
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:49,260
Yeah, I think that there's actually a news story.

235
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,350
The evidence is coming out that the bombing in Jakarta was another globalist operation.

236
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:08,294
Again, the Saudis are saying the British are carrying out the bombings in Saudi Arabia to destabilize the country so they can create a crisis to offer their new World order solution.

237
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:12,058
The evidence shows that that is indeed a fact.

238
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:21,850
The preponderance of the evidence, new information is coming out about the original Bali bombing last year and the fact that the British and US.

239
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,598
Government were there carrying the bombings out.

240
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:32,974
So for some perspective, this episode is from August 6, and the bombing of the Marriott in Jakarta happened on August 5.

241
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:38,318
There is no preponderance of any evidence that's leading Alex to say it's looking like a globalist plot.

242
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,078
He just literally says that about everything.

243
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:54,778
Well, I was wondering what a globalist plot is in disregard, huh? Well, I mean, okay, it's a globalist plot, but what is their plot beyond just they decided to blow up this okay, what is the plot? So it goes like this.

244
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:55,294
Okay.

245
00:11:55,392 --> 00:12:04,642
The globalists are attacking sort of Western targets within Indonesia hotel chains, right.

246
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:19,354
In order to force the hand of the Indonesian government to playing along with their globalist takeover and crack down on the public, install a martial law station Indonesia, because as goes Indonesia, so goes the world.

247
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:22,214
Well, I mean, yeah, that is the classic SAG.

248
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:27,718
The sun never fell on the Indonesian Marriott chain, I believe is what it is.

249
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,534
So that is essentially the plot.

250
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:39,034
Yeah, the plot is to try and force the hand of the government to go along with fascism will blow up all your McDonald's, basically.

251
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:39,622
Got you.

252
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:48,926
Okay, so incidentally, these two bombings that Alex is talking about were connected as they were both carried out by members of the terrorist group Jamal Islamia.

253
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:53,894
Members of the group were convicted of doing a string of bombings in Bali.

254
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:57,406
There were a couple in that attack, sure.

255
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:01,738
And it's been pretty clearly established that they were behind the Jakarta bombing as well.

256
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:13,070
One of the more persuasive pieces of evidence that was found was the head of the suicide bomber, which was identified by multiple sources as being a man named Esmar Latinsani, who was a member of Ji.

257
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,610
I'm guessing Alex could just say that that was planted there or something, because he's smart and he loves facts.

258
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,102
Did you just say what I heard you say? We're going to be fine with that.

259
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:32,702
So the suicide bomber went into a hotel and blew himself up? Well, I believe it was a car bomb.

260
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,502
Okay.

261
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,306
Still.

262
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:42,490
Yeah, but of all the things that were intact, his head was identifiable? Yeah.

263
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
That's crazy.

264
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,400
Intact is a way to put it.

265
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,594
That's insane.

266
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:51,530
That's insane.

267
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,330
We're not talking dental records.

268
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,120
It literally sounds like somebody walked by and they were like, holy shit, it's him.

269
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,986
How have you been? Oh, no.

270
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,702
The rest of you is gone.

271
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:07,750
Yeah, it was other members of the group who had been arrested and identified.

272
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,390
Listen, I don't want to be morbid.

273
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:15,962
Right.

274
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,046
No, it is wild.

275
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:17,498
Yeah.

276
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,990
I mean, it is wild.

277
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:19,622
Okay.

278
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,630
No, I don't disagree.

279
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,674
That's wild.

280
00:14:22,782 --> 00:14:23,378
Yeah.

281
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:25,662
And that's probably why Alex would say it's fake.

282
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:26,390
Yeah.

283
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,094
I mean, that is ripe for fake ending.

284
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:29,678
Right.

285
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:37,778
Guess what? If you were going to do something fake, you probably wouldn't do something like that because your response is how people would respond to it.

286
00:14:37,804 --> 00:14:44,142
Sorry, what? Yeah, something a little bit more I would be very suspicious.

287
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:44,942
Yeah.

288
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:56,198
So, JAMA Islamiyah was a terrorist organization that operated in Indonesia and surrounding countries, mostly inspired by opposition to the more moderate forms of Islam that were practiced there.

289
00:14:56,344 --> 00:15:07,550
This was seen as a form of Western degradation, so they targeted things associated with the west, like the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta and that largely tourist area in Bali where the bombings happened.

290
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,090
Right.

291
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:14,990
The group had received funds from an organization called Alharaman, which is a charity that had clear ties to Al Qaeda.

292
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:26,114
Though Alharmaine did engage in a bunch of legitimate charity work, some of the funds were dispersed to terrorist groups like JAMA Islamia, which led to the charity being shut down in 2004.

293
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:26,942
Yes.

294
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:31,722
Al Haramin is a charity organization that is based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

295
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:34,590
The point is that Alex is legitimately just talking shit.

296
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:47,946
He hasn't had time to come up with any conclusions or weigh the preponderance of evidence, but he can't resist the opportunity to blame this tragedy on his imagined enemies and incorporate that made up story into his larger conspiracy worldview.

297
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:48,254
Right.

298
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:51,438
And so he's saying that there's a preponderance of evidence.

299
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:52,060
Right.

300
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,186
Just saying shit.

301
00:15:54,258 --> 00:16:06,194
I mean, I think this is interesting insofar as it feels like this is one of the few times where the plan in real life has been exactly as bad as Alex's fake globalist plan.

302
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:15,634
What do you mean? Tactically, I don't think that's going to achieve what it is that they think they're trying to achieve.

303
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:22,610
You know what I'm saying? Like, no one is going to care if you blow up a Marriott.

304
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,646
I think people did.

306
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,534
I think they did.

307
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:30,662
But, I mean, at the end of the day, a Marriott is like, it's a low level target.

308
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:39,862
You're not going to get what you want out of a Marriott? Well, conceivably one of the reasons to choose that is that it's frequented by tourists sure.

309
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:41,462
And foreign nationals.

310
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:41,830
Right.

311
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,526
And it would cause a reduction of western tourism to the country.

312
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:50,390
Possible western influence.

313
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,974
Possibly businesses would be scared of coming in.

314
00:16:54,072 --> 00:17:00,638
There are ripple effects that you could think might be achieved by attacking these western targets.

315
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:01,234
Right.

316
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:05,590
I don't know if I think that the idea is as bad as you are thinking it is.

317
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,280
No, I respect it's a terrible idea.

318
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:17,994
I can understand the thought process that gets there whereas no, actually it's as globalist plot is a lot sillier.

319
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,300
I think I see it.

320
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:28,720
This is just one of those plots ultimately that has been tried before and it doesn't really do it.

321
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,150
It's just not how you got to get a good one.

322
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,534
Well, hope springs eternal.

323
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:34,514
Yeah, that's fair.

324
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:35,846
They say that's fair.

325
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:50,934
So trying to nail down exactly like where this conspiracy comes from or what Alex is basing this on we get to one fairly relevant piece and we had calls yesterday from listeners.

326
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:51,986
Several on air.

327
00:17:52,048 --> 00:18:04,470
Several off air and a bunch of emails of folks that were watching CNN and Fox yesterday early in the morning after there had been a bombing in Jakarta.

328
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:18,820
The capital of Indonesia and they talked about how the US diplomats and US employees have been told to pull out 4 hours before.

329
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,454
Well, I have no way of confirming this.

330
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:32,490
I was getting emails, I believe it's true about it, but here it is now in Reuters and Sky News and in other Asian papers.

331
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:47,754
And of course the feds were on the ground within minutes just like the Bali bombing but with the Bali bombing two weeks before they had specifics of the attack and our government told the Bali's government and told the Taiwanese government.

332
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:58,494
This has been in the mainstream papers like the Straight Times not to warn anyone, not to tell the American people or the Australians or anybody else.

333
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:07,690
The Bali's government I think is Alex thinking that Bali is a I don't think it is a city state if I remember, province of Indonesia.

334
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,310
But Alex seems to I don't know what he's doing.

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:20,986
So it appears that what Alex is going to do to try and make this conspiracy stick is work with the idea that there was some kind of advanced warning of the bombings and that there were feds on the ground immediately.

336
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:21,762
Sure.

337
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:24,534
As always this stuff is partially true.

338
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:28,086
There were federal agents there, but not US agents.

339
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:39,574
There were two groups from the Australian Federal police who were working with the Indonesian law enforcement, one on a narcotics operation and one on an anti human trafficking task force.

340
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:45,366
They were able to respond to the bombings in Bali considering that they were already there in the country.

341
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:59,398
But this isn't suspicious and it doesn't prove anything close to a conspiracy or a false flag and again, this is related to the 2002 Bali bombings as opposed to the Jakarta bombing that just happened, that Alex is covering.

342
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:00,402
It is a different situation.

343
00:20:00,476 --> 00:20:04,354
He's playing fast and loose with these details a little bit, and I think it's intentional.

344
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:04,830
Yeah.

345
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:15,642
So there was some advanced warning, but that's not necessarily a thing where it was specific enough to guarantee the ability to stop either the Bali bombings or the Jakarta bombings before they happened.

346
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:18,090
In the case of the Bali attacks, the US.

347
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,322
Had captured Omar Alfaruk, who was understood to be a high level al Qaeda operative in the region.

348
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:29,166
His contact information had been found in the possession of a number of senior members of the group.

349
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,114
And after the US.

350
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:38,410
Forces interrogated him in ways that almost certainly bordered on torture, he talked and explained his role in the Southeast Asian cell of Al Qaeda.

351
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,150
The US.

352
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,138
Attempted to pass this intelligence on to the Indonesian government because part of it involved a reasonable suspicion that they were planning an attack somewhere near the anniversary of 911.

353
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,766
One of the recommendations that the US.

354
00:20:50,828 --> 00:21:02,470
Made was that the government should arrest a prominent cleric named Abu Bakar Bashir, who Alfarok had named as being someone who was involved in the organization and planning of attacks.

355
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,230
The political situation in Indonesia at the time was very tense, with a secular president.

356
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:16,590
Megawati Sukarnoputri, who is vice President hamzahas was said to have close ties with many of the radicals who the US.

357
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,634
Wanted to focus on, including Bashir.

358
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:26,480
So you had this vice president on sort of one side of things and a president who was on the other side.

359
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,554
It was like early America, where it would just be the top two voters get in.

360
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:37,578
So it'd be this guy, and then the guy who hates him the most on the planet is the vice president.

361
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,814
And it's a tough situation to navigate.

362
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:40,218
Right.

363
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:49,806
The country is majority Muslim, and Megawatti didn't want to make any arrests, particularly of religious figures without evidence of their having committed a crime, which the US.

364
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:50,886
Couldn't provide.

365
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:51,718
The warning.

366
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:52,326
That the US.

367
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:56,890
Had was too vague to be actionable, and the Indonesian government was somewhat in a bind.

368
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,974
Ultimately, the Bali bombings could not be stopped.

369
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:03,618
But afterwards, the Megawatti government began to act.

370
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:08,898
She arrested Bashir and charged him with a string of church bombings that he had been involved in.

371
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:11,850
That occurred on Christmas Eve, year 2000.

372
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,498
Got you.

373
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:20,962
In the lead up to the Jakarta bombing, australian federal police were still in the country because the government had asked for their assistance investigating the Bali bombings.

374
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:37,702
In the course of that investigation, many members of JAMA Islamia were arrested and questioned, and a picture began to take shape that another bombing was being planned, but no one provided a specific target that they were planning to hit, just that it was likely that the group would attack a soft target.

375
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:38,178
Right.

376
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,774
If that's all you have to go on.

377
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:49,006
You can be on guard somewhat, but you can't possibly deploy the resources necessary to protect every soft target in the country, or even all of them, just in Jakarta.

378
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:58,170
Well, I mean, yeah, it is a warning that says bombing is coming, but without where or what or how to stop it.

379
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,770
So you're like, well, yeah, but what do I do with that? Right.

380
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,142
Yeah.

381
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:13,220
And the notion that a soft target would be chosen isn't really that much new information or revelatory because the original bombing was of a bar.

382
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,274
And even then you kind of get the sense that that's in the Mo.

383
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:20,814
Sure.

384
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:32,310
But I mean, even then, that's not really good intelligence there because, like, oh, well, you could just be assuming that they're going after a soft target or you don't even really know what a soft target to them quite.

385
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,682
Is.

386
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,994
How soft is soft exactly? It's tough to call.

387
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:36,702
Tough to call.

388
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,274
The point here is that Alex just saying shit.

389
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:40,806
Nothing he's saying means anything.

390
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:44,202
And he refuses to take responsibility for the things that he says.

391
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,970
He just throws shit at the wall and then moves on to another room for anyone.

392
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,626
Can make him clean up his mess.

393
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:54,654
None of this has any connection to the reality of the situation.

394
00:23:54,812 --> 00:24:01,882
He's blurring details intentionally or because he doesn't know any better about two different incidents.

395
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,740
I mean, you don't even understand.

396
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,880
He's got people on the ground with the Bali's as we speak.

397
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:13,462
government.

398
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:17,398
He declared Bali its own country.

399
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:22,090
Obviously, Steve is notably part of the Bali sovereignty movement.

400
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,746
That would make sense.

401
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:27,082
So Alex has some other news stories he wants to hit on.

402
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:36,014
So remember that article from yesterday, the London Guardian? Saudis accused British staff of destabilization campaign.

403
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:45,970
British Embassy staff and Riyadh have been accused by the Saudi Arabian authorities of coordinating a campaign of anti Western terrorist bombings in the kingdom.

404
00:24:46,410 --> 00:25:08,678
The Guardian has learned the accusations of the British Embassy in Riyadh, according to the bombings to stabilize the Saudi regime is the latest and most bizarre piece of information to escape the hall of Secrecy behind which the Saudis have been conducting legal proceedings against seven Westerners who they say have been tortured into making false confessions.

405
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:16,510
So I said day one, before the story ever broke, that the evidence is it was the British doing this.

406
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,182
Wow.

407
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,306
So this wasn't a story that was in The Guardian the day prior.

408
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:25,334
This is an article from September 6, 2002, in the aftermath of the Bali bombing.

409
00:25:25,382 --> 00:25:25,918
Right.

410
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,882
Whenever they did know stuff about a thing.

411
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:29,350
Yes.

412
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,450
The basic gist of the story is this.

413
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,770
In November 2000, a British citizen named Christopher Rodway was killed in a car bombing.

414
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,238
He was an engineer employed at the military hospital in Riyadh.

415
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:47,040
And in the immediate aftermath, the Saudi government said that this was not terrorism, but was actually more likely a personal matter.

416
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:56,294
At the time, Saudi Arabia had a public stance that it was very insistent that they did not have any terrorist elements existing in the country, and this would contradict that narrative.

417
00:25:56,342 --> 00:26:01,370
So there was an attempt to find another explanation when personal reasons didn't stick.

418
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:07,690
A bunch of employees at the British Embassy were accused of carrying out that bombing with the goal of blaming the Saudi Arabian government.

419
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:15,386
Seven people were held in prison for long stretches, treated quite poorly, and a couple of them were actually sentenced to death before ultimately being released.

420
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:27,914
This is a story that Alex is completely wrong about, and if you would just go a little bit further down the story he's using as a source, the credibility of these accusations being made by the government of Saudi Arabia might seem a little shoddier.

421
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:37,802
Quote a Guardian investigation this year discredited the case against the men and uncovered evidence of systematic torture by the Ministry of Internal Interior officials.

422
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:47,654
According to defense papers submitted by way of appeal to the Saudi Supreme Court last month and seen by the Guardian, the men were systematically tortured until they confessed.

423
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:56,126
They were subjected to sleep deprivation for up to ten days at a time, suspended from chains, hanging from hooks above their cell doors, and repeatedly beaten.

424
00:26:56,258 --> 00:27:02,366
They were told their relatives would be harmed if they did not cooperate and were offered early release in exchange for confessions.

425
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:10,082
At this point, I want to make totally clear that I'm opposed to this treatment of detainees in the same way that I'm against how the US treated Omar Alfaruk.

426
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:19,706
In the latter case, it was interrogation tactics like sleep deprivation, whereas the allegations in this case are far more abusive and gruesome.

427
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:24,626
The fact remains that these are abusive and unacceptable on both accounts.

428
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:27,658
And I'm not trying to minimize one compared to the other or anything.

429
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:28,814
They're both unacceptable.

430
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:29,542
Yeah.

431
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:34,582
Beyond the moral issues, putting someone into distress is not a reliable way to gather information.

432
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:38,206
You may end up getting intel if it's accurate, but you also might not.

433
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:45,158
So it's often it's best practice to not view the fruits of tortured interrogations as being trustworthy.

434
00:27:45,314 --> 00:28:04,586
So the reason that I gave this much more of a pass in the case of Alfaruk than in the case of the Saudi government blaming these British citizens is because there were other corroborating details and pieces of supporting evidence in that case that didn't come from Alfaruk himself.

435
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:04,966
Right.

436
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,970
And it appears that the things that he told the US forces were accurate.

437
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:15,660
They did their best to verify that information, as opposed to just going, oh, we tortured him enough that we've got the correct information.

438
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,562
All that being said, this is all terrible and awful.

439
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:20,002
Yeah.

440
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:28,474
In early 2004, the British Embassy workers who were tortured and forced to admit to crimes they didn't commit on video began the process of trying to sue the Saudi government.

441
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:32,386
The rules at that point in the UK were that you couldn't sue a sovereign government.

442
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:34,642
But their case sought to challenge that law.

443
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:40,378
They actually won a case on this in 2004, but it was ultimately overturned by a higher court in 2006.

444
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:55,778
And so they did not get to what a weird world that we live in where you can just get swept up into something that has nothing to do with you and then you're tortured for like that's absurd.

445
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,710
It is very dumb.

446
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,726
That just exists and we all participate in this system.

447
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,950
Very silly reading.

448
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,542
Some of the folks experience, not so much.

449
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:18,670
I mean, obviously tales of being beaten and the experience of having your government not have your back or feeling like that.

450
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:30,434
I mean, how could you affect yeah, there's some interesting expressions of the trauma that lingers that's added to by like, well, there's no recourse.

451
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:32,100
No, there's not really have.

452
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:37,654
It is like a hurricane just swept through your house and that's it.

453
00:29:37,812 --> 00:29:39,442
A hurricane just swept through your house.

454
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:44,280
Now you have to live with it by it's fucked up.

455
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,410
Undoubtedly.

456
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,162
Yeah.

457
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:51,070
So there was something that Alex touched on a little bit.

458
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,918
He said that they pulled them out.

459
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:56,074
They pulled people out hours before.

460
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:56,734
Yeah.

461
00:29:56,832 --> 00:30:04,330
And some of that was not entirely clear based on the pieces of information and the sources that he was citing.

462
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,130
He gets back to that and there's a little more clarity.

463
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
There's another one.

464
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,870
US planned withdrawal of Indonesian staff hours before blast.

465
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,002
And this is out of the Jakarta news.

466
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:31,270
Hours before the powerful blast in Bali Island went off, the US had reportedly announced a plan to withdraw its administrative staff from Indonesia for security reasons.

467
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,686
Do you have these two stories interconnected with Bali and with Indonesia? It's the same story over and over again.

468
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:43,462
So this story actually makes total sense if you understand the larger context of what's going on.

469
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:49,474
It's only suspicious if you're only given access to the sparse details that Alex covers on his show.

470
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:57,182
The sparse list of the details is actually a strategic aspect of Alex's broadcast because he's not interested in giving his audience a better grasp of news events.

471
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:03,158
He's just trying to find tiny slivers of information that he can use to make every event conformed to his predetermined storyline.

472
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:07,800
So everything fits neatly into the globalists are behind everything box.

473
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,962
This article that Alex is talking about is from late 2002.

474
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:22,142
The context of this is that the US intelligence community had gotten information from Alfarouk and other sources that there was a plan in motion to carry out a bombing in Indonesia.

475
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:27,590
Areas or buildings that were seen as Western are prime targets for groups like JAMA Islamia.

476
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,750
So they had every reason to suspect that embassies or government buildings could be under threat.

477
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:40,214
The US had tried to relay this information to the Megawatti government, who found themselves unable to act on it in a way that satisfied.

478
00:31:40,262 --> 00:31:44,258
US concerns, which left few options on the table for how to proceed.

479
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:53,006
Evacuating staff temporarily is a completely justified and rational decision to make in this situation and it's definitely not caused for any kind of suspicion.

480
00:31:53,198 --> 00:32:04,690
Alex is trying to use this sliver of information that the US had considered evacuating embassy staff prior to the bombing to insinuate that they had specific foreign knowledge of the attack, but this doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

481
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:14,522
It's also kind of dumb considering that if they did have foreign knowledge of the attacks targets, they wouldn't have had to worry about officials at their offices.

482
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:20,534
The primary target of that attack in Bali was Patty's Pub, a bar that was frequented by tourists.

483
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:25,198
Though there was a smaller bomb that was detonated at the US consulate office as well.

484
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:25,786
Sure.

485
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:32,782
One person there sustained minor injuries and it happened around 11:00 p.m., so most people probably weren't even at that office.

486
00:32:32,976 --> 00:32:38,186
According to the Australian police report, the consulate bomb in Bali was packed with shit.

487
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:44,890
So the thinking was that this was less aimed at killing people or causing destruction as much as it was a statement bombing.

488
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:45,634
Yeah.

489
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,638
You fill a bomb with shit whenever you're trying to cover everybody with shit.

490
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:51,900
I feel like that makes a perfect yeah, that makes sense.

491
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah.

492
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,170
So this doesn't work.

493
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,802
Alex is again trying to apply it more broadly to the bombing that he's covering that day.

494
00:33:03,876 --> 00:33:04,150
Sure.

495
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,546
And it's not appropriate.

496
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:06,240
Right.

497
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:21,120
He's found places that are geographically close and then it's been like, well, obviously all boundings happen in this geographical area, happen for the exact same reason every time and every detail about circumstances are exactly the same.

498
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,600
Just sort of transpose things and it's fine.

499
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,538
That is a really interesting failing.

500
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:32,090
That kind of goes under the radar with a lot of his conspiracies.

501
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:41,846
Like it is impossible to pull off the same job the same way over and over and over again like that unless you're the globalist.

502
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:51,430
But I mean, that was too suspicious that they never fuck up in unique and interesting ways, they're always able to pull it off.

503
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,066
Yeah.

504
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:53,242
That's crazy.

505
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:54,180
Yeah.

506
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,660
Your enemy is perfect.

507
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,280
Whatever.

508
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,560
The enemy of good is perfect.

509
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,590
You're making up your enemies.

510
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,742
Of course.

511
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:08,560
Right.

512
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:13,874
Your enemy has the power that you need them to have at any given point in time.

513
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:16,518
It's narrative convenience.

514
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:17,306
Right.

515
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,354
It's like having a main character shield, like that kind of thing.

516
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:20,846
Yeah.

517
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:22,026
Main enemy shield.

518
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:22,730
Yeah.

519
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:30,402
So Alex goes on to make up more details about this article that I think is just the way he does this is just fascinating.

520
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:41,922
And it goes on to say yesterday's blast, however, may prove to be just the evidence Washington needed to force Jakarta to come down hard on Muslim civilian groups.

521
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:52,850
In the past analysis did not rule out the occurrence of deliberate violence across the archipelago to provide a pretext for US intervention.

522
00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:00,770
Meanwhile, Indonesian House of Representatives Speaker Akbar Tongjun said that he regrets the US.

523
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,030
Government's decision.

524
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,890
And again, it says the US.

525
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,790
Government ordered its employees and embassy staff pull out of the Marriott 4 hours before the blast.

526
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,394
Very astute timing.

527
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:18,534
So this is a complete fiction that Alex is creating out of this article that he's reading.

528
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:23,846
This article was written long before the Jakarta bombing at the Marriott and had to do with the US.

529
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:26,618
Threat to remove embassy employees in 2002.

530
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:28,734
Prior to the Bali bombings.

531
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:29,522
The US.

532
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:35,694
Didn't end up evacuating staff, and it had nothing to do with that Marriott, which is the hotel that was targeted in Chicago.

533
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,062
Right.

534
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:40,730
The reason that Indonesian House Speaker 10 June was expressing regret with the US.

535
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:48,434
Decision to threaten to remove staff was because he was worried about the message that would send to the rest of the world that Indonesia wasn't a safe place to be.

536
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:51,722
He was concerned with the country's reputation, which makes sense.

537
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:52,142
Right.

538
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,002
Alex has no idea what he's talking about.

539
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:55,370
He's reporting that the US.

540
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,354
Plan to evacuate staff hours before the bombing that happened in August 2003.

541
00:35:59,392 --> 00:36:03,938
And his sources, an article from October 2002 that is an issue.

542
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:07,878
This is the level of work that he does, or at least that's how it appears.

543
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:12,818
Well, I mean, because he's actually conflating sources together.

544
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:13,454
Right.

545
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:15,170
He's making a stew.

546
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,940
The whole here is, what amount of US.

547
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,070
Officials were at the Marriott.

548
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:49,906
Why is the United States government specifically listen? Obviously, it would be like they know that the embassy isn't going to be bombed, but who else was staying at the Marriott that needed to be evacuated? Well, the Marriott did host some events sure, in the past.

549
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:57,790
It is a little bit like the United States government is like, hey, listen, Eric, you got to get out of that Marriott.

550
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:04,586
I know you've been staying there for a week until we find you a place closer to the office, but you got to get out of there, Eric.

551
00:37:04,658 --> 00:37:10,078
Well, see, here is where this stew aspect comes from.

552
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:10,366
Sure.

553
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:10,762
Right.

554
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:18,074
So Alex has this story from 2002 about the threat to remove embassy employees.

555
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:18,370
Right.

556
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:27,394
And now he's bringing in they're saying that they were told to get out of the Marriott naturally, which can't be involved with this article because it's from about the US.

557
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:27,818
Embassy.

558
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:28,198
Right.

559
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:32,426
So he brings in another article that's a good idea to bridge the gap.

560
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:33,914
Not even bridge the gap.

561
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:36,646
He just jams them together into the same thing.

562
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:42,262
Okay, very astute timing again.

563
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:42,610
US.

564
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,690
Embassy canceled the booking of Marriott Hotel four and a half hours before the explosion.

565
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,214
US.

566
00:37:48,252 --> 00:37:51,698
Embassy canceled the booking of the Marriott Hotel before the explosion.

567
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:57,850
There was something interesting happening just hours before the explosion shot the JW Marriott Hotel.

568
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:07,622
So this is a bit of a pivot point, because Alex, up to this point, has been relying on this October 2002 article to argue that the embassy was threatening to withdraw staff.

569
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:13,874
That was true, but he was lying about the context of it and pretending it was a recent article related to the Jakarta bombing.

570
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:20,446
Right now, he's using a completely different source to make a completely different claim while acting like it's the same story.

571
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:22,714
Apparently what happened was that the US.

572
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:27,422
Embassy canceled reservations at the Marriott four and a half hours before the bombing.

573
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:33,662
Alex's sole source on this is a translation of an Indonesian website that makes this claim.

574
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:38,410
And their only source is an alleged employee of the Marriott who is anonymous.

575
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,782
There's no evidence that this is the case.

576
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:53,410
If I were the embassy and I were orchestrating elaborate fake terrorist plots in order to force the Indonesian government into cracking down on terrorists and going along with my larger global agenda, I don't think I would cancel those reservations.

577
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,558
It would keep them and just not show up.

578
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,250
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

579
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:06,394
Or even better, some of the expendable people who worked at the office could show up for the reservations and then the embassy could apply even more pressure on the Indonesian government.

580
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:06,994
Hold on.

581
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:11,770
When was the booking for? What's up? I mean, they said they canceled a booking, right.

582
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,926
But it didn't say there was an event at the hotel that day.

583
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:16,966
They could have been a booking for any time.

584
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:22,270
The implication is that it was like they were supposed to check in four and a half hours after that.

585
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,920
Sure.

586
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:25,174
Or that day or something.

587
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:26,386
Right, that's a great thing.

588
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,634
But he doesn't say no.

589
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:28,474
That is a great point.

590
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,074
Yeah.

591
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,618
And Alex will play with that a little bit later.

592
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:32,026
Okay.

593
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:39,720
But it is a little bit like if I'm planning a false flag, as you said, I'm going to leave those there.

594
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,578
What are you going to say? Listen, if we let it go too long, they're non refundable.

595
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,450
Okay? Right.

596
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,530
We got them.

597
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,420
Exactly.

598
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,550
They have a million come on.

599
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,970
And if it's a thing where the reservations are supposed to start the next day, they have a 24 hours cancellation policy.

600
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:07,058
I'm not sure if it's different for the USM, but if they have a special deal, budget is tight for the United States globalists in Indonesia, they got to pinch pennies.

601
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:14,302
Or if they're supposed to be there like that day or whatever, a bombing takes a while to plan.

602
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:14,614
Yeah.

603
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:24,310
You should know it didn't come together exactly 4 hours before I forgot to cancel it last minute.

604
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:39,010
So there's literally only one scenario where this makes sense as proof of a conspiracy, and that's the world where the evil globalists behind this plot canceled the reservation so they could leave behind a calling card for the conspiracy theorists to find.

605
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:57,226
This is basically Alex pretending that information is taunting him, which you have to realize is a part of the way he views no, of course, it is difficult to keep in mind that he does feel as though he's fighting the Mad Hatter, leaving clues behind at the scene everywhere he goes.

606
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:57,900
Yes.

607
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,790
Like the globalist or the riddler.

608
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,878
They're using puzzles.

609
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:05,040
Yes, exactly.

610
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:10,646
If I figure out all these clues, then I'll find the treasure underneath the United States Constitution.

611
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,758
It makes perfect sense.

612
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:19,294
And you and I are pointing out these problems with the idea of them canceling reservations as being a silly idea.

613
00:41:19,392 --> 00:41:19,942
Right.

614
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:29,326
And that's even accepting the framing that they did, in fact, cancel these reservations on that day, which I do not know to be true.

615
00:41:29,388 --> 00:41:29,758
Exactly.

616
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:33,610
I don't think that there's a solid piece of information about this.

617
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,902
Yeah, no, it doesn't work.

618
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:39,742
If they were there and they left, maybe.

619
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:42,530
But even then, it's at the Marriott.

620
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,330
I don't know.

621
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,902
That's what Alex says.

622
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:51,430
We've got the Saudi Arabians accusing the British government of carrying out the bombings and destabilize the region.

623
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,502
You've got the US.

624
00:41:54,576 --> 00:42:04,020
Government with its employees who checked in hours before the bombing, then check out just a few hours later.

625
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,870
Alex doesn't have another source.

626
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:11,738
This is just him embellishing and making up details about the idea that the embassy canceled reservations at the Marriott before the bombing.

627
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:12,118
Right.

628
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:17,938
The Flimsy article that he's basing this on doesn't say any of this, but he can't help himself from escalating things.

629
00:42:18,084 --> 00:42:19,946
Now, they didn't just cancel reservations.

630
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:26,234
They were actually there and checked in, but they went through all the trouble to check out hours early before the bombing.

631
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:30,962
Alex is making this up, because if it were true, it sure would seem pretty suspicious.

632
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:34,200
I suppose you even if they were there.

633
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,930
But even then, that's, like, flimsy ass shit.

634
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,358
It certainly would raise more of an eyebrow than right.

635
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:43,322
The other details.

636
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:45,874
But now it is a little bit like they check in.

637
00:42:46,032 --> 00:42:54,142
They call in, and they're like, hey, can we get an early check in? Because we got to the Marriott too soon? And they go like, yeah, okay, fine.

638
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:55,414
We've got a room available.

639
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,242
So they go through the whole rigmarole.

640
00:42:57,266 --> 00:42:59,218
They've left a credit card and an ID.

641
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:00,410
They've done all this shit.

642
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,702
They go up to the room and then like, oh, fuck, I forgot we got the bomb today.

643
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:05,866
They run down there.

644
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:07,334
They have to make a fake scene.

645
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:08,498
They have to make a big scene.

646
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:11,218
Oh, my room wasn't as clean as it needed to be.

647
00:43:11,304 --> 00:43:14,222
How dare you, sirs? I demand a refund.

648
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:15,442
And then they leave.

649
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:23,302
It's conceivably the dumbest track of events for you to actually believe happened.

650
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:24,154
It's not great.

651
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:25,486
No one would go through this.

652
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:26,606
It's absurd.

653
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:27,718
But here's the thing.

654
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:31,726
Basically, Alex can't make compelling arguments based on the information that's available.

655
00:43:31,788 --> 00:43:37,442
So he's cheating by just making up shit that makes his case look stronger, and he's doing this because he's a liar.

656
00:43:37,526 --> 00:43:57,382
Yes, it does, though, right? Because once you establish the idea that you had these embassy people there who checked out, and you added to believing the Saudi arabian government about the British folks who were carrying out bombings to destabilize the Saudi arabian government.

657
00:43:57,516 --> 00:44:03,326
You can combine this all together, and now you have a hit team at the marriott.

658
00:44:03,398 --> 00:44:14,618
All right, it turns out the government had inserted a team of, well, it looks like 20 people or more what? Into this marriage.

659
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:17,282
They pulled out just a few hours before the blast.

660
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:24,660
And maybe it's just a coincidence they just so happened to pull them out when they were going to be there for two more days.

661
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,338
How do you know that? Because of the threat that's happening.

662
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:37,226
And of course, it turns out that the bali bombing they told the Taiwanese not to warn the bali's government, bolt the bombing.

663
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:39,982
You can see here Alex is building out the story.

664
00:44:40,116 --> 00:44:42,274
He has a flimsy source that claims that the US.

665
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:47,866
Embassy canceled reservations hours before the bombing took place at the marriott, which he is now reporting as the US.

666
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:51,550
Sending in a team of about 20 people who are pulled out early.

667
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,830
This is solely from his own imagination, and it's nothing more than him writing his own little story about this tragic event so he can use it to further his own goals.

668
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,678
One thing I want to draw special attention to is the part where he says that they were pulled out of the hotel because of threats.

669
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:15,746
This is important because it's a synthesis of this flimsy source about the canceled hotel reservation and that article from 2002 about the lead up to the bali bombing.

670
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:26,330
Alex is taking the hotel detail from one story and mashing it up with the embassy being concerned about threats, that detail from the other story, and then serving it up for the audience as if it's something meaningful.

671
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,754
And it's the same thing.

672
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:29,950
If anything, this is an abuse of information.

673
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,914
And it's kind of silly to pretend that what he's doing is questioning world events.

674
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:35,342
Yeah, this isn't questioning.

675
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:42,274
This is just lying about shit so mass casualty events can be incorporated into your worldview more easily and you can profit off them.

676
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:42,900
Right.

677
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:58,390
It is funny that throughout this entire time, I find myself trying to give advice to the globalists and then realizing again that what I'm really doing is just in a writer's room with Alex, trying to punch up his narrative.

678
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:05,098
Like, a team of 20 is too big, too many people are going to that's too big, it's too obvious to see.

679
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,498
And then I realized, I'm not talking about this.

680
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:10,654
I'm with Alex being like, okay, listen, here's what we got to do.

681
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:16,094
He took that from the article about the canceled reservations that alleged that there were ten to 20 rooms.

682
00:46:16,142 --> 00:46:16,570
Right.

683
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,682
So that's just a number that he's coming up with.

684
00:46:18,696 --> 00:46:24,226
Yeah, why not? The reservation was apparently for three days, although it doesn't specify which three days.

685
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:26,422
And so that's where he's getting the two more days thing.

686
00:46:26,496 --> 00:46:26,770
Sure.

687
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:34,738
But he's just cracking those details into his own form, whatever shape he wants them to take in order to make his story make sense.

688
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:42,600
Now, what I think is more interesting with your writerly instincts is the way that you have been one step ahead about narrative right.

689
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,614
That is interesting about going back to the past.

690
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:53,346
He does have those abilities.

691
00:46:53,418 --> 00:46:55,238
It does feel like he's building something.

692
00:46:55,324 --> 00:47:08,114
There is a little bit of an A to B to C with the way that the layers of the conspiracy are added on as he make stuff up about the little kernel that is at the base of it.

693
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:10,442
It feels like he's trying yeah.

694
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:13,062
It's not good effort.

695
00:47:13,146 --> 00:47:13,394
No.

696
00:47:13,432 --> 00:47:16,106
But it is an effort which we're not used to seeing in the present.

697
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:16,794
Holy shit.

698
00:47:16,842 --> 00:47:17,270
Right.

699
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,086
Yeah.

700
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:30,086
It's transparent if you take the time to pay attention to it, but if you don't, or if you just operate off headlines and the optics of seeing a headline that says, us.

701
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:35,118
Embassy canceled reservations four and a half hours before the bombing.

702
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:40,506
And then you accept whatever Alex says about it if you just accept the story that he tells about that headline.

703
00:47:40,578 --> 00:47:41,210
Sure.

704
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,054
The escalation of it does make sense.

705
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:50,150
Or if you believe the Saudi government about the British Embassy employees right.

706
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,538
That they tortured and got false confessions out.

707
00:47:52,564 --> 00:47:53,140
Right.

708
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,302
These things.

709
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:54,650
Yeah.

710
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,170
There is a conspiracy that is crafted.

711
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:09,674
It's a little bit like a kid improving a book report where you're like, okay, I know you didn't read that book, but I'm actually kind of respecting your level of creativity and faking that you read that book.

712
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,034
You're making up some fun shit.

713
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:11,366
Sure.

714
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:17,094
It's like if a kid improvised a book report that was super disrespectful to a bunch of people who died in a bomb.

715
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:17,786
Right.

716
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:18,710
Yeah.

717
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,530
That would be where the Redford Grows is actually the Civil War burial ground.

718
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,042
Yeah.

719
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:27,806
That's a really worse book.

720
00:48:27,928 --> 00:48:31,842
So Alex doesn't just stay on this topic all episode.

721
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:34,118
He also just yells about stuff, too.

722
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:34,514
Sure.

723
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:40,298
It's death squads, folks, and that's what Homeland Security and the National Police are.

724
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:42,194
That's what the SWAT teams are.

725
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:45,714
They're setting up death squads in America.

726
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:51,614
It's in Patriot Act one and two, to be able to come and kill you and never even tell people why they killed you.

727
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:55,790
Never charge you, never indict you, never arrest you.

728
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,550
I mean, this is textbook classical tyranny.

729
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,938
We're going to take calls, and I got a bunch of other news we're going to get to toll free number to join us.

730
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,694
So that's a little severe.

731
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:06,662
Yeah.

732
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:17,810
I think that you could make an interesting argument that in some ways the police are acting as not always, but sometimes do operate as a death squad.

733
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,462
I think that's not what Alex is talking about.

734
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:20,846
No.

735
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:24,086
Alex doesn't seem to really have that much problem with police brutality these days.

736
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:27,966
Kind of the issue so it rings a little hollow.

737
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:34,406
I mean, if you are putting together an Alex Jones was right clip, I don't understand why that's not on there.

738
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:39,278
Unless well, because Alex it doesn't work in the present for his own that narrative in the past.

739
00:49:39,304 --> 00:49:39,962
Exactly.

740
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:44,630
And it's not worthwhile for him to really hang his head on.

741
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,122
Can't go back.

742
00:49:45,136 --> 00:49:45,906
At least brutality.

743
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:46,780
Not now.

744
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:47,814
Too late.

745
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:50,630
You have to defend too many people on the left.

746
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,830
He can't do that.

747
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,720
No, he has to literally be above the left right paradigm in order to do that, and he's absolutely not.

748
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,814
So in this next clip, Alex goes to calls.

749
00:50:02,922 --> 00:50:03,338
Sure.

750
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:07,970
And unfortunately, a caller asks a question that Alex was not prepared for.

751
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:19,478
What does DARPA stand for? It's the Advanced I've got to dig it out, but it's the Advanced Military Research System.

752
00:50:19,624 --> 00:50:21,770
Okay, thank you very much.

753
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,720
You bet.

754
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,622
When you hear somebody talk about DARPA, they start with Advanced.

755
00:50:26,646 --> 00:50:33,906
They never put the data, but it's the Defense Advanced Research Agency.

756
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:34,622
There you go.

757
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:35,740
Forgot the P.

758
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,886
One of the things I thought was really interesting about that first of all, that was not a gotcha question.

759
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:42,422
The caller was not trying to stomp him.

760
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:43,850
He was just interested.

761
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,346
And Alex should know that.

762
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:56,510
The thing that stuck out in my mind was that, like, on the stand in Alex's case, when Daria was testifying, they asked her what DARPA stands for.

763
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,170
She knew.

764
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,660
Yeah, that is true.

765
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:06,798
In 2003, Alex would fumble around with, what does DARPA stand for? Yeah, that's weird.

766
00:51:06,954 --> 00:51:10,286
If that was scripts, he would have heard that ding real fast.

767
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:13,610
I understand what does Harpa stand for? Advanced.

768
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:17,094
I understand if you would have trouble with, like, Harp.

769
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:17,510
Sure.

770
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,562
He doesn't talk about Harp that much.

771
00:51:19,636 --> 00:51:24,590
I don't know what has come up, but DARPA is like and he's in the middle of like this.

772
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:35,210
It's been a while since we've done a 2003 episode, but he just had that whole thing about how they were trying to gamble on terrorist attacks and stuff, set up a stock market on deaths.

773
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,770
It's pretty front and center of his narratives.

774
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,090
If you're a conspiracy theorist, you should have DARPA on the ready.

775
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,446
He should be caught on his back foot.

776
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:45,842
Yeah.

777
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:49,454
If you're a math teacher, you have to be able to do long division in your head.

778
00:51:49,492 --> 00:51:52,254
Like, you have to you can't fumble around with that shit.

779
00:51:52,302 --> 00:51:53,810
Otherwise, no one respects you.

780
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,370
So Alex takes another call, and this is the level of discourse that's going on on this show, man.

781
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,834
It's heady stuff.

782
00:51:59,932 --> 00:52:00,554
Okay.

783
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:03,422
I wanted to get your opinion on a couple of things.

784
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:12,278
I was reading that on August 27, mars is going to be closest to the Earth than 60,000 years.

785
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:15,340
Yeah, it's going to be the closest to Earth 60,000 years.

786
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:19,070
We know much these globalists are into the occult.

787
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:24,506
We do know that opinion about if that has any significance or not.

788
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:25,420
Absolutely.

789
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,270
I don't believe astrology, I don't believe in quackery.

790
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,818
But the globalist.

791
00:52:34,914 --> 00:52:38,466
Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton.

792
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:39,618
They got shamans.

793
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:41,210
They're doing Seances.

794
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:45,438
They admit they run off of astrology.

795
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:46,300
Exactly.

796
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,562
And I keep meaning to mention this.

797
00:52:49,576 --> 00:52:59,130
I'm glad you brought it up with Mars, the closest it'll be in 60,000 years, that's in humankind's history, folks.

798
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,730
In 60,000 years.

799
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:10,734
These guys are totally obsessed with numerology, what that portends the astrology.

800
00:53:10,902 --> 00:53:13,610
And that's why they're moving so hard.

801
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,294
And it is very dangerous.

802
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:27,494
Go ahead and do you think that they would celebrate that day with another attack? Is that what you need to be looking at? I don't make predictions on things like that when they don't have enough data.

803
00:53:27,592 --> 00:53:37,694
But I have to admit that reading about it and then seeing over the last year, we've been worried about August 24 when it will be the closest to Earth it's been in 60,000 years.

804
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:39,890
Okay, all right.

805
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,042
That is amazing.

806
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:45,700
I don't make those kinds of predictions, but I mean, look, that's amazing.

807
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,618
That is amazing.

808
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:54,402
To go from not knowing a thing to suddenly just being like this thing is central to reorder.

809
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:56,378
Yeah, we're terrified of this thing.

810
00:53:56,464 --> 00:54:05,800
Oh, is that true? I've been crunching the numbers and then there's a preponderance of evidence that Mars is going to be mars is a god of war.

811
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,630
That is true.

812
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,586
That was an event that did happen.

813
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:20,290
Right? I just appreciate that instantaneous.

814
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,080
Absolutely.

815
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,666
Is that something we should worry about? Absolutely.

816
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,190
You bet, brother.

817
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:31,350
You just fill in the blank if there is something you're asking Alex, if you should be worried about it.

818
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,438
Absolutely, brother, you nailed it.

819
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:35,850
There is a reason to be afraid.

820
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:42,042
You are not crazy for having this fear of something that nobody has literally ever thought before.

821
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:43,386
You are right, my friend.

822
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,422
Let's kill minutes of valuable time on my show.

823
00:54:46,496 --> 00:54:50,730
Talking about being worried about Mars being too close.

824
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,590
I don't know, celebrating.

825
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,940
Celebrating what? Mars being close.

826
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:58,314
That's another problem here.

827
00:54:58,412 --> 00:55:02,420
You didn't explain how this is related to an occult situation.

828
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:08,480
You're just like, oh, I bet because Mars is close this time they're going to be like, this is important.

829
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:14,158
I'm hearing the words you're saying, but you sound dumb.

830
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:16,040
It makes so much sense.

831
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:24,600
You reveal yourself to be a mark when you ask questions like that.

832
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:37,762
It's just understood that the globalists bomb things when planets are close how much closer? How much closer? It couldn't be that much.

833
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:40,442
It's not like a million miles closer.

834
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:44,770
On this one day I think it was quite a bit closer.

835
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,130
Much closer.

836
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,386
I don't know, I don't remember.

837
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:50,266
I looked it up, but I don't remember the exact right.

838
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,534
I didn't look up if there was any bombing on.

839
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:53,074
Sure.

840
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:56,340
Well, you had to the Little League World Series to play that.

841
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,494
Maybe some boss yes.

842
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:02,674
Maybe some home runs were hit that shouldn't have necessarily made it out.

843
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:03,202
Yeah.

844
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:10,490
Gravitational pull of mars right over the rafters, running track power got a little bit stronger.

845
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:29,580
Yeah, I mean, look, this is just dumb, but yeah, it's interesting that you have that response of like, why would that even be something that the globalists are interested in? Because to me, I mean, I'm joking around, scolding you or making fun of you, but to me that makes total sense.

846
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,150
It's just a little bit closer.

847
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:36,254
Yeah, there's magical powers.

848
00:56:36,302 --> 00:56:47,546
Okay, but if that's the case, then it suggests that as markets further away, something else changes that makes you less likely to celebrate.

849
00:56:47,678 --> 00:56:48,010
Right.

850
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:56,306
It being further away than Venus gets closer or is it just a day? Is it just like, oh, this is like a solar eclipse.

851
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:58,810
They all go outside, they look up and they're like, oh, look at that.

852
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,286
And then they go back to their lives.

853
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:02,940
Oh, no, they can see a solar eclipse and then they got to bomb something.

854
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,146
You got it.

855
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:06,034
That's right.

856
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:06,900
Yeah.

857
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,102
It is so much your cavemen.

858
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:14,566
Just like anything is aside, just like, oh, there's a shooting star.

859
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:17,350
That's a sign Mars is a little close.

860
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,190
That's a sign.

861
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,270
It is such that it is just caveman thought, that's all it is.

862
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:34,242
Well, and Alex takes kind of a simplistic understanding of symbolism, occultism and just applies it sort of universally.

863
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:34,574
Right.

864
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,786
a date that has doubled.

865
00:57:49,858 --> 00:57:54,882
So it's like March 6, 2009, three, six, nine sure.

866
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:56,960
Very suspicious date.

867
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,560
Magical powers on this date.

868
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:01,806
I like that.

869
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:07,640
One thing that's never really addressed is how many holidays occult people have to have.

870
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,140
It is every day there is a holiday, there's something.

871
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:16,002
Take away the bombing and we should all live like that.

872
00:58:16,196 --> 00:58:20,014
Every day is special and worth celebrating, but not everyday.

873
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,818
Mars is the closest it's going to be in 60,000 years.

874
00:58:22,904 --> 00:58:23,634
No, that's true.

875
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:31,990
It's going to be 59,900 and something years before we get that again someday.

876
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:35,898
And look at it, because there will be a bomb in 59,000 years.

877
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:36,990
We know that.

878
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,610
Put it on your calendars.

879
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:45,270
So, Alex, we know that his dad was a big JBS guy and bad influence on him.

880
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,070
Turns out his uncle wasn't better.

881
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,058
My uncle really is an expert on the new world order.

882
00:58:50,084 --> 00:58:53,634
He's got it for years and I had an argument with him about five years ago.

883
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:59,334
I said, yeah, the new order is going to set up a B system and biometrics, but I said, It's going to take time to do that.

884
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:04,398
He said, no, they build it, they lined it all up, they get it ready and they announce it.

885
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:07,434
And boy, how true his knowledge on that is.

886
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:08,454
That's what they do.

887
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,014
They set the whole thing up.

888
00:59:10,052 --> 00:59:18,478
We go, Gee, what's behind these curtains? They lift the curtains and it's a total dehumanizing, satan pit.

889
00:59:18,574 --> 00:59:19,830
Oh, how interesting.

890
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,930
We're in it, ladies and gentlemen.

891
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,354
I like that image.

892
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:29,762
Like a goblin feast or demon feast.

893
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:33,494
It is a dehumanizing Satan pit.

894
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,782
And his response to that is interesting.

895
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:38,230
Yeah, well, that is interesting.

896
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,210
I would like to know what that is.

897
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,930
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you we are in the Satan pit.

898
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:47,786
Okay, so you trip and you fall into the dehumanizing Satan pit.

899
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,400
I don't know.

900
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,582
I'm trying to visualize this.

901
00:59:59,656 --> 01:00:00,280
Right.

902
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:05,790
I appreciate first off, my favorite visual is lifting up the curtain to reveal a picture.

903
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:06,926
That's just great.

904
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:07,778
That's good show.

905
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:08,418
But ship.

906
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:09,160
Okay.

907
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,338
If you open a curtain to a pit, it's good stuff.

908
01:00:12,424 --> 01:00:12,746
Yeah.

909
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:13,480
All right.

910
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:16,780
What's in the pit? It could be anything, man.

911
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:21,162
I mean, there's got to be more than one Satan in the pit.

912
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:24,410
First off, there needs to be multiple Satan's in this pit.

913
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:29,354
Is that possible? I assume he can split himself up.

914
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,778
He's got classic Marvel powers these days.

915
01:00:31,864 --> 01:00:32,210
All right.

916
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:32,860
Right.

917
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,300
Sure.

918
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:36,158
Yes.

919
01:00:36,244 --> 01:00:37,430
Not my favorite.

920
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,630
This is like, the argument that Alex and his uncle had.

921
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,782
Yeah, probably.

922
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,718
I think that's cousin Buckley's.

923
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:45,102
Dad.

924
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:45,686
Oh, yeah.

925
01:00:45,748 --> 01:00:47,282
That would be my guess.

926
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,658
Because he's definitely someone who Alex has brought up before.

927
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:53,020
Right? He talks about uncles with information.

928
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:54,758
So fun.

929
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:55,682
Oh, yeah.

930
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:59,606
There's another news story that Alex touches on here.

931
01:00:59,788 --> 01:01:04,470
Bush picks new Selective Service director Crawford, Texas.

932
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:10,000
President Bush has picked a former lobbyist, an exmarine, as a record of the Selective Service.

933
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:14,126
Bush said Tuesday intends to nominate William A.

934
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:16,420
Chatfield for the post.

935
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:23,750
The Selective Service would provide manpower for the military of an emergency force to draft.

936
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,486
They've got all the bills lined up now.

937
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:29,022
One more terror attack, universal Draft.

938
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:35,594
It collects young men's names through the Selective Service registration system to try to change the law for women.

939
01:01:35,752 --> 01:01:43,010
Chatfield is currently a government relations consultant with Kindness and Chatfield Associates in Washington.

940
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:48,350
So that's real nice.

941
01:01:48,520 --> 01:02:03,822
And all the things where people talk about how accurate Alex is, they seem to just forget his constant obsession with how a universal draft was right around the corner and how the globalist had it set up so the next time there was a terrorist attack, that was it, and all your sons and daughters were going to be conscripted.

942
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:05,174
Yeah, big whiff on that.

943
01:02:05,212 --> 01:02:08,270
And he brings it up all the time.

944
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:08,858
Yeah.

945
01:02:09,004 --> 01:02:15,318
One wonders if Alex made a big stink when Trump nominated Donald Benton to this position in April 2017.

946
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:19,770
If that was evidence of Trump trying to reinstate the draft, I would imagine it wasn't.

947
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,654
I don't think he probably even noticed.

948
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:22,130
Yeah.

949
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,662
This is a small government office that has existed since World War One and could probably just be abolished.

950
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:31,050
Even though it's not a pool for a draft.

951
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:42,878
The names and information gathered from Selective Service registration are used by the Joint Advertising, Marketing, Research and Studies Program out of the Department of Defense, which uses that information to recruit volunteers into the.

952
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:48,614
Armed service anyway? Is there anything not evil? It's not cool.

953
01:02:48,712 --> 01:02:49,442
Right.

954
01:02:49,636 --> 01:02:52,922
But there isn't a draft, and there wasn't one in 2003.

955
01:02:52,996 --> 01:02:55,118
That being said, let's just access office.

956
01:02:55,264 --> 01:02:55,898
Get rid of it.

957
01:02:55,924 --> 01:02:56,954
Yes, get rid of that.

958
01:02:57,052 --> 01:02:58,000
That's bad.

959
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,326
It's obvious there won't be a job.

960
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:03,170
We can barely afford the military we have now.

961
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:14,238
Can you imagine if we just had an influx of, I don't know, 10 million people just to walk in there? How much would it cost to outfit them? We've got to spend a trillion dollars on one plane.

962
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:22,082
I kind of understand the thinking of something like this in past days.

963
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:29,642
Although I think that there is a social contract that has come into place that is we will never have a draft again, ever.

964
01:03:29,716 --> 01:03:36,386
No, that is not something that is going to be seen as appropriate on any level.

965
01:03:36,568 --> 01:03:42,590
And because of that, I think it would be a show of good faith for the government to get rid of this office.

966
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,118
Yeah.

967
01:03:43,204 --> 01:03:49,098
Because there's this premise of it that is like, in case we need this registration brick glass.

968
01:03:49,194 --> 01:03:49,886
Right.

969
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:53,750
Go ahead and get rid of that because you're not going to need it because we're not doing a draft again.

970
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,338
Yeah.

971
01:03:54,484 --> 01:04:04,962
Well, it is always a universal step towards fascism whenever you have a standing army at the call.

972
01:04:05,156 --> 01:04:08,734
Like part of that idea of hypothetical army.

973
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:15,690
Well, no, I mean, the current standing army that we have, the part of that hypothetical draft is you're not really supposed to have an army.

974
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:20,718
So everybody has their own skin in the game, so to speak.

975
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:26,194
And now it is kind of an impunity, and that's kind of part of our agreement.

976
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:30,560
We don't have a draft, and then we'll look the other way whenever you start wars all the time.

977
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:33,594
We can go ahead and get rid of that part of it, too.

978
01:04:33,632 --> 01:04:34,578
Yeah, that would be nice.

979
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:36,510
Get rid of most of these offices.

980
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:45,654
So, look, Alex in the present day, talking a lot about being broke and being in debt and he needs money.

981
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:46,400
Yeah.

982
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:51,294
I have found the first time he ever said this, okay.

983
01:04:51,392 --> 01:04:51,870
On air.

984
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,950
The very first time.

985
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,074
Well, I mean, if you believe what he's about to say.

986
01:04:55,112 --> 01:04:57,222
Oh, so he says, to be honest got you.

987
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:58,398
And I have to do this.

988
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:02,166
I've never done this in five years, not one year.

989
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:07,038
I am with a shortwave bill, and Jim Shepherd's been helping me.

990
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:09,094
So it's paid to the shortwave outlet.

991
01:05:09,202 --> 01:05:12,860
I'm about $15,000 behind.

992
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:25,350
Folks, we need you to simply buy the videos, let you make copies of them, and buy the books and buy the products from sponsors like Jim Shepherd.

993
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:38,358
Because when I have a sponsor that covers part of the cost and I cover the other part of the expense, very important that that sponsor be supported, especially when they got a real product.

994
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:39,198
That's amazing.

995
01:05:39,284 --> 01:05:41,098
I don't mean to make this a long rant.

996
01:05:41,254 --> 01:05:48,598
I'm not going to start doing this all the time, but I want to keep reaching the people in that French village.

997
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:53,250
I want to keep reaching the people in hiding in Indonesia.

998
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:59,026
I want to continue to reach people in Japan and in the Highlands of Scotland.

999
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:01,074
Jim shepherd, good to have you on the show.

1000
01:06:01,172 --> 01:06:03,166
Always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.

1001
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:08,660
And I'm sorry you had to sit there while I went to that diet ride, but Alex, I really respect the way you do things.

1002
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:17,334
May not know this, but several times I've mentioned to you, alex, maybe you got to give next response on there.

1003
01:06:17,492 --> 01:06:25,782
And invariably what you tell me is, jim, I'm not going to turn my show into an infomercial, into a merchandise and infomercial, I'm not going to do it.

1004
01:06:25,796 --> 01:06:28,650
I want to get the news out, and that's my primary objective.

1005
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:29,874
Wow.

1006
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:30,534
Yeah.

1007
01:06:30,632 --> 01:06:38,926
That's kind of a bummer, that to hear someone else say back to him in the past, bad news, Jim.

1008
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:39,630
Yeah.

1009
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:47,350
Jim largely a marketing infomercial.

1010
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:48,946
Yeah.

1011
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:50,798
He's the water filter sponsor.

1012
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:51,142
Right.

1013
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,190
So basically it's just the introduction of an infomercial.

1014
01:06:54,750 --> 01:07:03,914
With this, I'm behind on my shortwave bill because we pay for airtime on the shortwave station.

1015
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:04,438
Sure.

1016
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:07,270
And my water filter guy helps pay that bill.

1017
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,314
So here he is by his water filter.

1018
01:07:09,362 --> 01:07:23,040
It does seem very difficult to square someone saying, you know what? I like that you don't do infomercials and you've got the integrity to not turn your show into anyways, my water filters are the best.

1019
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,498
I agree with you.

1020
01:07:25,644 --> 01:07:29,230
It does bear mentioning that it is not as intrusive at this.

1021
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,110
No, of course it's not the whole show.

1022
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:32,494
Right.

1023
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:36,214
It's at least like, all right, here is a chunk that they're doing.

1024
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:41,302
And it's pretty transparent that this guy is selling his shit right now.

1025
01:07:41,316 --> 01:07:46,310
At the same time, a lot of Jim's sales pitch for his water filter is about the evils of fluoride.

1026
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:46,774
Sure.

1027
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:51,434
And so there is still, like, content that's being used as marketing.

1028
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:51,766
Right.

1029
01:07:51,828 --> 01:07:53,990
So there's still that blurry distinction.

1030
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:54,554
Poncon.

1031
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:54,814
Yeah.

1032
01:07:54,852 --> 01:08:05,640
But, man, it is a far cry from the deterioration into Infomercial City and leaving behind the information that Alex becomes later.

1033
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:12,000
I appreciate most of all that $15,000 number.

1034
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:18,058
I feel like potatoes when you look at Alex, but I feel like that's where you got to stay at.

1035
01:08:18,084 --> 01:08:22,198
The $15,000 is important to you, because then look at him now.

1036
01:08:22,224 --> 01:08:23,710
He's got shell companies.

1037
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:31,870
He's got to have accountants willing to lie for him, and then he's got to have accountants that his accountants lie to in order to launder their lives.

1038
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:32,326
Right.

1039
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:34,646
Like, that is a web of bullshit.

1040
01:08:34,718 --> 01:08:35,338
Think about this.

1041
01:08:35,364 --> 01:08:36,418
He's just got a bill.

1042
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:40,418
He's in such dicey legal situations that he has to be friends with Barnes.

1043
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:41,098
Yeah.

1044
01:08:41,244 --> 01:08:43,894
All you've got to do is pay your short wave bill.

1045
01:08:43,932 --> 01:08:45,082
You stay there.

1046
01:08:45,216 --> 01:08:45,814
Stay there.

1047
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:46,970
It's a good sweet spot.

1048
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,060
Yeah, absolutely.

1049
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:50,390
Poor Alex.

1050
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:51,060
Yeah.

1051
01:08:54,010 --> 01:09:03,340
There's a lot of folks who defend Alex, and one of the things that they say I think you would agree with, and that is that he tells it like it is.

1052
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,270
I tell it like it is.

1053
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,834
I don't pull my punches.

1054
01:09:06,882 --> 01:09:07,770
I fight evil.

1055
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:10,720
I expose the new world order.

1056
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:12,638
Evidence is now coming out.

1057
01:09:12,664 --> 01:09:16,542
The bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia, was the work of the globalist.

1058
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:19,142
They were pulling their people out hours before it took place.

1059
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:22,434
From the very hotel itself, not other hotels.

1060
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:26,958
They had threatened the government to submit to total Global Control or Terrace Wood strike.

1061
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,350
Yes.

1062
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,386
No one who says I tell it like it is ever.

1063
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:41,466
Actually, one does or two has anything good to say.

1064
01:09:41,528 --> 01:09:45,814
What about people who calls them like they see them? Well, that's delicious.

1065
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:48,538
As long as you add the plural.

1066
01:09:48,574 --> 01:09:50,430
Yeah, it calls them like I sees them.

1067
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,366
That's good stuff.

1068
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:52,554
Okay, so that one is all right.

1069
01:09:52,592 --> 01:09:54,994
That's a little bit that has reverence.

1070
01:09:55,042 --> 01:10:01,434
What about a straight shooter? Straight shooter? No, it's something that other people describe you as.

1071
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:03,630
That makes me think that you are a liar.

1072
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:10,710
Alex takes more calls here and he gets a call from a guy who I think doesn't believe in laws.

1073
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:12,930
I appreciate this, man.

1074
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:21,978
It's kind of difficult to tell exactly where he's coming from, but he believes, I think, maybe in a God's law kind of situation.

1075
01:10:22,064 --> 01:10:26,818
Trying to get that self evident law? Yeah, natural law, perhaps.

1076
01:10:26,914 --> 01:10:34,050
He's not specific enough for me to really nail down, but he does believe that just because laws are signed into law, that doesn't mean they're laws.

1077
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,762
So he's not in the jurisdiction.

1078
01:10:37,846 --> 01:10:40,340
He's more of the law of the jungle kind of guy.

1079
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:45,178
Based on his voice, I don't think he lies in the jungle.

1080
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:48,202
Yeah, well, that's probably true, but maybe spiritually.

1081
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:48,642
Okay.

1082
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:50,910
Anyway, he has a request for Alex.

1083
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,514
I keep running all over you, but I've had you on a couple of segments.

1084
01:10:54,622 --> 01:11:02,010
Anything else you wanted to add from New Mexico? I just want to know if I can get a time to call you for a few minutes off the air.

1085
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:06,020
I got some things to hash over to kind of take some thought.

1086
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:12,200
Unfortunately, from the time I leave here until about midnight tonight, I'm going to be working.

1087
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:15,330
But good excuse.

1088
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,114
I don't know when I can talk to you, sir.

1089
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,660
I mean, I'm not trying to spam a big shot or anything.

1090
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,330
I'm in deep trouble.

1091
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:30,954
I have hundreds of phone calls, hundreds of emails, faxes with folks that want to talk to me, and let's talk about it here on the air.

1092
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:31,374
Go ahead.

1093
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,170
What's going on? Look, dude, I'm behind the eight ball.

1094
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:37,506
I like it when trying to let them down easy.

1095
01:11:37,568 --> 01:11:38,634
Gets way out of hand.

1096
01:11:38,672 --> 01:11:39,870
I'm in big trouble.

1097
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:44,454
To the point where he's like, listen, I'm on the run from the cops right now.

1098
01:11:44,492 --> 01:11:46,998
I can't be taking phone calls at any point in time.

1099
01:11:47,084 --> 01:11:48,630
I shouldn't even be doing a radio show.

1100
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,470
Honestly.

1101
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,254
Listen, I had to get rid of my phone.

1102
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:53,398
I've got burner phones.

1103
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,914
I throw them into the ocean after I use them.

1104
01:11:55,952 --> 01:12:02,180
One time I'm in a bunker that is sealed with lead and they'll never find me.

1105
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,282
Listen, I'm behind the a ball.

1106
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,270
I'm working for the next 6 hours.

1107
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,290
I'm being chased by the cops.

1108
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:12,894
I've got to take my daughter fishing at some point so I can't call you.

1109
01:12:12,932 --> 01:12:19,794
It seems really obvious the way you could just handle this and that is that it is unsafe for me to talk to you off the air.

1110
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:20,214
Yeah.

1111
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:22,458
I don't know what you're up to.

1112
01:12:22,544 --> 01:12:25,160
There's a lot of ways that this could expose me.

1113
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:38,574
If you're Alex, this is the simplest thing in the world, but you don't want to give that message because it's too likely to make the audience think that you think that they're crazy or something.

1114
01:12:38,732 --> 01:12:42,150
Whereas Alex is a big public figure.

1115
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:49,926
There is a very acceptable boundary to be like, I'm not talking to you off air.

1116
01:12:50,048 --> 01:12:51,500
We don't know each other.

1117
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:56,720
You can send an email or something, but we're not going to do that.

1118
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:10,722
When you actively court people who blur the line between reality and fiction, it's going to be a little bit more of a tighter walk to let them down easy on account of you don't know what part of the fiction that's going to add you into.

1119
01:13:10,796 --> 01:13:11,660
That's true.

1120
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:18,020
You see that through a lot of interactions that Alex has with his fans over the course of time.

1121
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:24,270
There is an unwillingness to be honest about what the boundary is because of that.

1122
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,506
I know who you are.

1123
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:26,180
Right.

1124
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:27,486
I know.

1125
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:30,406
And we just need to keep this separate.

1126
01:13:30,598 --> 01:13:34,340
The only thing I know about you is you believe what I say.

1127
01:13:34,730 --> 01:13:36,582
You like me and that's bad.

1128
01:13:36,656 --> 01:13:37,280
Yeah.

1129
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,378
The Groucho Marx's thing.

1130
01:13:39,404 --> 01:13:41,590
I don't want to be a member of any club that would have me as a member.

1131
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,758
Surely that's used to describe low self esteem.

1132
01:13:44,794 --> 01:13:44,994
Right.

1133
01:13:45,032 --> 01:13:47,634
But with Alex completely different.

1134
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:52,146
I made this club and I don't ever want to visit this club close.

1135
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,822
I lock the door with them inside it.

1136
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:58,678
I don't want to be around anybody who would be a member of my club.

1137
01:13:58,774 --> 01:14:03,846
Listen, I own the Double Deuce and I'm not stepping foot in that fucking place.

1138
01:14:03,908 --> 01:14:04,422
No.

1139
01:14:04,556 --> 01:14:09,210
So anyway, this caller here's what he wants to discuss with Alex offair.

1140
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:10,854
Let's talk about it here on the air.

1141
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:11,274
Go ahead.

1142
01:14:11,312 --> 01:14:22,074
What's going on? Well, it concerns the interpretation of the Bible and we are not supposed to fear any has to expose the devil and he will flee from you.

1143
01:14:22,172 --> 01:14:22,806
Oh boy.

1144
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:24,500
And it's a long story.

1145
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:32,360
The pieces of this puzzle are scattered from one end of the Bible to the other and put them all together in right order.

1146
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:42,030
They're going to take some serious thought because Christ said that the scribes will pervert the scriptures.

1147
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:48,150
And there are some places that take Bill research to figure out what was changed.

1148
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:54,260
This is not a total holy word of God, it is the perverted word of God.

1149
01:14:55,070 --> 01:15:03,726
And I think it would take a half an hour if you don't what I mean, probably longer than that.

1150
01:15:03,788 --> 01:15:08,540
Sir, you have just explained why I do not want to talk to you up there.

1151
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:14,502
Sir, people have been studying the Bible for quite a while now.

1152
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,640
You didn't you have cracked the code.

1153
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:18,570
You cracked the code.

1154
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,700
You're telling me.

1155
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:26,658
And it'll take you half an hour to explain it to me? Yeah, that's I'm sure you're going to stop in a half hour.

1156
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:30,560
I'm going to start the watch and that you don't get on with things.

1157
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:47,194
So you have one last clip here and I know that another thing that was making the rounds on social media was recently was a clip of Alex saying that there was going to be false flag globalist terror attacks before the midterms.

1158
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:56,660
This is another clip Ron Flipkowski decided to post without context, relevant context that Alex says that all the fucking time, pretty much every day.

1159
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:04,062
It is not worthwhile or meaningful to post at all to make people think this is like, oh, look at him, look at him.

1160
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:06,754
He's making a desperate, weird prediction.

1161
01:16:06,802 --> 01:16:10,794
No, this is what he does every day and has since 2003.

1162
01:16:10,952 --> 01:16:12,738
I've already read Patriot Act too.

1163
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:19,160
It allows them to secretly grab you, blow your head off for any misdemeanor and get business records without a court order.

1164
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:24,690
And Ashcroft is going to go on a ten states tour to promote this.

1165
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:28,026
Well, I know he's already promoting it, I'm sorry, 20 state.

1166
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:29,374
20 state tour.

1167
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:33,246
But you're telling me that he's recording a special oh, man.

1168
01:16:33,368 --> 01:16:35,034
Recorded in today's New York Daily News.

1169
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:36,930
If you want, you can get the Daily News online.

1170
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,822
Well, the fact that they're introducing this now tells me they're getting ready to do some boom booming.

1171
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,930
Oh, yeah, they're going to do some boom booming.

1172
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:47,038
I mean, let's see, we've had explosions before the midterm.

1173
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:50,446
We've had nukes before presidential election.

1174
01:16:50,518 --> 01:17:02,670
Sure we've had they were going ramp up helicopter intoauguration yes, obviously the polonium poisoning was rampant for a while.

1175
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:07,362
There were two incidents to the same person that also didn't happen.

1176
01:17:07,436 --> 01:17:07,998
Right.

1177
01:17:08,144 --> 01:17:09,620
But yes, there was that.

1178
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,226
It's constant.

1179
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:24,426
It's a hallmark and feature of his career and anybody who doesn't understand that, it's window dressing it's again, just like we were laughing and joking about this before.

1180
01:17:24,488 --> 01:17:29,466
It's just like if you ask Alex, is there a reason to be scared about something, absolutely, yes.

1181
01:17:29,648 --> 01:17:42,682
And one of the things he always uses to scare people is that specter of the coming false flag attack that is justified by some piece of his narrative.

1182
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:47,746
There is obviously Democrats are scared that they are going to lose the midterms.

1183
01:17:47,818 --> 01:17:51,922
And so they must do bombings in order to make sure they win the midterms.

1184
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:52,640
Right.

1185
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:59,190
Ashcroft wants to get Patriot Act Two in, but there's opposition to it from the Patriots.

1186
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,280
He's better do some boom booming in order to make sure that this goes through.

1187
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:06,234
It's always this.

1188
01:18:06,272 --> 01:18:09,260
And I don't understand how it's been 20 years.

1189
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,506
I know.

1190
01:18:10,688 --> 01:18:12,870
And it's still an effective thing.

1191
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:18,546
It's still something that people can it's because people dip in and out.

1192
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:20,122
It's because people like Ron Philip.

1193
01:18:20,146 --> 01:18:20,554
Owki.

1194
01:18:20,602 --> 01:18:22,110
Get to dip in and out.

1195
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:31,414
A fucking youth baseball coach turned by the media into some fucking alt right hero for just being a fucking idiot.

1196
01:18:31,522 --> 01:18:32,754
I hate him so much.

1197
01:18:32,852 --> 01:18:44,142
But it is that, like, oh, if you dip in every three or four months, then you have in your head this idea, well, he can't do this every day.

1198
01:18:44,276 --> 01:18:48,570
Because you assume that because there's no way he could do this every day.

1199
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:48,798
Right.

1200
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:56,910
I mean, even if you have an awareness of who Alex is and you don't pay much attention, jon Ronson even was like, does he repeat things? Absolutely.

1201
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:57,680
Yeah.

1202
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:03,570
There is a awareness of what Alex does that you only really get by watching a bunch of it.

1203
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:12,942
And unfortunately, I don't think that most people should do that because it's obviously well, I mean, the problem is our own assumptions based on how everything else works.

1204
01:19:13,136 --> 01:19:17,742
It is to us unsustainable to do the same thing every day.

1205
01:19:17,816 --> 01:19:26,322
Will you imagine how bored you would get if a show that you watched the same thing, you see a clip every few months and you go, wow, this must be an unusual thing.

1206
01:19:26,396 --> 01:19:28,290
It wouldn't be newsworthy.

1207
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:30,186
Yeah, he's on one.

1208
01:19:30,248 --> 01:19:32,382
It wouldn't be newsworthy if it's every day.

1209
01:19:32,456 --> 01:19:35,694
But it's newsworthy because it's manufactured for you.

1210
01:19:35,852 --> 01:19:37,194
It's created for you.

1211
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:41,190
I think there's that the dipping in and out for sure is a piece of it.

1212
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:48,138
And then I also think that one of the reasons that it stays effective is there is just pain in the world.

1213
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:51,870
Like negative traumatic events do happen.

1214
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:52,470
Sure.

1215
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:57,054
And those are things that Alex will then attach these ideas too.

1216
01:19:57,212 --> 01:20:10,714
And I guess people will just experience that as being the confirmation, and they'll forget about all the countless times that he's been making up vague warnings about boom booming.

1217
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:11,190
Yeah.

1218
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:19,350
I mean, the thing that's most suspicious is in 20 years, the globalists would have to have taken a break for a bit, at least.

1219
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:19,854
No way.

1220
01:20:19,892 --> 01:20:22,460
But they have never stopped, not once.

1221
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:26,970
Despite the fact that they celebrate a million holidays every year.

1222
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,702
It is always a work holiday.

1223
01:20:28,786 --> 01:20:30,478
They never even take a vacation.

1224
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:32,310
Well, they're like Alex that way.

1225
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,406
Except even that he's not working, ever.

1226
01:20:35,468 --> 01:20:39,570
No, but that just gave me an idea for a movie pitch.

1227
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,890
Globalist vacation.

1228
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:45,286
They finally take a vacation.

1229
01:20:45,478 --> 01:20:46,894
Now we have two movie pitches.

1230
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:47,886
Okay, that's one.

1231
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:48,906
That's the first 1.

1232
01:20:48,968 --> 01:20:49,974
Second one.

1233
01:20:50,132 --> 01:20:52,354
The globalists are on vacation.

1234
01:20:52,462 --> 01:20:52,842
Sure.

1235
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:54,910
But they still need to be false flags.

1236
01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:55,390
Naturally.

1237
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,522
So they bring in the junior varsity globalist hemps.

1238
01:20:58,606 --> 01:21:00,500
Right? Absolutely.

1239
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,758
Somebody gets promoted.

1240
01:21:02,794 --> 01:21:03,874
This is their big shot.

1241
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:04,134
Right.

1242
01:21:04,172 --> 01:21:06,860
But it turns out this is an eager young person.

1243
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:14,398
If they were younger or we had made this movie, like, 15 years ago, this would be a vince Vaughn, owen Wilson.

1244
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:15,114
Absolutely.

1245
01:21:15,272 --> 01:21:19,350
They're the guys who come in and they ragtag band of misfits.

1246
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,298
Vacations? No.

1247
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:32,218
The global intern.

1248
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:32,878
Yeah.

1249
01:21:33,024 --> 01:21:39,182
What would we call them? I mean, you got to call them something like the Nation Squad.

1250
01:21:39,326 --> 01:21:40,646
They're not global.

1251
01:21:40,838 --> 01:21:41,830
It sucks.

1252
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,700
We'll work on this.

1253
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:46,718
Yeah.

1254
01:21:46,864 --> 01:21:49,478
We'll workshop this and have it back for you in about six months.

1255
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:50,740
We'll get a treatment going.

1256
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:58,482
So I'm glad to have gone back to the past because at least there is something concrete going on to be discussed.

1257
01:21:58,506 --> 01:22:01,866
Yes, that is refreshing.

1258
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:04,178
I appreciate the past a great deal.

1259
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:16,638
And so we'll check back in on the present day, keep people posted on dumb Bullshit, the Terror of the midterms midterms.

1260
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:18,446
But until then, Jordan, we have a website.

1261
01:22:18,508 --> 01:22:19,250
We do have a website.

1262
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,330
It's knowledgefight.com.

1263
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:20,810
Yeah.

1264
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,158
We're also on Twitter.

1265
01:22:22,194 --> 01:22:22,902
We are on Twitter.

1266
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:24,566
It's a knowledge underscore fight.

1267
01:22:24,748 --> 01:22:25,478
We will be back.

1268
01:22:25,504 --> 01:22:26,658
But until then, I'm Leo.

1269
01:22:26,694 --> 01:22:27,198
I'm Leo.

1270
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,410
I'm dzx Clark.

1271
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,306
I'm Gerald Snippets.

1272
01:22:30,438 --> 01:22:31,120
No.

1273
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:34,354
Gerald.

1274
01:22:34,402 --> 01:22:34,578
Yeah.

1275
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:37,650
I was wondering where Gerald? That's Wilford's cousin.

1276
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:41,398
I am Wilford Snipplesnabble of The Gribble Pivot.

1277
01:22:41,494 --> 01:22:43,774
And now here comes the sex robots.

1278
01:22:43,882 --> 01:22:45,318
Andy and Chamberlain, you're on the air.

1279
01:22:45,344 --> 01:22:46,290
Thanks for holding.

1280
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,514
So alex.

1281
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:49,434
I'm a first time color.

1282
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,254
I'm a huge fan.

1283
01:22:50,302 --> 01:22:51,090
I love your work.

1284
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:51,430
I loved.
