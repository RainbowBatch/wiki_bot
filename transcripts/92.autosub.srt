They probably

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,088
Anyway

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
We are going to be going over a lot of stuff today we're going to have a number of days

18
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
We're going to be covering today because we were off for a little bit

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
Issues but first-year is an out-of-context drop from Alex Jones

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Oh boy

Larry Nichols

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Us had a conversation

29
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
About 40 minutes

30
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:05,440
I want to just do a little bit of a post-mortem on that now that we're back

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Together here sitting down

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
All the peeps of been able to listen to it

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
And just not super Plaza

00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Address that in the

35
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Gametime but

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Listen

37
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
Like we could do an entire episode breaking down or why the FEMA provisional government isn't real

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
It's not real but that's all we do

39
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,576
We just save that have a good night before I feel like we covered

40
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
The FEMA provisional

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
I've done a bunch of looking into it all it is is just

42
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
The same continuity-of-government

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Fears that Alex hatch

44
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
And most of it is based on the fact that FEMA was created by executive orders

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Rover belong

46
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
President

47
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Yeah I never actually formalized

48
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Into an actual government organization

49
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Until fairly recent

50
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
This is executive control and

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
It's not real

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
And it's only popping up now because

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Lovely remix

54
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Call Larry Nichols bring backup

55
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
If you Google it it's all it all goes back

56
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
Wow this is all just him

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,816
He was he was peddling s*** like this in the nineties yeah

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,472
Are we boring actually being run

59
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,336
Like Iwo Jima provisional government

60
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
Behind the wheel

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,272
In terms of like what we've gone through mind-bogglingly stupid 9/11 happened

62
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,672
The plans had to be kicked in

63
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:46,560
No but members of the government had to go to Safeway locations and stuff like that to the continuity

64
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
Bush did 9/11

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,448
It happens whenever they're disasters that's just that's just a

66
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
The piece of

67
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
It's it's

68
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,384
Let's all that nonsense paranoid fear and it mostly comes out of like weird

69
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
Militia type

70
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
Turns out I think Larry is

71
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
And that's it

72
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Cadre

73
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Either that or he's exploiting that Cadre of idiots

74
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Involved

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256

00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
I want to tell everybody who's listening live

84
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Appreciate it and that everyone is listening later

85
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
I want

00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:57,983
Abundantly clear my job and at the end of the month I will not have a job

00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
And I want to do this

88
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567

And in order to do that I need your help

91
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
And generally we put some sort of a lackadaisical plug at the end of the show

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
What is become a policy wonk

93
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
I want to be much more clear

And we really could use your help in order to make

107
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
This real

108
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,311
I make this work in the way that I wanted to as a

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
A radio show as a much more in-depth

110
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687

Asking for permission to marry his daughter

To survive

133
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
If I get a job

134
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
It's going to cut in today

135
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,943
It's weird it's weird

136
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
You're not going to be a mess or job where I can't listen to Alex Jones

137
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,279
As well and I got a new room

138
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
Stand up

139
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,239
3 times as much as I was before

140
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
If you could avoid the gig economy and axle

141
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Just do something like

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
How do you how do we avoid calling this valuable cuz I don't I will I will I will validate

143
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
I feel like it is broken out in the

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
And my cat

145
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Some good

146
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
I'm doing I'm getting killed a lot

147
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,687
Is the winner of all across the board

148
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
You don't want to call this import

149
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
I'm going to make the argument that what we're doing is important

150
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Play clips

151
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Demonstrative

152
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Very difficult problem

153
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
That we have a thread on that I don't think most people are paying

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
This first clip comes from Sunday

155
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
September at October 8th

156
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
And I heard of this clip

157
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
And I forgot

158
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
And I'm glad I did

159
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Because it comes in much more relevant now

160
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
This is from a conversation

161
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
With Rodger Stone

162
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
On the Sunday show

163
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
It's clear that Alex is drunk

164
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Dear David

165
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,047
Body Rogers somebody somebody

166
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,679
Do you not see the trailer

167
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,199
When we simply try to express

168
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
Dinner with our fellow revolutionaries

169
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,815
The Weeknd

170
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Americana dauntless

171
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
So

172
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
That's a drunk man

173
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
There's a couple things

174
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Enough

175
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,663
No but it is a very specific boat from Star Trek Voyager or a spaceship

176
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,783
Star Trek Voyager

177
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,415
That was designed to look like a voyager ship

178
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,815
People who came aboard what looks like a human ship

179
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
It's also

180
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,567
It's also a generic name for like a pleasure but that's not the important point

181
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
Is Rodger stone is straight-up saying In that clip

182
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
South to meet up with

183
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
The Arkham Patriot

184
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Our fellow revolutionary Milo

185
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Now why this interview happened

186
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
Long after that BuzzFeed article came out

187
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Wherein we learn

188
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,791
Fitone of Milo's primary objectives

189
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Was to whitewash and make more palatable

190
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
White supremacist

191
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
And neo-nazis

192
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Talking point

193
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Into mainstream discourse

194
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,055
We found out that one of his email passwords with kristallnacht

195
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Another one was night of the Long Knives

196
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
There is undeniable that you have leaning towards

197
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Leaning towards neo-Nazi

198
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
Absolutely alright alright means.

199
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
We're done we're done with alt-lite

200
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,303
The fact that all of this has come out and Rodger stone is still calling him a fellow revolutionaries

201
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
And they're working together

202
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Meme

203
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
He doesn't give a s***

204
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Come on

205
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,799
What is what is Rodger Stone but Milo as you know 40 years later

206
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
What time was the

207
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Do you work with Nixon

208
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
You clearly had

209
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,695
What

210
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
The argument that I'm trying

211
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
To make that I'm trying to come to here is that

212
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
We have a group of dudes

213
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,983
Who are clearly working on a operation

214
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
They're working on an operation

215
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
That is

216
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
White supremacist

217
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Neo-Nazi in nature

218
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Is it like

219
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
Pride of lions

220
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Is that what we're going to call the Nazis

221
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Yeah yeah

222
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,559
But here's the here's the other clip that is from the October

223
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
16th show

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Home

225
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Why they're doing

226
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
And it's the way they present it

227
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
And it's not

228
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Not good

229
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Politician

230
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,047
So they present this as a global populist uprising

231
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
That's happening

232
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
When in reality is not what happen

233
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
That is not what's happening in the world

234
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
They are on

235
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
Besides it's fighting against

236
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
Vun

237
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
That would be

238
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,271
If you said those things 50 years ago they be taking their proper

239
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
I mean

240
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
There is a global populist Uprising it's just being

241
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
Co-opted by the people that they are supposed to be uprising

242
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Like if true or using

243
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,215
But like all they're really doing is using the Nazi white supremacy ideology

244
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
As a way to shoehorn in people towards

245
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Giving billionaires

246
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,127
Like all is all

247
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Berkeley manipulate

248
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Milo is owned by the Mercer

249
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
Indebted to all of these billionaires

250
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
People's Banner

251
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
About how the body politic

252
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
People who've been bought by the same billionaires

253
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,191
Like it's a controlled opposition because it's not even that it's just

254
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Mind control

255
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
And now take another step back

256
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
So we have

257
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,663
Rodger stone is clearly still in League with Milo still in League with

258
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
This

259
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
World it's only

260
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
Daily Stormer

261
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
Only this far away from outright

262
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
5 knots

263
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Then we have Larry nickel

264
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
Who is so gracious enough to have a long conversation

265
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
She brought up

266
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Troopergate

267
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,703
Yeah in the conversation that we had and if you think about troopergate

268
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
What was going on was Larry was convincing these

269
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Troopers

270
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
And paying them

271
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
To tell fake stories

272
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
About let's say Vince Foster s***

273
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
All sorts of salacious

274
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Just up against

275
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
The clintons yeah you know who was funding

276
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
It came out that it was a guy named Peter W Smith

277
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:56,255
Who are the Chicago breaker killed himself

278
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
Last year at the age of 81

279
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,703
One week after talking to the Wall Street Journal about how he was working with Russian hackers

280
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
To try and find Hillary Clinton's emails

281
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
On the request of Mike Flynn I don't know

282
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
This f****** stuff

283
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
It's such a mess

284
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Such a mess

285
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
I weld

286
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,647
Do you know what's crazy

287
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
People are so like

288
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
I don't I don't want to get

289
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Log into like a

290
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
Like this is a conspiracy me all this stuff

291
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
TV named after

292
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Look at all these other

293
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
Public

294
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Look it's very clear what they're doing

295
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
The only question is always

296
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Who is conspiring with who

297
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
With who

298
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,303
Do they even know what it is

299
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Is that there actually were

300
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
To have some awareness

301
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Acting well within the Mercers

302
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
You f****** stupid not

303
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
To know that

304
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,663
Of course probably has the idea that there bankroll

305
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Yeah as opposed to

306
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Utilizing him as a propaganda tool to get their gate right your ego probably doesn't let you take Xanax

307
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Exactly

308
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
So all of these guys are

309
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
Inspiring imagine

310
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
Or at least

311
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
I don't know convincing themselves that it's towards their own games and they have no idea that they are not even playing

312
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
Right like that's what it seems like

313
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
So

314
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
I agree

315
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
The point

316
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
That that folds into

317
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Is that all of this is going on

318
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
And we have a thread on all these f****** a******

319
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
The picture starts to come into focus a little bit

320
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,391
And I think the easiest attackable point and the easiest exposable point

321
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
We could do it very easily

322
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Is Alex Jones the assholes

323
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
These number one Castle keep his mouth shut

324
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
Blazing

325
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
Over and over again if people would just pay attention

326
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,311
Right so now here's the other part of my thing

327
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
If Alex Jones were to go down

328
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
If you were to disappear

329
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
I'm a hundred percent convinced

330
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
It would leave a massive hole

331
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
And here's how I know that

332
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Okay

333
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
David Knight is boring as s***

334
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Agree

335
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,463
He gave him 3 hours

336
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
On his Network

337
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Wonderful

338
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
The other person

339
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
When he gave three hours on his Network

340
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Is Owen Shroyer

341
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Hilarious

342
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
The the War Room

343
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
After Alex Jones Show

344
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
I'm still going to call that's fine

345
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,567
On the 20 on the 16th

346
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
On October 16th

347
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Alex leave the show early

348
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
And Owen Shroyer takes over

349
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
And I have some

350
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Clips

351
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
Demonstrate

352
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Shroyer

353
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Can't hang

354
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
He can't do it

355
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
We if we're able to

356
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Like expose Alex

357
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
I know we're capable of

358
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
What are you left with

359
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Boring-ass David Knight

360
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,167
He's over getting inflamed the neo-nazis to action

361
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
Absolutely not

362
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,175
Specifically

363
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
From the 60s

364
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Owen Shroyer

365
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Justin. Doing the job

366
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Here in this first clip we used to be

367
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
One of Alex Jones has big tricks

368
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
Is he gets people really excited screaming out to break

369
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Owen Shroyer can't do it right

370
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,655
Daniel de Jesus

371
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,007
During a violent crime in connection with the death of an eighteen-year-old Diana Martinez Gonzalez

372
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,223
Murder victim that he probably would have

373
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
And yes

374
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,391
This individual was protected from deportation because of the DACA program

375
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,871
Man is that bad that's not like I get it

376
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,991
I don't know if the sound mixing was bad or whatever

377
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
You can't do it he doesn't have that like Alex will be going every second until the cutoff

378
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:44,255
They just can't you can't do it

379
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
There's a murderer

380
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
Terrible zen12 scream about and complain about the

381
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
PC culture run amok

382
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,103
How can I watch Warrior can't do that either listen to how he f**** this up

383
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
This is from the college fix

384
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
Halloween universities Nationwide tell students not

385
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
Tell students What Not to Wear

386
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,671
So Alex has been telling you about this extreme now

387
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
We are a culture

388
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
Not a costume

389
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Who are these people

390
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,447
Who are these people that are so indoctrinated into identity politics

391
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
They can't even

392
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
Enjoy Halloween

393
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,103
It's insensitive it's insane

394
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,199
You can't wear on Halloween

395
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Blackface

396
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Identity politics

397
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
They don't even love algae

398
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
Adreno over Gavin McInnes

399
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
Bushwacker

400
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,495
I get it you're not supposed to say the party

401
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,055
I'm a culture not a costume

402
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Because that makes too much

403
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,687
Does article you're not supposed to save a thing

404
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
That most people thinking we are

405
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,599
Definitely not supposed to do this

406
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
Because of cultural appropriation

407
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
Unacceptable costumes

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,304
Native American headdress

409
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,376
Dressing up as Mexican by wearing a sombrero

410
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
Dressing as a geisha or any form of blackface

411
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,800
I don't know about blackface

412
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:39,200
A Native Americans Indians and Mexicans

413
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
I remember

414
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
And it was

415
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Offended

416
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Right

417
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
I imagine

418
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,032
I don't know what kind of people Owen Shroyer hangs around

419
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
I'm guessing none of them are first

420
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
I'm going to guess not I'm going to guess

421
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
White was telling this story

422
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
What else would be doing it as opposed to putting himself in the hopper

423
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
I'm the guy who dress up like bear claw

424
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,032
And they said you know I don't even understand why it is that people aren't allowed

425
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
All the sudden there are imaginary people on his

426
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:44,736
Another

427
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,624
Hippie Halloween story all over again even when he was trying to be like

428
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Ridiculing and his tone of voice when he's reading the list right he can't pull it off so just like you can't dress like a native

429
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
American you can't just like he looks like

430
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
Yeah

431
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,104
Him on how to be a better shity propagandist

432
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,688
Well I'm just saying

433
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,832
The other thing too is like if you're going to be like I have a contest

434
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,208
Costco hours

435
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
Q-tip everyone called me back

436
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Tim McGraw

437
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
Call

438
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,128
Casablanca line

439
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,456
New new pitch

440
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
No instead

441
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,600
We get hired by Infowars goddamn train his

442
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,440
To get into shape seriously Alex Jones

443
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
People better than this is not a bad plan

444
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Infowars

445
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
You don't make sense what you do but apparently work

446
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,504
Last clip of Owen Shroyer officially free-agent mercenaries will train any

447
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,904
Propaganda

448
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,304
You could ever have

449
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
This is him

450
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,288
He's trying to talk about

451
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
The situation with Colin Kaepernick

452
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
But it's terrible

453
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,784
Colin Kaepernick support is dwindling

454
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,344
NFL ratings are dwindling

455
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,392
NFL attendance is dwindling

456
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,232
And it all started

457
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Yeah okay you can say was yes please

458
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
But

459
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Become the story

460
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
You're kneeling during the national anthem that's never going to win

461
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Alex

462
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
Would never

463
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
Optics become of the story

464
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
Because you know what that means

465
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,784
We lie

466
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Know what the real story is

467
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
Parents

468
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,464
In order to make racist

469
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Angry

470
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Clearly he's just

471
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
He's just telling the truth man

472
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
He has no idea that he's giving up

473
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
About police brutality

474
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
We making our point for us

475
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,160
To that was

476
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
Was like

477
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
I know you're right

478
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,792
He started all this and now he doesn't have a job

479
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
So

480
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
What is collusion

481
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,424
Obviously it seems like it's indicative

482
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,032
To you just clearly made the point that if yes it was about cops killing black

483
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,384
People you know it damn well

484
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Buttocks

485
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,504
Kaepernick advice

486
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
We're charges for Alex Jones

487
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:38,720
Kaepernick advice on how to do it right like Colin call the baby

488
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:44,608
The right light bright

489
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
Become the story is kind of like

490
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
Kind of

491
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Anyway

492
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
Which means we can lie about whatever it is you're looking

493
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,992
I think we've made our point

494
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,784
There's no way

495
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
There's no one competent to take over

496
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
What's that

497
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
KIPP can't hang

498
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,512
There's no adults there other than him come out from behind the camera and host

499
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912
Who's going to do it seems as though Alex is the only one who like they all are probably believe

500
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,472
Libras like

501
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
What

502
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
Is that they're all actual belief

503
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
No

504
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
No no

505
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
You don't think so f****** think someone has said anything

506
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,184
This is why I'm going to go the opposite direction

507
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,000
Exact

508
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Because he thinks

509
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
This is a new show

510
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,728
I don't think so I think he thinks

511
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,752
This is a new show

512
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Alex Jones is the only one

513
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,200
The program understand

514
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,480
Listen to his f****** voice

515
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
How

516
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
Seldom people stick around

517
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Of all the people

518
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
They're not around

519
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,720
In terms of

520
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
Ashley Beckford

521
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
She's gone

522
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
Never meet your

523
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Jakari Jackson

524
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:27,520
The only people who stuck around to Rob do David night Owen Shroyer hasn't even been there that long right

525
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,080
Videos

526
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
Mimi's

527
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Maybe Alex's

528
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
The real problem

529
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Maybe it's hiring practice

530
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
I don't think that this is much

531
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,344
To a lot of people this or 2gig whether it's news or not

532
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,464
Let's get to let's get the bulk of

533
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Today

534
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,536
We're going to be Friday

535
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Friday the 13th

536
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
Watch over episode

537
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Big eyes

538
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,472
Let me say this

539
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
There's a lot of people have a lot of different favorite Alex

540
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Like what's your favorite

541
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
What's your favorite version of Alice

542
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Like what the mood

543
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
But he gets into is your favor

544
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,112
Probably the least an Oculus of all which is the

545
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
Fake angry

546
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
Okay so the very obvious screaming

547
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,168
That is the least harmful baby cuz

548
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,704
At least most of his products

549
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,752
Can actually do anything unless

550
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,336
Use them beyond all to take them everyday

551
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,712
Alex from the chat room

552
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
Of course

553
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,296
A favorite of everyone getting a dead Alex

554
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Survive from my friend Brian

555
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,416
You got but I'm right there with you

556
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
I like Alex

557
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Quite a bit

558
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,584
Like there is a version of Alex that is kind of rare

559
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
That is Alex surprises himself on air

560
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,472
Advanced something happens that like

561
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
He punches himself

562
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,848
Right into another punch that comes from another Direction

563
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
Evan Hughes lost without a map on air

564
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
It has to fill time

565
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
And he is like

566
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Dave

567
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,064
And that always leads to esoterica

568
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,416
That might be your right whenever he just randomly starts getting existential

569
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,024
The Hollies

570
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,120
You got the right Alex riddle teller Alex is my favorite allies

571
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:34,752
Are all day February

572
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Alex

573
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Get

574
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
Stupid esoteric

575
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,896
Okay but there's a narrative to why it happens

576
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
That I think is a

577
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Really interesting path

578
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:47,808
Okay in this first clip

579
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,392
To the beginning of the episode he's not super interest back Tavor super

580
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
He's reserved

581
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Then

582
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,048
He accidentally talks about wine

583
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,376
And he accidentally

584
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
Brings this up

585
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:10,848
Show I've been on a lot of TV shows

586
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Comedy shows

587
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
I can't imagine that

588
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
Hollywood was so one-dimensional

589
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
That must mean you're a liberal

590
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,080
Until they find out your real political views it's just crazier

591
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,528
And instill they like you because you're criticizing Bush they don't don't like bush

592
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
That was

593
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
20 years ago

594
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
15 years ago

595
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
67 years

596
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
So he's

597
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
20

598
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
4

599
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Debbie's 44 now

600
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
To that point and I'll keep that in mind

601
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,688
I don't think anyone's ready

602
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,992
Here but at the same time

603
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
I'm not judging him

604
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
I'm going to enter this the end of this clip

605
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,440
With a lot of empathy in my heart and

606
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
Five Northern California Love Central areas Lubbock

607
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Los Angeles

608
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,080
If Satan lives on the planet that's where you live

609
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
The energy

610
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
Going into meetings with Hollywood producers

611
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,304
People that ball want to put your film outer make a film with you these are big big things

612
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,216
Not as big as Weinstein is he's just ubiquitous that name but

613
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Grocery wise as big

614
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,360
Lawyers for some of the top people

615
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
The owners of

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,504
Capital actors

617
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,392
Hollywood

618
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
Itzy popularity for other people

619
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Okay I play football

620
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
And I never took it as if it was done that

621
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Homosexual way

622
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,272
It was done as domination

623
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
What the hell's going on

624
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
If you just said

625
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
Binoculars

626
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
What I wanted and they would be completely scared

627
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
So

628
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Okay

629
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
He goes on a bit about this

630
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
Back into bravado

631
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
He just revealed that

632
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
We assaulted yeah

633
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
And he gets

634
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
Exactly what that is

635
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
It's not

636
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Yeah

637
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Where I'm sitting

638
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Where I'm sitting

639
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
It's in that in that situation

640
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
That is not something that I would ever come down on him

641
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
M4

642
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,896
But I do not think you meant to bring this out on the air

643
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Necessarily

644
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,504
I don't think he realizes how big

645
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
Like how

646
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
You know that's

647
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
That's better

648
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
Something to bring out into the public Alex

649
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536
You never give me you've joined Terry Crews

650
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Yeah

651
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,912
In the funeral hey it happens to us well kind of

652
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
That blindsided

653
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
But the other thing is

654
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,616
He can't handle the fact that I think that there's a little bit of vulnerability that

655
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
Comes out in that moment

656
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
That was that was honest

657
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
And he

658
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,928
He was telling the truth

659
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:46,304
Eddie talked about it a whole bunch more and I didn't believe in anymore cuz it's not like

660
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,352
Into more details you disorder reiterate

661
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Stop

662
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:56,032
He's ended up having like a little bit of like he gets in a weird mood and he goes to a special report

663
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,104
She throws it to a special report from Mark Dice

664
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
I don't I don't know

665
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,808
Okay we're getting to why I played that song before the show

666
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
This is bananas

667
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
Suggested he knows

668
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
Jessica Mendoza

669
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,816
Exactly what sexual assault really is

670
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
It's really about

671
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
Yes and

672
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Or I guess he has

673
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
To divorce that part

674
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
He's tried

675
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
To kill that part of

676
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,848
Himself so much that he's gone so far the APA

677
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:31,616
Opposite direction

678
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
Exactly

679
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
Feel bad about us like covering this and I still hate him

680
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
But at the same time this is why

681
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,304
The recipient of being broke

682
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
So he goes with Special Report

683
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
Been up to

684
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Add from Mark Dice

685
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Yeah

686
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,080
Left the entire thing in but here is Mark.

687
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Very iffy take

688
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Auntie

689
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Situation

690
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
In Hollywood

691
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Who face homosexual

692
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,480
So there is an issue

693
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
It's not

694
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,392
It's not great to be like it's so much harder for men

695
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
It's not great

696
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,256
It isn't lying with Infowars sort of brand certainly but

697
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
No

698
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
I mean

699
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,704
There's so much

700
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
In those very few sentences

701
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
There's human

702
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,640
History and those three

703
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,968
Is right there

704
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,272
Absolutely

705
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Of course there is

706
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,952
That fear of

707
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
It's at the worst possible thing that could

708
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
Rights of Man being sexually assault

709
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,632
Because how much worse is it that the man who's supposed

710
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
To be dominant rape is

711
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Dominate

712
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,800
How much does a play into Alex's

713
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Kind of

714
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Is it does get better

715
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Idea of like

716
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,248
Abusers have been abused

717
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,064
Abusers because of that abuse

718
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,112
You

719
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,928
You know there's no like short psychological

720
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
Through-line 2nd of

721
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,048
Amount of like

722
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Alex was

723
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
Dominated and he never wants to feel like that at

724
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:10,080
And so you does that to everybody that he can't use victimizer is everywhere.

725
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,920
Someone who wants to kill all of us

726
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Everybody's trying to

727
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:21,088
I don't like 50 describing it

728
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
But when you

729
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,440
When you start to see that abusers have been abused

730
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,720
Through-line

731
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
Hit through so many different areas

732
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
Brave

733
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
Who is

734
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
Like that

735
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
Like he has no idea what

736
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
No use in trying to get click

737
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,872
What it is

738
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,920
He's accidentally revealing about

739
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,688
Himself

740
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Infowars in everybody that they're talking

741
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Yeah yeah yeah

742
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,600
Because even worse has the tacit admission

743
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,672
But this is a horrifying thing that can happen

744
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,024
Minimizing maximizing

745
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Sentiment

746
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,192
Still discussing that this is the thing right

747
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,728
It's not

748
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
This is like you know I don't

749
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
But I don't think it's

750
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,992
Productive for us not to treat Alex Jones like a human you know like I don't think that necessarily like I don't think

751
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
I don't I don't think

752
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
To look at

753
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
Someone that you even to someone you hate

754
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
And take as a huge problem in the world

755
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
To look at them outside of the context

756
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,536
Like I have things happened you live your life

757
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,304
Are you baby

758
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,704
Are are in town

759
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,264
Killer books

760
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
And you see

761
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
Very similar

762
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
Types of story

763
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Emerge over and over and over

764
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Like there's this book called The Road out of hell

765
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Where it's like

766
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
Was a true

767
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Monster this is

768
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
The psychopath who had murdered

769
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,904
People who committed all of these horrible Acts

770
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
But

771
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
If you go back to

772
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
To before

773
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
Here. All that's

774
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
His childhood

775
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
There's no way that you

776
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
You can't feel some empathy

777
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
For that child

778
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,728
While at the same time thinking that that adult

779
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
Should be murdered in the street

780
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,336
You know

781
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
Skip out

782
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Yes please on this right now

783
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
What sets off Alex into the strangest mood possible on this Friday the 13th

784
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
He spends

785
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
Talking about

786
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
Trump

787
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
And how he knows about how Trump dates

788
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,680
In this next clip which is just

789
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
He's delivered

790
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
Between

791
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,295
Not just from Rodger Stone and people become a lot of other folks and

792
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Electronic

793
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
Quartz women

794
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,143
I won't jump in bed with anybody and he's

795
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
That's what no one knows

796
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,079
When it comes to relationships everything

797
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
1

798
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
Woman

799
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
That woman

800
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Yes money

801
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,831
Until they're not

802
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Donald Trump

803
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:48,191
Boss and the guys talking about women and goes yeah it's incredible

804
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,239
Here is the section where you misinterpret

805
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
Billy bush

806
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Something weird

807
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,271
I want to climbing up on you on you

808
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,207
And then it's a ritual

809
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
The wrestler

810
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,511
Alex their hips

811
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,703
Kissing this isn't

812
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,751
Whippoorwills have their songs in

813
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Creatures mate

814
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Different whale species have their stuff it's not that

815
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
A woman jumps on you

816
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,503
Throwing your panties at you

817
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,831
What do you think that means it means we want to make with you

818
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,255
Years ago

819
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
Most men are hypocrites if you

820
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
Haven't been in a locker room

821
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,895
And made comments about your girlfriend or wife and they're not bad ones

822
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
Call about my wife she's not street legal

823
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,111
10000 horsepower car

824
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,415
If you want

825
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,767
Horsepower what are you doing with that out here on the street

826
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,351
Complement

827
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
Okay

828
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:29,055
The sixties in a

829
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Room

830
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,383
Spiraling

831
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,175
Should drop of that locker room

832
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,271
Maybe not as 12 years ago

833
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Let me talk about how my wife is too much

834
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Horsepower

835
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
Ownership

836
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,791
A little

837
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
Like is like

838
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Give you gas and all this stuff and then the moment you push back here

839
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
He's gone right

840
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Like it.

841
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,823
My wife isn't street legal like a car you owe

842
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,271
Yeah there's something I don't says that most men are hypocrites

843
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
Sure I agree with that

844
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
I don't agree with anything else

845
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
Are corrected not street legal

846
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
If true

847
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,543
Interstitial thing we had here

848
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,615
We had this weird Revelation about

849
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
Meeting with Executives at

850
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
The top

851
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
That was the punch that Alex

852
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,295
Himself that knocked him in this direction

853
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Adhere

854
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
Is the punch that I think

855
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Comes to him from the other direction

856
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
He wasn't expecting

857
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Trump had a press conference

858
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
On

859
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
Yes and I think Alex thought it was going to

860
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
To talk tough about North Korea

861
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:00,959
Not have allowed that I've been building

862
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
This is Vanessa

863
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,079
Now Ron Paul thinks I'm a neocon cuz I support Trump

864
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
This is important

865
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
He starts just saying all

866
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
About how evil ouranos

867
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,015
And Alex has this moment

868
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,855
What is something going to war

869
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
So control The Narrative of how this is going to go he is not in real time

870
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,455
Making a justification

871
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
Absolute until Alex is like oh s***

872
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
I think we have in that moment that you hear the

873
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
Like I sound like

874
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
When he goes to break

875
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,743
I'm guessing

876
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
I was like

877
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,375
The propaganda

878
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Neocon

879
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,287
Is that what's going on you wants to attack around clearly

880
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,895
What is going on

881
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:18,271
Follow the rules according to the investigators

882
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,063
It's so Alex

883
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,391
Realizes that he has only a couple options on the table

884
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,671
And that is

885
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
Pretend it didn't happen

886
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
You got to kill another hour-and-a-half of the ship

887
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,799
He can't have Owen Shroyer feelings we see what he does

888
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
So

889
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,247
Trump is definitely lying about the Iran agreement clearly they've been following the rules

890
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
Manipulate

891
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
In this

892
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
We get to where Alex

893
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Just trying to get

894
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
Any kind of a toe-hold

895
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
And it's not really working out

896
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,847
It starts with him sort of making peace with war

897
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
That's not great

898
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:22,271
That's the compromising of a lot of the things he stands for

899
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,135
This is 7 minutes long you can tell me whenever you want me to pause it

900
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
1

901
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,679
It's a miracle we been here this long

902
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
What

903
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
Long Pond

904
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Latta Long Pond

905
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
I just look at

906
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
I know what trumps doing

907
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:57,087
Where we been maneuvered by the whole Hollywood globalist

908
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
Hollywood stars

909
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,463
Token economy and then

910
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,863
Made themselves Richard and God basically but then cut off the economy to make people poor

911
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,215
The terms of their surrender so they can cut Christians

912
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
And people that are so good

913
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Weird stuff

914
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,479
Hollywood into a bathroom with him

915
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,183
Long as you belong. But hey

916
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,487
Follow this societal comportment

917
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279
Destroy your life

918
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
This is about Iran

919
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
Biggest weakness

920
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,959
As decent Christian people we have a moral compass we have

921
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Conscience

922
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,943
Take care of your children and not lying

923
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
You lie all the time

924
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
Replaced it

925
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:05,695
Where do you got to teach 5 year olds

926
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,511
What

927
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,047
That's your new religion

928
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,263
Extremes of Christianity and cults

929
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,567
Using the Christian faith to control people

930
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Churches in Mumbai

931
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,807
And follow it and get it all this self-loathing and

932
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,367
All this guilt

933
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
Okay

934
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
You can pause it right

935
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:42,047
Luckily we have a lot of long pauses in order to I'm worried

936
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,655
I think I agree with 80% of what he saying right now

937
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
And that concerns me

938
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
You might be because I understand exactly how I'm

939
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
Feeling about that speaking so vaguely is like

940
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
He's at he's at that

941
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Like

942

This could be and then come here and then they teach your kids and

Because they don't claim they're good

967
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,135
Little planet already got it all figured out

Robert's Rules of Order on that front but what about

976
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,223

That's why they're so much as they know they can't scare us

996
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,719
I'm already sure separation from God

00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Absolutely

1014
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823

I should worry about myself my family

1017
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
It's not some

1018
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
Or some negligence

1019
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
Parricide

1020
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:31,999
Also

1021
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
I just want to be clear

1022
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
You're not ready for it

1023
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:40,959
Not ready for that you're not ready for the going to break music

1024
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,543
Divorce match

1025
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,687
If he goes into a sales pitch from here is my friend

1026
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,295
But the going to break music

1027
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
Family and I used

00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
Filters for that air filters

1029
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375

1030
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,679
But I'm all and everything

1031
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,775
My family might need my treasure my blood I'm ready it's all in

1032
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
Making that decision

1033
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
Spiritual level

1034
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,199
Is like coming out of Egypt's like coming out of that one

1035
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
Decide

1036
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,271
To be all in

1037
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
Is a minute you start level

1038
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
And then you start knowing

1039
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:39,071
You don't want to commit suicide you don't want to die but you're not afraid anymore and

1040
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,703
Or at least

1041
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,823
He at least has had some dark moments

1042
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
Before Trump

1043
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Oh yeah

1044
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Maybe he works out like so stagnant

1045
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,759
And nice maybe that's what drove him after all

1046
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,063
Maybe was being a lot but you also was it like

1047
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
Just like a depression

What separates

1066
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,247
Is a choice

1067
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551

When the wolf fenrir comes to e2000 Jesus

1129
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:29,951
Coming out of a commercial I was like oh no no no

1130
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
No

1131
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:39,679
Hollywood and all these people

1132
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,519
If you want to know why they fear the dog

1133
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
Social President Trump

1134
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455

01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
Don't know how to defeat them

1136
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319

1137
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,415
That's why

1138
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,559

So real quick

1140
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
Hold on to those thoughts

1141
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,335
About genuine being genuine

1142
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
And then having an inner compass

1143
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Those sorts of things

1144
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
Well in your mind

1145
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991

1172
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Frisbee.

You're smart

1174
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,583
Problem

1175
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,399
And gosh darn it do you have that strength

1176
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Don't like it

1177
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,239
If you don't have the office

1178
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,543
Even if you aren't in the power structure

1179
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,455
You're talking to yourself might call your skinny as of your hearts pointed towards God

1180
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,991
You have the birthright

1181
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Enemy

1182
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
Everfield

1183
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,255
Tammy falling in the enemy says if I could just have control

1184
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,263
Whenever you had discernment

1185
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
You're built to be a

1186
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
Receiver

1187
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,663
Shub Creator God sister

1188
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,271
You're a spark from God you are not God

1189
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,367
You are the space time continuum

1190
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
Of the progeneration

1191
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,863
Incomplete

1192
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
God

1193
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
But the attempt

1194
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
That would come out

1195
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,311
The mouth of the river is the river is a lie

1196
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,199
Like a tree that grew by the side of the river

1197
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
Gold fell over into the river

1198
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,975
Those that choose to be cut off from God achieved Oblivion

1199
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,279
I don't know what that has to do with the river

1200
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,447
I've kept in the last 10 seconds of Silence

1201
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,287
That is such a god

1202
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:32,383
That's our biggest number 14 why none of those fuckfaces

1203
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
Is could ever

1204
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
Cover for Alex

1205
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,711
Because Daddy

1206
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
Your Evangelical pastor

1207
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
That has all of that

1208
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,927
Cadence that Rhythm is a point where if you're not paying attention

1209
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:50,559
Sounds really comforted if you're not paying enough attention it sounds like you miss

1210
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,703
Something stupid s*** that you're like

1211
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,543
I guess he knows what he's talking about the parable

1212
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,943
It's not a river in Utah

1213
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,807
Calboy

1214
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
I've been to so many churches

1215
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,767
That have that guy

1216
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:27,167
Until you actually listen and then you're like oh no this is all dumb and ran into a crazy

1217
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
You did the thing and then

1218
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:39,199
Freddy jumps into clip from the day before show about

1219
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,599
Hello is Project Veritas a town

1220
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:54,047
That's how he kicks out of this downward spiral

1221
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,095
The show is whatever it is

1222
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:02,495
Takes over the fourth hour but I wanted to go on with that

1223
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
We had a conversation

1224
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,823
If he says

1225
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,663
Let the wolf die choking on my flash

1226
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
I'm not going to

1227
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,575
Big fan of that thing I like

1228
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
If I were Buckley

1229
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,671
I would have a button

1230
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:27,327
If someone would tackle

1231
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,143
We talked about that

1232
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,727
Buckley has the balls

1233
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
To come up to Alex and be like hey

1234
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,359
Maybe not so much with the wolf

1235
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,647
Journey through Alex Jones

1236
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,975
Wherein he makes an accidental confession

1237
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Something that we all

1238
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Should feel sympathetic

1239
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
About

1240
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607

Learn

1242
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
The guy you've been

1243
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,263
Stumping for is probably more militaristic than he's been pretending

1244
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Is an insect

1245
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,615
Psychopath who doesn't believe anything

1246
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,663
Despite the fact that he is an intake

1247
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,479
Psychopaths actually does believe things in

1248
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,319
He's coming up against the idea

1249
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:27,743
Like if we if we think about it like

1250
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,047
Steve pieczenik is just falling out of Grey

1251
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
Right he also lost Robert David Steele as a as a source for something within the last couple

1252
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,263
Losing a lot of these.

1253
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,151
Answered right after that

1254
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
He's finally coming to grips

1255
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
What's with the Lost

1256
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
Could be

1257
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,599
In the context of all the other tragedy plus time equals that

1258
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Burnout

1259
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,887
So there's probably a

1260
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
A bit of like Alex

1261
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,007
I mean if he's it's never going to become going to get more than they

1262
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,543
I don't think but he's struggling

1263
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
Hey Miss episode Italy

1264
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
Friday the 13th full moon

1265
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:20,735
He's struggling super hard with the dissolution of

1266
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,831
It's probably cathartic

1267
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,695
For him to just ramble and say nonsense on air

1268
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,743
You can never really be on television Alex

1269
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:32,767
That

1270
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,863
You wonder why people use

1271
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,143
If he was on Taylor

1272
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Someone would say

1273
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,079
I have that book

1274
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,383
Cuz then Infowars would just be Alex Jones

1275
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,455
Whoever Buckley said that I'm not against it

1276
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,831
Libertarian

1277
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:00,159

All that would do that with Jenna gray tarp

1281
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:21,919
With millennials

1282

Zahir is Alex Jones Rodger Stone having a little conversation about Rex Tillerson

1291
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,775
This is right around the time that Rex Tillerson

1292
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
Inside the Trump is a f****** moron

1293
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103

That's my very best Intelligence coming out of both my another.

01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,167
That's why I think the president was

1301
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,703
Ruskin putting down

He's talking about coming exit

01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,343
Open

1313
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:11,999
He is really bad about the present he said a lot but other telling Rex Tillerson resign shouldn't before that

1314
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,655
Well you know what the problem is it when the president exercise Authority

1315
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,495
Do a lack of stability

1316
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,311
What is very cool

1317
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
So okay so

1318
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,663
The mainstream media is going to use it

1319
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,687
To show a lack of

1320
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,735
Stability in a very tumultuous

1321
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,551
Court

1322
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
They will use it as evidence

1323
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,111
The thing that is

1324
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
Alex

1325
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:44,767
You realize Rodger stone is lying to your face

1326
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,839
Right now means what it means with Rodger

1327
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:53,215
Let's flash forward to the 16th a little

1328
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,055
About Trump

1329
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
What was the system of appeasement

1330
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
North Korea

1331
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
Still didn't have that

1332
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
He's insane

1333
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,775
Play bad cop

1334
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,759
Turn on inside the Trump

1335
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,951
So

1336
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,999
Estimating that

1337
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Like what's the point

1338
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,839
Every profile on Tillerson

1339
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Fascinates me

1340
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
Because

1341
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
It's always like

1342
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
He didn't want the job

1343
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
Doesn't want the job

1344
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
But now

1345
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,919
Literally the only reason that he is still Secretary of State

1346
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Is because he's worried

1347
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,991
If it's not

1348
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,527
Trump will nuke

1349
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
The world

1350
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,343
That's fascinating

1351
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:21,791
Hilarious imagine there's some truth to that narrative but at the same time it's probably not

1352
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,839
100

1353
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:27,167
Probably subtilty trying to save face

1354
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,983
Tillerson is a PR for tillers

1355
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,311
Is a

1356
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
Horrific monster who shoot

1357
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
Immediately

1358
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
But

1359
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,319
I do think that he is he's the Exxon executive

1360
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Who has

1361
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
Turn his

1362
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,463
Big Fortune into an insanely big Fortune

1363
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,511
Fair

1364
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Coming to

1365
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
He has to know that

1366
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
He doesn't need this s***

1367
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,423
He doesn't need this

1368
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,471
No problem.

1369
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
And now

1370
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:09,407
He's not getting what he wanted out of it

1371
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,687
This is a pain

1372
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
Compton

1373
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,039
In your mouth situation

1374
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,343
Is ever good no ever

1375
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:21,183
So the only reason he's there is because he's worried that if he's not

1376
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:28,351
Trouble Burger everyone that's all good that's hilarious that's all good

1377
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:34,751
Is the difference between those 8 days

1378
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:41,151
The first one

1379
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
Kinder's not there not coordinated

1380
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,135
Good cop

1381
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,207
There's their strategies going on simultaneously

1382
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,743
It's just good it's just

1383
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:02,143
Rogers moved me out

1384
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,191
Updated my programming

1385
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:09,567
You threatened to me about something on Friday

1386
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
Come back on Monday and do better

1387
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,199
It's just so stupid I don't think that

1388
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
I don't know

1389
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
It's too much speculation

1390
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,087
I do know that it

1391
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,135
Like something I do happen to make him

1392
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,695
Completely change his narrative about what's going on with Taylor so

1393
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
Driving

1394
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
Different mood swings

1395
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Probably

1396
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,375
I think that's more likely than Rodger when he's drunk

1397
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,847
I think Stone just

1398
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,383
Loves watching chaos

1399
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
Probably

1400
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:52,319
Stone is loving it whenever he's like stones just smiling at the back of his head like

1401
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,463
Look at this monkey I can make that amazingly powerful feelings

01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:04,351
