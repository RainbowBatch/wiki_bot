1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Thanks for holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Welcome back to another episode of the show what's that a third episode this week are you kidding me

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
Control delivering

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
Even whatever you're doing it's celebratory defensiveness Alex Jones is rubbing off on

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Where me and my friend Jordan

7
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
Discuss

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
Infowars and Generals

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
The hook reason to listen Beyond you just explaining it I watch a lot

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,152
Doll

11
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736
So I like together cleanser that

12
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,648
Listen I like to sit down and I gather Clips like a Pokemon

13
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,512
And I show you what I've got I got myself a Bulbasaur clip

14
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
I got myself a Charizard clip

15
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
And I'm out of poke

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
Anymore

17
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
But

18
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Bi-Mart

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
40

20
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Episode

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
That is

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Tuesday

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
If you're nasty

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
And we're going to get into what goes on on the show

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
Get into some of the lies some of the fun

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
I am

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
Mostly the only plan that we've ever had

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,232
Yeah it's worked out so far

29
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Although we have been taken out

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,632
No no but there's talk there's talk on the

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
There's always

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
Today is

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,336
You might think can we just stop and acknowledge that was probably our best

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,432
It was the smoothest but I also felt lost it tonight

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
The whole time I was kind of going smoothly.

36
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,624
What are we doing alright

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,488
So of course

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
You might expect Jordan

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
The Today's Show would be Alex Jones

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
Screaming his ass off

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
About the tape

42
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
It was posted on Breitbart

43
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
The night before regarding Paul Ryan

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
Would never support Trump

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
I will never support this monster

46
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
I would expect it

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Because that is ended

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,672
It's exactly what you would normally want to talk about

49
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
He's basically doing up like

50
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Air support for Trump

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
All the time

52
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
F****** Paul Ryan's coming over here

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Already Alex doesn't like Paul Ryan plan

54
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
No

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Alex is distracted by other things

56
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
No namely

57
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
That he was mentioned on Saturday night

58
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Alex

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Stop in Alec Baldwin

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Nightlife in Jeddah

61
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
That's it

62
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
Yep okay are we going are we going to go like year-by-year cast by cast

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,704
Oh my God

64
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,592
Despicable is Rob Schneider's good for

65
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,640
I would love it

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Earlier work

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
I would love it if that's what he did but instead

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
I can get

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
Into this this is this is great

70
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
This is pretty close to the beginning of the show this is

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
A couple minutes in

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
He starts by rambling about nothing

73
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Man gets into it

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
He was playing before this that like people say that he is a hate monger

75
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Also already covered the fact that

76
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
He was Lampoon

77
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,480
Representative very pissed off because

78
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
The newest episode

79
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
And if

80
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
It's not good

81
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
The character is taking a turn for the dark is not

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
It's not Alex is not going to like that I haven't watch the new X-Files characters but I bet it's debatable

83
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Also

84
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
I'm not sure I got to go back and watch it

85
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
But anyway

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,919
NBC and CBS respectively

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Remember that

88
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,975
Impressive

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
Feeling is like he has his social

90
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
He's got his life

91
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Force

92
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,215
You just keep in mind that he's that seems to be thinking about identity is being stolen

93
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
And not

94
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
You know

95
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Not being accurate

96
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
And then

97
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,247
No contacts no real

98
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
In the skin if you didn't see it

99
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
I did not

100
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
It's on Independence Day and there's aliens that have come down

101
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Trump

102
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Alec Baldwin playing Trump

103
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
Gives the speech to a bunch of

104
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,799
Bunch of soldiers were getting ready to do battle with these aliens and he's like

105
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
Aliens Walk Among Us they've been here for years

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,479
I heard this on Infowars Alex Jones is a gray radio broadcaster

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Keenan is like

108
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
What aliens live here in the camp there's one right over there

109
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
8 points at Leslie Jones

110
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Okay.

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,023
And another one right next to her and it says this year's Amada

112
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,839
Is everybody

113
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Yeah

114
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:05,055
It's a joke as we've documented Alex has a dubious grasp on race

115
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Doesn't mean that

116
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
People

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
The point

118
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
Pics of black people are alien

119
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
I think for comedic effect

120
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,647
Are they a little

121
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
How much are they how much could they possibly be exaggerated under doing it

122
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
Same thing if you know exactly how awful Alex

123
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Kind of

124
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Yeah

125
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
It's a joke

126
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Is everything

127
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
Just like WinCo bear attacking two weeks ago

128
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
You are proud shows don't you

129
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Yes

130
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Well the house together

131
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
The remnants

132
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,847
Is on the lease I can get

133
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Hey listen

134
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
So what are you doing what's going on

135
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Could you

136
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
He just skipped

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,391
Into this storyline that he's mentioned before in the past but I have no evidence of this

138
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,671
I don't know if this is

139
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,999
He claims that one of his reporters

140
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Got evicted

141
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Because the landlord

142
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
Thought that Alex Jones was a bigot

143
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
And they work for Alex Jones

144
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,935
Which is that did happen

145
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
That's a loss

146
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Yeah that's

147
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Is it illegal

148
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:45,919
Discrimination

149
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
Yeah which is why I know it didn't happen

150
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
So anyway

151
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
Yeah but it makes no sense

152
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
SNL made fun of me just like Colbert made fun of

153
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
Cuz me and because of cold air

154
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Employee got evicted

155
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,103
Yeah if you're if you're trying to diagram the sentence that's what he saying just listening to it straight through I'm glad you asked

156
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Cuz it makes no sense

157
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,295
My faults not respect

158
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
They say

159
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:54,271
I'm at your house

160
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,559
Opposing of the president Baldwin

161
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,919
Never pretended to be a reporter

162
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,247
That involved the news and he's a late night talk show hosts

163
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Does Alex really not understand that

164
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
He doesn't

165
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,815
It really doesn't get that he does because of a Clipper going to play later

166
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
Where he gets into the idea of fiction and reality

167
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
Really Illuminating

168
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
There's a lot of projection

169
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
So much projection in this episode

170
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
It gets really weird

171
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Real weird

172
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Michael's boxes

173
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Eon

174
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,151
Ameren

175
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
Guaranteed

176
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
I want to do

177
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,103
Bill O'Reilly

178
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Police

179
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Graceful definition

180
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
Delusional

181
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
Delusional

182
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Really great video

183
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,079
I was yapping arcade days know what the O'Reilly clip was but

184
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Willing to believe that they got it at that way

185
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
I'm willing to believe Alex's version of it

186
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Which is

187
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Shady

188
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Well

189
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
You know what let's not it look on a gauge of the weather or not this is real this comes down

190
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
Fact that he said that's the greatest form of defamation you can do to Sam Ash cut to Alex

191
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
So implying

192
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Is a pedophile

193
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Yep is the

194
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
The greatest form of defamation

195
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
You can do to somebody

196
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Yep

197
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
Okay

198
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Alright

199
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Alex Jones

200
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,695
Know what he says ever at any point in time

201
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,023
No memories

202
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Situation where every word is the first word he's ever spoke

203
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
I think it must be that sort of thing he's like a like really fast acting guy from Memento or it's just all gone immediately

204
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Either that or he knows that

205
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
It's vaguely enough to what he says

206
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
The Killing rape children

207
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
It's not really a specific defamation on anybody but then when

208
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Yeah

209
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
Alex Jones is code that means kill and drink the blood of children

210
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
But yes

211
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
He has committed the worst defamation

212
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
The moment it happened

213
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Security

214
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
Violence solves every problem

215
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Houston

216
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:26,399
Is the UE Bowl political talk

217
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Physically

218
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,055
It's so childish it's insanity

219
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
I disagree with you philosophically

220
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
So let's fight

221
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
My Philosophy is right

222
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
You know what I wish that was further away from Heather

223
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Might makes right

224
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
If he doesn't matter these are the tenants

225
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Of the World of Alex Jones

226
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
I mean we just got to get used to it if we're going to dwell in a nice clip

227
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Where he hasn't narrative

228
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
I think it's pretty interesting

229
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Get into right here

230
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
Percent off on the Trump Pence

231
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,159
Dot-com

232
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,255
All about Free Speech meeting like-minded people and promoting the truth

233
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Red white and blue shirt

234
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
California schools

235
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Colors

236
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
Muslims

237
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
He's not kidding but he's lying

238
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,463
The ninth circuit like we talked about a bunch

239
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
Just to illustrate how often he brings that up about an Iowa

240
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,935
Football team where people were told not to wear red white blue

241
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Because it offends

242
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
Alex must have just seen a tweet

243
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Because I read up on this story

244
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
Okay

245
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,879
The Tweet blogs

246
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Iowa high school students were forced to apologize for wearing red white blue at a sports game because immigrant students

247
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Seymour Thunder

248
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,399
That's the story on right-wing blogs any other

249
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Part of that story

250
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
That maybe they've opened

251
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
Apologize

252
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
Red white and blue

253
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
Okay but they were never asked

254
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
They weren't forced to at all

255
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
Okay they also shoot

256
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
Have apologized for wearing red white and blue

257
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Because I wasn't the issue

258
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
The reason that the opposing team was pissed off

259
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Was because

260
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
They were screaming racial slurs

261
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
Treason

262
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,383
To be pissed off then wearing red white and blue Deport them

263
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
No and stuff like that there was

264
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
A guy who was there

265
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Was quoted as saying

266
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
You had a Facebook post about it

267
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,439
Just remember we were offended but did not ask for an apology

268
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
Valley willingly apologize to us

269
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
We did not make them apologize

270
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
And then some

271
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Please State exactly what offended you

272
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
The post say it was wearing a patriotic uniform

273
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
If it was more than that then Enlighten us

274
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
And his response

275
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
I don't care what they were wearing

276
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,639
Some of them were screaming racial slurs which is what got me

277
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Maybe more of the story

278
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
That's wicked

279
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
Yeah you know all the way up until then

280
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,695
Not being a bully

281
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
So they apologize for wearing red white blue

282
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Right

283
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,167
Responsibility knowing you have to apologize

284
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,359
Decerebrate

285
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Council it didn't come from the kids who were

286
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
Doing the screaming racial slurs

287
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Okay so I think that it might be

288
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
You scream racial slurs had

289
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Just suddenly diss

290
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
Disappeared to be replaced by people

291
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
People suddenly learning not to yell to wake up hungover.

292
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Oh man

293
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,607
Apologize for Rachel's Lounge

294
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
Is this

295
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Possibility

296
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Apologizing to save face without

297
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
Getting into the muck

298
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
Also September 2016 Demoine register article described

299
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Tensions in this particular School

300
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Fortin Iowa

301
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
A culture of quote deep racial disparity exists in the Valley High School

302
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
Grading and

303
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Students of color according to reports

304
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Iowa State University Research

305
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
The audit found that students of color at the West Des Moines High School

306
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,423
Are more likely to be labeled as special

307
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Then their white peers

308
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
Students of color are also more likely to face discipline or

309
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,335
Suspension and less likely to be tapped for gifted program

310
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
And this is the quote

311
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
The researchers

312
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,223
The Traditions curriculum and teaching methods within the school

313
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,551
Assume students upper-class whiteness is the norm or archetype

314
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
We can marginalize and demoralize Dunes

315
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Color whether intended or not

316
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Now that's

317
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,303
Interesting and about the whole lot of Education

318
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Now here's where it gets

319
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
The report comes more than a year after violent confrontation between

320
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
The series of community discussions on race relations at the school

321
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,663
There were like basically race fight this Iowa school

322
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:05,599
What kind of climate they were living in

323
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
Isn't problem at Valley High School

324
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
And of course it's not commonly reported

325
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,071
Because why would it be at the high school in the middle of America it's just one example of many

326
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
How

327
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,471
But they just ran with it as being about wearing red

328
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
Red white blue

329
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:28,639
Does in the end

330
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Is blame-the-victim

331
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Again

332
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Beside because

333
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
Can Spin A Yarn that's against his narrative

334
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
You can't dig for the facts

335
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
You can't look into it

336
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
He's lying by omission

337
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
It's f****** sad what are the what are the

338
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
This is reported only on right wing

339
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
News.

340
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,543
Local news talked about

341
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,383
Yeah just for

342
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,807
Show me the tweets are basically along the lines of

343
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
Sports to apologize red-white-and-blue

344
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
You know what f***

345
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
F****** this is a pure distraction

346
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
We want but I

347
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,727
I just gave him from but I just like these specific examples because

348
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
It comes down to like what we can pin to the wall there's a lot of stuff that we can't really pin to the wall like I can't

349
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Alex doesn't have horses

350
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
I am good

351
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
Circumstantial evidence

352
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
But he doesn't

353
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
But I can't prove it

354
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,367
You didn't read this article based on the facts of the article

355
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
So this is an instance where the f*** you dude

356
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,791
You're not telling the story you're lying you're a propagandist and

357
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
Huseman calling other people erase pimp

358
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,495
I would say if anybody is doing that sort of behavior it's you that exact moment

359
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Committed

360
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,383
Race temporary defamation

361
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Possibly

362
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,063
And you know who's willing to fight you

363
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
We all know

364
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
Fights for sexual favors

365
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,608
Also let's do the big picture of Representative Stephen King

366
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,192
Who is nationalist

367
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,752
Yeah and he's not even bothering anymore

368
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
No buts

369
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,176
I was about to blow up this f***** up stuff going on

370
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
Iowa City

371
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
Let's just call that one Candlelight

372
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Tent

373
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Some white Nash

374
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,960
Culture with other people's babies

375
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
Potentially call Ryan

376
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Stead

377
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
I think

378
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Need to clarify

379
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
And then he clarified his comments

380
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
I meant exactly what I said

381
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Exactly what I said

382
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Paul Ryan when asked for comment regarding

383
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
To clarify state

384
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,928
If I were Paul Ryan the second time by responsibility

385
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:28,352
This supports the the reality

386
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:33,728
The GOP is now only for dumb people

387
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,896
No one else white racism in his life

388
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Nazis

389
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
VSCO

390
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
Prosperity

391
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
Anyway this clip is not John

392
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,696
He goes from talking about this basketball team lying about them

393
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Turkey

394
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
But when he brings up turkey

395
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
What are you doesn't do is bring up the his

396
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
What is that working for them are you sure it wasn't

397
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,192
That

398
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,752
You're no longer allowed to wear red white and blue on

399
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Siri

400
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
Well then you don't feel like she part of the country

401
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
Oregon

402
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
Ruler of Europe

403
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,352
Wow is General Flynn

404
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Hey

405
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
Keys from occupied Texas break

406
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,008
Just learn how to say the goddamn

407
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
I have fine

408
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
George

409
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,408
Jorge

410
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:54,112
Whether it is WHOTV NBC Valley Sudafed USA team

411
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
North

412
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
Refugee athletes

413
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328
North Refuge

414
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
So that's him reading the headline of the story

415
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
He picks the team name is North Refugee ask

416
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
That is not the name of the team

417
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Sets

418
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
Yep bingo

419
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,904
Do you does that make you see a vision of a bat

420
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,464
Basketball jersey

421
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
Syria as their mascot

422
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
The team is

423
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
The Tigers

424
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
I looked it up

425
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
We have the

426
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
The North Rhett

427
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
TDS which is one of the most common

428
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
We have the Tiger

429
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
Did they vote for that at

430
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
Play where those two ever an option one

431
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
It might it might have been you know what we want to be unique

432
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
Fair enough

433
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,936
I was kind of worried I want to I want to bring this up a tiny bit because

434
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
We're going to get

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
A little bit

436
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
Today you tweeted app

437
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Paul Joseph Watson

438
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Prison Planet

439
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Me into a panic

440
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,736
Entire day

441
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
I found this clip

442
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,368
Feel like we might be okay

443
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Because I

444
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Alex Jones

445
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Describes how he likes

446
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
To take a joke

447
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:42,912
Oh good already world we know that he liked

448
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:48,032
To take a joke unfortunately by the end of this clip I'm starting to wonder if he actually likes to take a picture

449
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
Do you think even knows what a joke

450
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Greg is unclear but the

451
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Well let him decide

452
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
From

453
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
Screaming

454
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
Another

455
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Okay Goo

456
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,688
With daily matchups

457
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,976
Before we didn't like how he takes

458
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
I want to be clear that I kind of agree with him

459
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,424
And this is one of my big principles is taking him out of context like that is incredibly day

460
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
It really only feeds into his game

461
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,032
Oh yeah what we're doing

462
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Is still laughing at him

463
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Very so much work

464
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
But it's a half minutes long

465
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136
Instead of us commenting on it

466
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
There is just

467
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Techno music

468
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
17th

469
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Free movies

470
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
Entertain

471
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:18,144
But that you could never have

472
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,728
I really do agree with him

473
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
People

474
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,056
Doing these videos are sort of playing

475
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,736
We're going to check him out you know they want to know more about who is this f****** Wingnut

476
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:39,136
I don't know I don't think they're going to convert tons of people or anything like that

477
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
I'm not saying that they're doing something bad I'm just saying

478
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
There are negative

479
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Side effects

480
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,400
Like a joke and that will be one of my main PCS

481
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
For the entirety of

482
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,472
He is he is a joke

483
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
But he is a he's like he's like

484
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
The Killing Joke

485
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
The Joker

486
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
That's what

487
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,248
He just so bad look at Rulli bigoted joke that everyone seems to like

488
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
Yeah.

489
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,160
If if they're sending people to have the worry that I have is that

490
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
He's becoming

491
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
More

492
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Disseminated in the popular

493
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
While I was saying that I realized

494
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
That is a

495
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Exactly what we're helping

496
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,264
Not really we can explode no because we'll be too late

497
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,664
Alex Jones

498
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576

499
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,856

Anyway don't spoil Game of Thrones let's get to Alex Jones

504
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
My son loves it your school up

505
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,760
From 50 years ago that oldest Cub suit

506
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
By the way

507
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
That records

508
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:21,536
That reference is going to miss all of your Millennials that are coming over from the AV club

509
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,608
No f****** idea

510
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
I don't know probably

511
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Goddamn sitcom

512
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,240
Look it up while we are red

513
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
I don't I don't know how to spell it

514
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
I don't want to ask

515
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,176
In here

516
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Most comments

517
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
When you read them

518
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,720
This is the guy that says whites are superior to black people

519
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Never said that

520
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,632
This is a guy that says he's Superior genetically to Denzel Washington when he's old and ugly

521
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,528
2018

522
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,624
So he actually shows the comment thread on the baby club video

523
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,024
Buckwild

524
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,864
So jokes, threats and

525
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
Is it tag tag tag

526
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,216
That's worth it

527
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Communal

528
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Comment thread where it's kind of the same people always in

529
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
Conversation with

530
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
So in this one

531
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,200
Start because the video in question he does some rapping in it

532
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:49,344
He like people were started as we can drop

533
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
Like Alex Jones raps

534
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
And one of them has a rap lyric

535
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
Of him like IMAX

536
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,656
Blah blah blah I don't like black people

537
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Recent album

538
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
Is bringing an album back from the

539
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Future in order to release

540
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
Why does the conservative

541
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:26,976
I don't think so

542
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
With

543
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,304
How many people

544
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
Do we know who have that kind of level of nurses

545
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,216
Absolutely read

546
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Like

547
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
Put a Facebook post

548
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
It turns into one of those Facebook

549
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
They will absolutely turn to you at

550
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
And read the

551
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Hi my

552

We know people who would do

Fear

554
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
A hypothetical million-strong audience

555
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,792
Oh my god look up

556
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Emails from Caddyshack

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
Not schmelz

558
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,360
Sounded very Honeymooners

559
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,944
He says he's 43 a motherfuker

560
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
A+

561
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:27,136
Anyone not look like a 43-year old days

562
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
This is like f****** hard that's true that's true

563
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Pseudo-intellectual

564
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Sorry for these people this morning

565
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
And every single moment in the world

566
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,712
President of the world

567
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Empowerment

568
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784

You did that it was great

Every Benchmark I'm very success

622
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,672
And they do have little ceremonies and celebrations that I'm not successful

623
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,744
I don't disagree that you fixed so but this is soap

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
This is really sad

625
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
Select the two the two responses

626
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,216
I will fight you and then being like so defensive about being successful

627
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
It's insane

628
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
I swear to god let's just talk for

629
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
For 2 hours

630
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,760
About that person we got a four-star review on iTunes it almost made me freak out

631
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,856
You ruined our Stars for stars

632
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,928
How dare you

633
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,232
You know what you're probably one of the 90s

634
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,560
Percent of conservative years old

635
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
And living above their parents grave

636
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,216
Play videogames all day

637
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
Delusional

638
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
I'm reasonably successful

639
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Alright

640
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,856
That because

641
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
Who I am

642
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,256
Shelves better than that person

643
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,400
Blah blah blah

644
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
He's a bad guy

645
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
Young people

646
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:46,368
Young B that was weird guilt

647
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
And then they

648
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
ComEd

649
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
I want the Washington movies

650
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,528
Absolutely

651
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,464
Alex Jones

652
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,048
You just described him here

653
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
Cookie Monster

654
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
Must be true

655
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,080
Is David

656
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
Yes he does know well David

657
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Says he's

658
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:55,744
I don't think anyone needs to Brand Alex Jones as anything other than Alex Jones

659
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,864
We let him live and die by his own words

660
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
Cookie Monster

661
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
I don't like what

662
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Cookie Monster

663
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
You're sad about

664
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
F******

665
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
It's a it's a

666
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Farce

667
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,160
Commentary that has his own YouTube

668
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,232
So it's

669
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
After this dissection ended I was like

670
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,120
Maybe he doesn't like being made fun of and he's trying to pretend

671
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Cuz he knows it's gracious

672
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
To be made fun of and

673
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
You know Rose

674
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
It's all that stuff all that

675
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
You know sort of a social thing we're busting balls is a

676
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Communicate friendship a lot of time

677
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Does next clip that plays up

678
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
Immediately after

679
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,712
Made me realize

680
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
No more after that

681
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,392
Previously only because it gets

682
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,160
Much worse

683
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
With the faking people

684
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,560
Every color of every region of every

685
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,920
One of those is a real word one of those MW guts

686
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,528
In the system works because

687
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
People don't differentiate now

688
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
No you don't

689
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
You don't play

690
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,072
This is where we get some pot calling the kettle black action

691
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
Here is where Alex

692
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
Surly project

693
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,728
Exactly what he does on to those who criticize him

694
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
And it's fascinating

695
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,592
They don't know the difference between truth and methacton bro

696
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Come on

697
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,456
All of your analogies end up citing movies

698
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
You just think

699
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Here comes a deep dive

700
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
Usher

701
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Computerworld

702
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Trump

703
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Again he's responding

704
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
The commenter

705
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Biggest waste of time ever

706
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
You sit here in the lap of freedom

707
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,376
You sit here in the lap of the West and then bitching about it we have no idea your ally yourself with

708
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,984
China

709
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,288
Nope I left the corner there

710
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Noah

711
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Nope

712
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,807
Do you miss the point of any coverage about that it was hey that's

713
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,159
F***** up and going over there that's not cool at all

714
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
Nope

715
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,791
Don't do that. That was fuked up

716
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:10,815
So

717
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
That's a little Potbelly Goblin launches missiles at Japan

718
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
North

719
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,479
Drop bombs on piangi

720
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
Little little money

721
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,863
Little one

722
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:53,311
Freedom Wild Wild West

723
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Whiteboard

724
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,871
Scales

725
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,687
Again this is a business because somebody

726
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Commented

727
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:06,367
This is this is all in response response Jesus somehow

728
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
Did the North Korea situation

729
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,767
Which is agreed f*** it's f***** up

730
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
But be that as it may

731
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,863
Then he gets into Kim Jong-il as a tiny dick

732
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,423
In college is there

733
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,823
Whiteboards went over and remember that is not what's going on

734
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
Something it's usually a specific color they had a rash of racial slurs

735
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Used on whiteboards

736
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
And at the safest Michigan

737
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,623
They were called the same time

738
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,951
They recognize all communication was being done through social media

739
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:47,327
So what's the point of having their if they're being used to harass people

740
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,143
Exactly that's

741
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Thing that you

742
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:55,519
You should be angry now I think what Alex Jones is about to say is beyond book burning

743
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
That's his take on it

744
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:03,455
No no the white boards is beyond book Burn

745
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
Beyond

746
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,039
It's trying to ban the written word

747
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
That is one option the first time we agreed that it wasn't this isn't the best

748
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Erasing awake

749
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
Is exactly like burning up

750
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Rewrites

751
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Yes

752
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
An everlasting book

753
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Yeah

754
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,223
Mother and father yours

755
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
You're not the cool people

756
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
So uncool

757
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,391
You'll get it

758
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,303
Morons don't know the life I've LED what I've done any other you sit there in your mommy's basement

759
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Value is

760
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
81

761
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
A twice-divorced

762
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,455
214

763
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
What

764
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,575
What is he talking

765
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:18,975
Oh man God

766
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,071
Hand of yelling at these people about a comment thread on the a.v. club

767
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,447
We've done love it so episode 23

768
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
50 hours

769
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:35,615
Just analyzing his racism is massaging his a lot islamophobia is idiocy

770
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
She's gone

771
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
Freak out if he finds this

772
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
You know what we got here

773
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,015
Here's the thing

774
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
Why

775
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,855
Because then you'd have to listen to it

776
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,207
He would have to add

777
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,767
Engages with that video

778
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
Could watch them

779
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
Vlog

780
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,775
Episode titles

781
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
Alex Jones is a big dumb fat

782
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
He would know everything about us

783
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
March 14th

784
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,135
He's not going to know maybe I should make some small YouTube videos that are salaciously title

785
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,719
Maybe I'll work on that for the near future

786
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Ethos

787
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
Edited out of context

788
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,703
Good idea

789
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
The world

790
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
About us as if it's some magic powers

791
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:03,679
Want to hurt you I know you understand

792
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
So I'm reaching out to you like Junior High

793
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,687
Real world

794
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,479
And get out of mommy's basement

795
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,255
It's not

796
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
But do you know what it is

797
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,423
People responding to the things he's saying appropriately

798
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Play people who've done some

799
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
Projector

800
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
I think about kids learning not to lie insecurities

801
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Trying to escape from the year

802
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
It's entirely possible

803
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
Let's get to our next clip

804
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
Why is he so mad

805
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,439
I don't know is not done

806
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
Alec Baldwin

807
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,679
We had a special report on this episode

808
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
From The One and Only

809
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
Paul Joseph Watson

810
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
PJ

811
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
So I promise

812
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
At one point that we would never play his voice on this show

813
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
Honor that this next clip

814
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Is 30 seconds

815
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,903
In honor of you treating at him

816
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,743
I'm going to play a tiny bit of his special report

817
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,351
He did a special report about how Snoop Dogg is an a******

818
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Basically because

819
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
Snoops got a new video out where he

820
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
Hold the gun up to the head of a truck

821
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,543
Look alike

822
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
A clown version of trump

823
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,151
And he pulls the trigger and has like a bang flag

824
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,223
Comes out of it right classic classic

825
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:57,343
It's cartoon and they're super mad about it they're real someone who has been

826
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
Convicted on gun charges

827
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,439
They call him a pimp

828
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
They were screaming about how he like

829
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
Was working

830
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,447
With the CIA to prepare black youth

831
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:16,031
To go to prison that's what rap music is all about

832
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,359
And all rap music

833
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
Is the prison pipeline

834
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Not

835
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
The judges

836
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,695
Mostly focusing on

837
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Is

838
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
The idea that

839
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,047
Fake assassinate Trump

840
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
Pictures of a bang flag comes out of it

841
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
It's like a Daffy Duck

842
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,983
Would actually

843
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Put out of

844
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Video

845
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,311
Where they say

846
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
They know

847
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
Snoop Dogg

848
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
Murder was the case that they gave them

849
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Anyway

850
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Paul Joseph Watson

851
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Say something

852
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Super unfortunate

853
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
Heavily edited report

854
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
To the point

855
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
So much time on this

856
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
It's pathetic

857
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
Check that this was still in it

858
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
He has really quick cuts

859
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Adam saying

860
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Complete

861
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
Of him giving a speech

862
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
It's like

863
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
5 Seconds

864
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,151
Cut 5 Seconds cut cut cut cut cut

865
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
It's it's

866
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
Basically

867
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,247
The Triana

868
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,295
It's tit appeal to low attention

869
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:35,391
Japan people with like constantly moving YouTube Style

870
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,439
Kind of

871
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:42,559
Maybe I've watched enough to know he's quoting other people

872
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
Sweets or things that he doesn't like

873
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
He does like

874
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,703
Mimimimimimimi voice filter

875
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Smartworld

876
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,359
Enjoy this

877
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
Depictions

878
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,319
What racist

879
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,927
Trump

880
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
Well I mean that's an interesting thought experiment but I mean

881
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
I don't know if we could ever

882
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
Come up with

883
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
An example

884
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
That would go against

885
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,735
What he just said Nugent

886
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:39,135
Has said anything inflammatory someone would die

887
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
From this clip of Ted

888
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Jim concert

889
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,343
Wonder

890
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
Is that good

891
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,207
I mean was the song Good

892
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,487
I don't know

893
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,559
I don't know what's good after that

894
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:23,935
Is poor reporting on your

895
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
The video is walking around on stage with two machine guns in his hand and telling Obama to

896
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
Suck his machine gun

897
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
That's worse

898
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:39,039
It wasn't a music video though imagine if it was a music video

899
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
Depiction

900
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
Threatening to kill the president

901
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,255
That's a whole different thing that's protected by live performance

902
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
It's like it's like cover band

903
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,447
As long as they don't video that they're covering

904
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
The song without

905
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
Looking for you forever

906
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
That's

907
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
It's not but

908
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,639
Hey this is you know what

Dammit

911
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,927
Paul Joseph Watson just got busted not doing anything

912
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:20,767
At 1

913
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
Pacific Rim

914
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
There's so many others

915
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,447
Also also

916
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,031
Right after that he's like then I flew to New York and I said Hillary Clinton

917
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,079
Suck on my machine gun

918
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
7-Eleven

919
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
All these liberal leaders

920
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,159
Was on the Alex Jones Show a week ago

921
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,607
So many other reference

922
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
Did a video

923
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,239
Where he killed Obama

924
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,823
Write a reasonable answer

925
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,383
I wish they would have used Toby Keith

926
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,919
Fitzpatrick Realty

927
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
Necessarily

928
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,247
He played at one of those inauguration

929
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Can parties if it's super weird

930
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Toby Keith singing pretty reason

931
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,647
Outside of that

932
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
911 song

933
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
Yeah

934
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
How do I

935
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,863
That I like that the only time we're ever going to call

936
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Karaoke upon

937
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:40,127
The eagle will fly

938
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Anyway

939
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,503
I love it only time we're ever going to play Paul Joseph Watson

940
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
On the show is

941
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
Is a clip where

942
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
A f******

943
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
How

944
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
U-Pick

945
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
The one referee

946
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
The one guy

947
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,791
Ohmwrecker

948
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:04,191
Threatening to kill the president

949
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
People who could have been president

950
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
They're dumb

951
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
That's

952
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
They're really dumb is the editor-in-chief of Infowars he's the guy

953
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,527
Who's been tricked by private message

954
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Repeatedly in the pot

955
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,879
He's the editor machine checking

956
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,719
We take a break from this

957
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
Normal day

958
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
I know he's in London Jolly Old London

959
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,447
Piece of paper that they just scrunch up and then throw it out Amanda

960
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Probably

961
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,311
I mean I'll probably be actually more impressive than their actual cyst

962
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Yeah

963
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,127
Anyway we got to get back

964
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,455
This is where Alex Jones

965
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,015
Alec Baldwin has done him wrong

966
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,319
A little bit later in the show so he has to revisit

967
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,343
The topic

968
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Like I wanted to edit it for length

969
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,511
I can't entire segment

970
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,095
It's how long is it's probably 4 minutes long

971
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
From commercial to commercial break

972
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,471
So f***** up

973
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:16,127
Remember earlier when you just started ripping about one of his employees getting kicked out of their apartment

974
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,663
That bad of like

975
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Not track

976
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
It's insane

977
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
He just goes into

978
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,343
Oh weird I really want to spoil what it is

979
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:33,535
With the truth and it's time for you to choose the side

980
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,703
You're listening to Alex Jones

981
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,279
Not realize he's older than you and Bill O'Reilly took

982
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
Jean sexual predators

983
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,471
I know it sounds like this is a repeat from earlier it's not

984
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
Exactly

985
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
But again

986
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,759
You say a lot

987
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
Pizza think it's a lie

988
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,111
Don't ever call me a sexual predator

989
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
Cases that Topshop

990
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Man

991
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
Cool Math

992
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,631
I realize that the

993
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,191
I just went in and out made it sound like I was

994
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,215
Suggesting that Alex

995
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,263
Is a sexual predator and I want to be clear I wasn't

996
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
I just want to be

997
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,359
Much more fair than the Riley group was

998
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
The greatest actors

999
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,295
I only accuse Alex of things that I'm

1000
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Hundred percent

1001
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,767
Don't call me a sexual predator how's your problem

1002
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
And it says

1003
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Hey man

1004
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
He purchased the KKK but has in the past that

1005
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
You've never seen white racism

1006
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Interesting

1007
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
When is the ever protest

1008
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
What did the KKK

1009
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
I don't know

1010
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Good point I don't know

1011
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,119
I like I think this is a new segment

1012
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Call

1013
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,703
Hey man

1014
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:55,871
Strawberry Kush

1015
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,527
Bill O'Reilly is does live in a glass house

1016
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
In terms of that

1017
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
Sexual harassment

1018
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,047
The Fox News for sexual harassment

1019
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
Totally

1020
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,167
On Solid Ground

1021
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Is not Sosa

1022
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,495
Eric gets into like

1023
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,567
Complain about people and then do the exact

1024
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
So we're going we're going from that

1025
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
Segment 2 the dude

1026
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
Oh

1027
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,927
Also so

1028
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,743
When Alexander

1029
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:48,607
There was someone tweeted out

1030
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,399
A clip of Alex Jones

1031
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,679
The fight

1032
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Rights and also the same

1033
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
He just that he wanted

1034
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:07,807
He started on Sunday getting really mad about the Saturday Night Live

1035
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,111
Originally threatened to fight

1036
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,135
Alec Baldwin

1037
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:17,535
And the hill the paper the hill covered it

1038
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
I quoted the tree

1039
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
I retweeted

1040
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
Hey man if you can't make it I'm in

1041
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:31,359
Alex Jones

1042
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:36,735
Money to charity for that has been brought into it

1043
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,087
Is not being brought into the fight narrative because Ron Perlman

1044
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,927
You might think you might say he does but also

1045
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
I thought he said Ron Goldman

1046
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Focus

1047
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:55,679
Why is hellboy's that's why I had to stop and explain

1048
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,287
Hollywood you're entitled

1049
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:05,151
Hollywood bosses do pissing on America promoting all the anti-america crab

1050
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,783
I don't want Hollywood rolls

1051
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:15,647
I don't want to live in Fantasyland

1052
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:26,143
Sexual predator

1053
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,311
Building be big enough

1054
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:37,919
And I would have to just work on my rest but I'm ready to go ready to go

1055
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
Samsung

1056
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,343
You put up a million bucks

1057
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:50,463
Assistant

1058
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
Text me why she wanted I mean I don't know

1059
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,351
He's just did exactly

1060
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:01,727
You I mean you love you love all this I don't know

1061
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
To be cut off I don't know

1062
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,591
Which is worse

1063
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
Glenwood Bill O'Reilly

1064
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,943
Bill O'Reilly was like

1065
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
No he's saying it

1066
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,575
Consciously doing this

1067
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
That could have just been

1068
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Some sort of tech

1069
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,415
Technical issue or something like

1070
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
There's two stories coming up one of them about sexual predators the other is about Alex Jones

1071
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,215
Mix up words like

1072
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,847
It's still not good at that cat killed

1073
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
10 people on

1074
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,175
On the highway

1075
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,479
It's not good but it's like a O'Reilly

1076
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,551
Get your house in order

1077
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
Intentionally

1078
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:53,439
What you accusing other people doing the joy of

1079
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,511
And you put up the million bucks

1080
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,839
I'm going to have its implicit publicity so

1081
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
You all have it

1082
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,751
At least 10

1083
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,823
Putting up a million bucks

1084
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
It's true

1085
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
$12

1086
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,063
Exactly

1087
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
You just show you support Democratic Party

1088
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
Stop

1089
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,583
Runs around girls all the stuff

1090
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
We just put the president

1091
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,079
Mobilizing the military in the veterans

1092
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,615
Did you defend the present

1093
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,943
With the major leaders

1094
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,807
And why not

1095
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,743
If you really doing that

1096
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
Cowboy Ron Perlman

1097
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:07,679
You would then go and you would be fighting Hillary Clinton if you were really fighting demons

1098
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,983
Ron Perlman actor

1099
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
Actor

1100
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
If you were really doing it

1101
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,919
SeaWorld

1102
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
Bread in the Moonlight

1103
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:32,511
I like the opportunity to get a pop shot in and help

1104
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
I like that you was

1105
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
Doing a shoot promo on

1106
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
Alec Baldwin

1107
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,167
Flipped into Goldman for what

1108
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Try to go this mustache

1109
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
But I

1110
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,871
This is where things get

1111
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Really weird

1112
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Really f*****

1113
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Okay

1114
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,903
For your buddy can get up and say a bunch of lies about Donald Trump myself

1115
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
Police Department

1116
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:11,423
It is

1117
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:18,335
Little Jenny has a grandma that loves her parents in a puppy named Toby

1118
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,455
She loves to play an impeached

1119
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Tina

1120
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:30,111
She really is a person and and and she scared she like to come home

1121
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,279
Just to drop her off somewhere where she can get into a mall or whatever and then in the Navy could just disappear and nothing's going to happen

1122
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,887
This isn't going to go well I mean

1123
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,031
You're on TV saying I hate black people

1124
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,991
Colbert said I hate gay people

1125
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,903
Understand you're messing with real

1126
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
People

1127
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
Real people

1128
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,631
Call Paul Hollywood

1129
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
So break the break

1130
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,407
What the entire segment screaming about Alec Baldwin

1131
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:30,271
I've been getting into a weird kidnapped

1132
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,087
And taking a Delanco Florida real fast

1133
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:37,695
No it's going up to dunk it

1134
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
Hitting the rim

1135
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:45,375
Falling on his backhand like breaking three vertebrate

1136
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:51,519
Is the kid the mom and the dog the name

1137
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,407
What are you going to do with her just drop her off at a ball

1138
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,247
Well thought-out

1139
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:05,855
Like that's the only time I've been convinced he prepared

1140
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,255
You know what I am not going to insinuate any of the things that I would

1141
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,047
Normally

1142
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,863
Let's just leave it there everybody you just heard it

1143
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,399
You can make your own conclusions

1144
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,679
Cuz now it's time

1145
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,703
To get to a gas

1146
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
Ladies and gentlemen

1147
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,335
I think he said that Snoop Dogg is in a real person

1148
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,127
He's not a real Crip

1149
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,687
Is that they're pretending to be a Crip

1150
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
He is a punk

1151
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
I don't know why he's a punk

1152
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,695
Yeah I trust

1153
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,743
Story of his own life

1154
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
I don't have any reason not to

1155
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,143
No seems pretty love

1156
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Anyway

1157
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,519
On this episode on the 4th

1158
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Alex Hanna

1159
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
The ground break

1160
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
Is one of the most hateful bigot

1161
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
In all the talk radio

1162
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,295
One Michael Savage

1163
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,463
He's the host of The Savage Nation

1164
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,511
And the intro of the Savage Nation

1165
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Welcome to the Savage

1166
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Contain

1167
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
Full disclosure I do another podcast with somebody who's obsessed with Michael Savage

1168
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:32,383
Who gives me his Clips in that I reacted.

1169
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Contain

1170
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,295
Adult content apologies I'm way better on that other

1171
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,087
Emotional

1172
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
He says it is emotional music

1173
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,719
Anyway

1174
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
Michael Savage

1175
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,535
The worst

1176
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,863
No unfortunately Alex Jones really respect

1177
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
Michael Savage

1178
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,471
So it's kind of boring recognize game it's really boring interview

1179
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:01,055
Just trying to have a conversation about how Liberals are crazy

1180
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,455
Both of them are known for interrupt

1181
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
People and yelling

1182
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
Did because there's respect

1183
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
Between them they don't do that

1184
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,343
Unfortunately there

1185
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,647
Two instances that I found

1186
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
Sit there staring at a

1187
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,255
They're over Skype

1188
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
What we do here now

1189
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
Never have gas

1190
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
He just into the studio and scream

1191
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
It's great it's horrible

1192
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
You said it was great

1193
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
For what

1194
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,455
So this is a clip

1195
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,991
Where

1196
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,807
Is there to get into the idea

1197
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
This podcast.

1198
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Up Is Down in

1199
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,391
There's no doubt

1200
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:52,255
It's horrible

1201
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,887
Biscuit bigotry

1202
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
And Alex Jones

1203
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
Tries to let

1204
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,983
Michael Savage

1205
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
The hook

1206
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
About some stuff

1207
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,591
And Michael Savage is such a bigot

1208
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
He won't take the bait

1209
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
This is fascinate

1210
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:15,039
Israel

1211
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
He's talking about the New World Order and like take

1212
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
Getting out

1213
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Nationalist

1214
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,583
Midstates there's Israel and Russia

1215
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
But I

1216
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,727
That I want to get a little bit of contact

1217
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:42,431
The Nationalist Nation Jewish identity

1218
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,295
Russia

1219
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Here we go

1220
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:54,719
A bunch of degenerate child molesters

1221
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,023
Alex

1222
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,607
And that's why the illegitimate perverted left is going insane

1223
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,447
If you seen that people

1224
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:15,711
I want to just take a second cuz we're going to get to him like really hanging himself

1225
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,039
But like can you tell already he's a better broadcast

1226
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:24,415
He has a cake to his voice that even though what he's saying is horrible

1227
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,999
I kind of like the tone of his voice says it very he says it was a great time

1228
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:33,375
To talk about a great meatball sub or like a nice walk in the park

1229
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
It's really great

1230
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:38,495
I love listening to him when he's not saying his opinion

1231
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:43,103
If he were images abuses in audiobook reader weed

1232
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,431
Define

1233
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:49,247
Creative nonfiction but not about like

1234
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,087
The Jews or the globalists or NWO shitt

1235
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,879
I would be totally under it

1236
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,207
Anyway radical lesbian

1237
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Anyway here we go

1238
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:09,215
Mostly

1239
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,799
About the most extreme

1240
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:27,647
And I just watched a lot of behavior

1241
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,439
Everybody

1242
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,279
Fake

1243
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,959
Okay

1244
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
We all know that

1245
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:46,591
She fortunately for me I'm a cultural Anthropologist prior to becoming Doctrine

1246
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,831
Every human being has built

1247
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
Call Matt

1248
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
You are correct

1249
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,807
If I do not

1250
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:34,207
But don't you see

1251
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:38,303
Don't you see also that Michael Savage takes far more ownership of his own

1252
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Even Alex.

1253
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,679
I don't think he would say that he's a bigot or anything negative

1254
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
The people I'm talking about

1255
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,407
You know which one I hate Michael Savage

1256
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,223
But I respect him a bunch more than Alex

1257
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,015
It's because of that that sort of like

1258
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,087
If you don't judge based on race

1259
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:06,975
On this podcast the people we've revealed that you respect

1260
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,279
Racist horrible broadcast

1261
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,935
Misunderstood album is amazing

1262
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:21,311
I don't like him for his bigotry or anything like that

1263
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
One of your

1264
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Amplify

1265
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Perhaps

1266
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
To an extreme degree

1267
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
Create

1268
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
A false perception of

1269
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,927
Listen to Ricky monster

1270
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,231
You shut up

1271
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:42,047
What's bare-knuckle fight

1272
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,351
Million-dollar

1273
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
America is the greatest

1274
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
Discrimination

1275
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,543
Our nation is the greatest nation on Earth

1276
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
I am

1277
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
Stun

1278
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,431
Which is why I don't want to live in

1279
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,455
I don't want

1280
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:02,015
Destination to start looking like the third world

1281
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
That is becoming a lots of America

1282
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:09,695
If you flooded

1283
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,231
To make themselves

1284
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
Be like Americans speak

1285
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,071
Act like

1286
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,143
Minorities Act

1287
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,495
Why won't they assimilate America

1288
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Raped

1289
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:30,431
American1cu aspire to be more like us white people

1290
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,831
The Pinnacle of human achievement

1291
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,855
He goes on to be like

1292
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:43,999
I thought there was nothing else. I remember that he's he's like

1293
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,559
Bring up there stupid flag

1294
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
What's the World Cup

1295
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:58,335
You dickweed

1296
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:04,735
Here's the other clip of Michael Savage advocating for a new house on American Activities Committee

1297
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:08,063
Because our children's children many of them won't even get married

1298
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,343
Is so intimidated

1299
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,159
By the social forces against family

1300
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:18,303
Against normalcy they won't even get married

1301
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,607
When you look at the psychic

1302
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,703
You almost need to send your children to school with a garden

1303
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:30,591
I got to ask you

1304
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,479
You're right is Trump's War it's our war it's nationalism is returning Prosperity just common sense. Left a ride

1305
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,367
The war isn't over it's just begun we all got to be more involved than ever

1306
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,671
Dublin

1307
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,231
Soros

1308
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,823
Let's put that aside no one will ever believe that

1309
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,151
But they will come to understand with hearing

1310
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
How does a gray

1311
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
Immigrant to America

1312
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:13,599
Gave 65 Violet black lives matter movement

1313
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,951
And I have you have to see this Alex

1314
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:23,071
I named every subversive group in America

1315
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:29,215
From

1316
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,543
All you do is say Soros and I'm off and running at the races

1317
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,359
I'm sure I'm not going to read this book

1318
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,551

Shriners

1332
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,863
They're not even doing anything for General Motors

1333
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,631

These are the groups that need to be investigated with a new us

1343
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,703
House of an American Activities Committee

1344
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,775

They're afraid of really big

1347
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,255
Michael Savage is not allowed in England because of

1348
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,303
A bunch of really violent

1349
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,839
Talk that he's had in the past

1350
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
About Muslim

1351
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,655
England decided

1352
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
We don't want

1353
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
You and your rhetoric

1354
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
In our country

1355
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,007
He is on the list

1356
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,567
In some really f***** up,

1357
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,639
The list of people who are not allowed

1358
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
It's like

1359
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,479
War criminals

1360
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,575
Richard Spencer's on that list also

1361
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Michael Savage

1362
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,439
He almost managed to get

1363
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:02,559
They were really close to doing that

1364
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
I love the

1365
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Love that

1366
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Dumb like

1367
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,191
Do you know how much that would anger the people in Hollywood

1368
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
Bring a house of an American activities

1369
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Yeah

1370
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:18,432
It was really scary the first time everyone

1371
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:23,552
The Inquisition

1372
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,696
Like it's super reasonable for them to be

1373
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,792
How much do you know how much it would scare group

1374
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:38,144
If you brought back the thing that hunted group X

1375
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,472
Well I mean any any

1376
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,520
Do you know how much it was

1377
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:47,104
Scare professors if you brought back the cultural revolution

1378
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:51,968
The other things

1379
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
It's not being taken

1380
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
Is that the history

1381
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,576
Of the house on American Activities Committee

1382
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
Was not

1383
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
It being run well

1384
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
Like

1385
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,536
It didn't that was very much not the case didn't route out

1386
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,584
Like it's super versiv communist

1387
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
People

1388
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,912
It ended up punishing tons of people for

1389
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Minor

1390
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
Things that aren't even crimes

1391
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,824
Yeah it was a witch filiation it was absolutely

1392
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,176
So do your Advocates bringing back

1393
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
The witch hunter

1394
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,344
Ron Perlman

1395
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,952
Wasn't Vin Diesel in Nicolas Cage

1396
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,512
Also that movie is a big bummer

1397
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,840
Is this woman a witch or not

1398
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:46,496
She's a demon witches don't even play into it

1399
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,336
First Season of the Witch

1400
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:54,176
So that's all I got from Michael Savage

1401
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,712
What's the rest of the interview was pretty boring

1402
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,648
They have no idea logical disagree

1403
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Whatsoever

1404
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
Maybe only

1405
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,256
L-like by degrees

1406
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:11,840
Only at like

1407
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
How far they're willing to go with it

1408
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,960
Violence.

1409
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,752
Stuff like that

1410
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,544
How much more open

1411
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
Michael Savage

1412
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,128
Like how how like

1413
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,688
He's a guy who has come into his own in a

1414
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Is comfortable in his

1415
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
Where's Alex

1416
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:33,088
It's still trying to play with

1417
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,624
I hate people

1418
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
Like everybody

1419
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
Different markets

1420
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,888
You apparently had tons of money before even got into Brock

1421
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,936
I don't know the full story

1422
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Yeah yeah

1423
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
Gotcha

1424
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:54,848
At the end of Michael Savage

1425
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
He decides

1426
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Going to pick up his neck

1427
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,688
Big story of the day

1428
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:01,504
Is it that Alec Baldwin did a CIT on him

1429
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
No

1430
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,368
You did the first two hours on that now we're into the third hour

1431
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
2 hours

1432
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:15,072
3rd hour he decides to get going on

1433
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,144
Is about how that lady

1434
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424

01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:35,808
Sure public real bad for him to say you're lucky to be here

1440
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,904
This country

1441
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,256
Nope absolutely

1442
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
It starts with Alex

1443
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,656
Talkin about a how you socialize a

1444
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,472
How is that socialized

1445
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,032
A little bit

1446
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,336
I love learning more about his childhood

1447
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
The small drip

1448
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
We get

1449
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,224
Are so f***** up

1450
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
That the reality is either

1451
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Really really

1452
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:07,808
Boring

1453
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,160
Yeah like his

1454
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
His childhood was either in

1455
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
Same

1456
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Beatings

1457
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Or it was like

1458
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,632

There's more towards the latter than the prior

1462
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,616
This lady

1463
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Acrostic

1464
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
Spoiler alert

1465
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,504
He has a weird Twist on it

1466

Wristband

1467
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,888

Strengthen the wrist to find out

1469
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,056

Anthropologie

1474

And sociology

1475
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,096
Call animal psychology

1476
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:33,568
Scared

1477
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:41,504
And other people that are insecure resonate with Adam

1478
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,600
Universities mobile Florida collectors do

1479
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
If they try to create

1480
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,416
Say old individual

1481
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Show

1482
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,000
That's the most

1483
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Projection

1484
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
Has he ever gone to

1485
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Therapist

1486
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,800
No cuz Ian Rapoport

1487
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,872
Yeah but I mean like when he was younger as always

1488
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,040
That's why he had to leave the more than a forty-year-old Bonita 14

1489
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:21,440
Cuz you knew f****** Rapoport

1490
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,000
Pizza Valley

1491
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,352
Second Tom Bombadil

1492
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
Where else you going to go for your Tom Bombadil

1493
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:36,544
The only knowledge B plan doesn't knowledge feit.com still not a real website

1494
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
Again nothing news

1495
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,296
Apple Store

1496
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:54,976
Is that a big successful company is crazy woman demographic

1497
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,280
Otherwise

1498
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
An Apple Store

1499
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:03,168
Meltdown we have a great country Sean Spicer says brushing Rob

1500
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,568
Country that allows you to end of that quote

1501
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,616
Insanely problematic

1502
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,896
As you brought up

1503
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
And I agree with you

1504
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,784
It only came out because she was kind of acting a little inappropriate as well

1505
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:23,136
So there aren't really out there

1506
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:26,464
If I saw Sean Spicer I would just

1507
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,488
Start barking at

1508
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,768
Uncontrolled

1509
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:33,632
As we've seen from my previous Behavior Infowars

1510
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
Begin

1511
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,192
Sing like a f***

1512
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,984
Yeah I would

1513
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
I think if I

1514
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,896
All of you

1515
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,224
If you want to yell at Sean Spicer in public

1516
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,504
I want you to know

1517
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
That I will provide no monetary assistance but I will

1518
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Be very supportive

1519
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,440
I legitimately had this thought recently if I saw Alex Jones

1520
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
I might throw up

1521
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:03,072
And not from discussed I might just get so like

1522
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,984
Strfkr

1523
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,104
Hahaha

1524
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,152
You know what I mean

1525
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,456
Like almost kind of think he's a hologram

1526
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,992
He's so insane

1527
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,528
He lies all the time

1528
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,088
He has Empire that's built on

1529
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,624
I don't even know what

1530
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,648
If it's okay

1531
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,672
Here's

1532
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
A conspiracy theory

1533
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
I love it

1534
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
Okay there we go

1535
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
You are trying to

1536
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,120
Your AI

1537
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
Is Varian

1538
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
Alright

1539
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
So you wanted

1540
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,152
So that means

1541
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
You have to get it real

1542
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Okay

1543
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,016
You get this

1544
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,320
To put up work

1545
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
Donatello

1546
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
You hiring

1547
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Beryllium

1548
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
To read those words off the

1549
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,792
It don't matter what they may be

1550
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
Refined

1551
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
It's message

1552
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,960
Until it be

1553
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Becomes

1554
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,496
Self-aware

1555
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264
Okay

1556
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,824
It Takes Over The Host

1557
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,384
Really an actor

1558
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,064
Note Alex Jones is this a plot of a movie cuz you're sounding like Alex Jones

1559
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,624
Mockingbird

1560
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:36,256
Anyway we're about to get into

1561
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,584
Nintendo and it made no sense

1562
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:52,128
Wants she wants to go out

1563
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,456
Demographic

1564
01:29:55,712 --> 01:30:00,832
What bar in the new form of dominance she's going to go further

1565
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,880
Press secretary and show

1566
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:06,720
The white

1567
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,680
Dramatic misinterpretation of the Indian caste system

1568
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,800
Not at all Alex Jones knows nothing about Brahman

1569
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,848
And The Untouchables

1570
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,896
Yeah yeah come on Alex

1571
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,944
Has nothing to do with right

1572
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:32,320
But also Alex is going to towards the end of this make the argument that he's not racist

1573
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
It's not like that when all he's done is Define her as an Indian person

1574
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,280
Tons of money so that's totally cool

1575
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
And your award

1576
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:51,520
Your woman who makes tons of money and you got to go f****** find this white guy to be dominant over cuz it's not enough for you to be in a really

1577
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:57,920
Well-to-do class the white male understand that every single word that's coming out of your mouth

1578
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,248
Reasons to ship it's the most racist you can be towards Indians

1579
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,808
I think I could do better

1580
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,904
I got a buddy growing maybe in Palatka

1581
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:13,024
I had a buddy grown-up doctor gums and

1582
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:19,680
He's a good man to the doctor from our previous episodes he probably could

1583
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
Teach you how to be Ray start working on some supplements for us

1584
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,056
Selma

1585
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,920
Go and show him in a ritual

1586
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
Submitter

1587
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,000
About your country

1588
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,072
You kind of drinks be calling people racist is magical

1589
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:50,656
Eat that speed the sort of under the underpinning of what he say

1590
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:54,496
That mean words like the worst thing you can call wife

1591
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,128
Do you get whatever you want

1592
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,152
That sort of his

1593
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,176
His belief

1594
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
People who

1595
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,088
Cold really racist beliefs

1596
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,136
Could possibly believe that

1597
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:16,000
Those people who believe that are the ones who react the most negatively towards

1598
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,024
Call the races

1599
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,072
If you are

1600
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,096
Call the racist

1601
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,120
We would stop

1602
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,936
Think really hard

1603
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,008
And it be like oh maybe I am

1604
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't think I am

1605
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,640
And then and then be like

1606
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,992
I think I might be right I would respond exactly the same way I do and I get any criticism

1607
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Which is

1608
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:42,624
First of all believe

1609
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
Yeah assess those Pila

1610
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,208
Come to the conclusion

1611
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:52,864
And that no matter what feel bad about it later like

1612
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,728
I'm still going to dwell on it later but I will know that I'm right

1613
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,776
Cuz you don't want to make somebody feel like

1614
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,568
Felt like you were raised out

1615
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,712
Self-aware enough into the universe enough to know

1616
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
That might

1617
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,272
Experience of life is subject

1618
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,344
I'm so I'm not always right

1619
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,440
All of the information I have at my disposal sometimes can't be enough information

1620
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:21,024
Your true whatever I'm experiencing isn't what someone else is experiencing

1621
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,328
And if I do something f***** up by accident

1622
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:27,424
Whatever the experience is real live in four dimensions

1623
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,008
Forget about the dementia

1624
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,640
Super

1625
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,664
Jhene Aiko

1626
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
The twelfth dimension

1627
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
Alex Jones

1628
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,528
Genius

1629
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,648
Minut

1630
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,024
Look at the Colts

1631
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,120
Cricket

1632
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
And it's basically spread its legs for you and you can run up and hand because we have no

1633
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,432
It's not all of it

1634
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,480
Navigate.

1635
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,696
Fundamental

1636
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
He doesn't get it but it is

1637
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:31,424
Actually love this

1638
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:41,408
Of the highest-paid group Americans

1639
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,968
And then you're bitching

1640
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:49,600
Who's the most successful thousand dollars a year

1641
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:56,000

1642
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,312
Call

1643
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:14,688
Any other group we've got the European American League final final statistics

1644
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,736
Vintage 26000 dollars

1645
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,576
He's showing this grass on screen it's a $76,000

1646
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,440
About 15

1647
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Yeah

1648
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,864
I just want to hear that I don't think I can do that precisely enough

1649
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,168
Only way I'm going to fall asleep

1650
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,216
It's the only way I can

1651
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:39,520
Sure

1652
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:45,920
That's how the reality pression of a screaming Indian lady

1653
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,736
Arnold Schwarzenegger

1654
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,040
Yeah

1655
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,696
It's just words it's difficult for us to

1656
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,512
Decide how to approach test

1657
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,816
I don't know

1658
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,936
Letter is it for anybody

1659
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,752
Who hears that

1660
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:11,776
Will be like

1661
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:16,384
A really f***** up things at the

1662
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,944
We asked

1663
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,248
How that makes them feel

1664
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
I think that'd be a good idea

1665
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,320
He's got to be in bed by now

1666
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
Just ask

1667
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,880
Somehow they feel and then we'll think about

1668
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
For him

1669
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,440
Cuz there's no way that I can

1670
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,488
Informed opinion with my life experience

1671
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,512
On what the fuc

1672
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,304
She sang and how other people would react to it

1673
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
Dr. gums

1674
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
He's probably high right now

1675
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,216
Is all Indians are always high

1676
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:47,104
Well because

1677
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:48,640
20

1678
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:52,224
I wish I made $26,000

1679
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
Alex Alex Alex

1680
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Alex

1681
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
Anyway

1682
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,392
This next part that he gets

1683
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,928
2 is where he predicts

1684
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,720
How people are going to respond to what

1685
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,072
Not at all like what we just

1686
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,352
Be like you

1687
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,120
He's probably going to

1688
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
Yeah

1689
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,216
That distorts American Jamie surveillance several others

1690
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,800
Crap

1691
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
Bruce Bruce

1692
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:35,232
Basically saying there is white people are susceptible to Big groups

1693
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,256
Does marauding foreigners

1694
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,656
Cars that come in

1695
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,448
White people have never

1696
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,728
Experienced that feeling

1697
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,032
Silly socks

1698
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:53,920
What do you mean you're offended we live in this upper world

1699
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
Where we don't have to

1700
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:57,248
To deal with these issues of tribalism

1701
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,064
Etiquette everyone

1702
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,600
That sentence

1703
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,160
Has white supremacist

1704
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:08,000
Yeah he's not literally saying that whites are better than other people

1705
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,816
But that is the undercurrent of what you think

1706
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:15,936
No I don't want people are literally

1707
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:22,592
To complain when a commenter on the a.v. club

1708
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
White people are better than

1709
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,456
Like I never literally said that

1710
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,016
But there's no other way to

1711
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
So if you take

1712
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Words

1713
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
It's having me

1714
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
It's really important

1715
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,952
That the words we say

1716
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:40,512
Communicate a feeling or an idea

1717
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
If those words

1718
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,168
He's a white supremacist

1719
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,728
So he's only defenses then

1720
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,776
Those words don't mean what I say

1721
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,848
What they mean

1722
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,640
Michelle Obama is a man

1723
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,176
Claims

1724
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,480
Times-News very serious he was just joking

1725
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,296
So I mean maybe he could come double back and be like

1726
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,576
I was joking

1727
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:07,136
I was joking about these Indians

1728
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
He could do that

1729
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Alright

1730
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,488
The other calendar

1731
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:14,048

1732
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Okay I will

1733
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,120

I miss times like this is ready

1736
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
Dictionary

1737
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,504
JWoww husband in radical islamists

1738
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,024
In fact he specifically invited her to go

1739
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,840
Do not do that at all

1740
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,168
Please do that

1741
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
Negative

1742
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:57,312
He is correct in the sense that people will take him out of context

1743
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:59,104
Text to make him look sensational

1744
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
I mean

1745
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,944
What are you saying is off

1746
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Anthem

1747
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
It's it's

1748
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832

1749
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,648
Directly next clip where he get

1750
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,672
A phone call

1754
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,584
Okay

1755
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,376
Really just his way of be

1756
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,936
He's just trying to impress

1757
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,240
So this is a this is another I love

1758
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,776
I think this is a prank

1759
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,104
I think it's

1760
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,640
Is it Rainbow Brite

1761
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:35,456
No rain

1762
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,296
Lesbian radical islamists

1763
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,856

1764
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:45,696

Missed calls

1768
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:18,464
Ustick Norfolk off phone calls

1769
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:27,168
I don't need the present call me to be successful

1770
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,776
Operation to listeners that love freedom

1771
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,080
What is an extension of our success

1772
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,640
Just like you told me

1773
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,608
What voice is that I don't know I don't know

1774
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,912
I don't know

1775
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
I don't know

1776
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:06,848
Call the president

1777
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:12,224
If it's from a certain area code on a cell phone

1778
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,552
Save contacts and I'm sure one of those contacts is definitely not

1779
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
President Trump with

1780
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
6 Hearts around it

1781
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,672
Yeah he pretends

1782
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,976
Miss 10 to 15 calls from the Press

1783
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:28,096
I need the president to call me to be validated

1784
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:31,680
He kind of talks about Trump and his like Trump as a product of us

1785
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
He's like

1786
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,752
I don't need to be congratulated by drop

1787
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,128
Not how it is with him

1788
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,664
He's trying to

1789
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,200
To say that Trump both

1790
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:45,248
Desperately wants and needs him

1791
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,296
And then also trying to

1792
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
Give excuses

1793
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
Sims 4

1794
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,112
He doesn't actually talk

1795
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,280
Sure Trump loves him so much but that's why he can pick up the phone

1796
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
And say

1797
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
Hey I'm on air brother

1798
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
You never

1799
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,168
Seen his schedule ever

1800
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,448
It's like a long

1801
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:10,336
Since relationship that has gone South and trying to pretend that the other one is still in love with them

1802
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
They're clearly cheetah

1803
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,896
Another

1804
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
Is cheating with other

1805
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
Michael Savage

1806
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,760
Probably just Banning

1807
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:23,136
Probably just told you was talking about going to a dinner with Trump

1808
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,696
Did Alex get really jealous

1809
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:31,328
You could he tell me that he gave a little bit of a

1810
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,888
This chair like a little bit like a little precum

1811
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,496
But that might have been the super male Vitality it's hard to sell

1812
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,056
You're always

1813
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,576
And

1814
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,856
People he's weather like

1815
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,928
Don't bother he goes up in the Trump is like

1816
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,464
Hey it's Michael Savage

1817
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,000
The reason I got elected

1818
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:04,096
So Michael Savage's also making a b******* stories about Trump

1819
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:07,168
I don't know if it's b*******

1820
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:11,008
I don't know.

1821
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,568
So we have one more clip

1822
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,616
That I'm going to

1823
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,640
Play

1824
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:18,176
Lafayette

1825
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
I have a call

1826
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,016
At the end of the show Alex take a call

1827
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:26,624
It's a great example of one of Alex Jones is called

1828
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,416
Yep isn't about anyting

1829
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,696
But he tries to make it about some

1830
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,000
I wanted

1831
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,304
Got a real boner going

1832
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,608
44 Wikipedia

1833
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:41,216
He doesn't like Wikipedia

1834
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,240
Pictures

1835
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,312
He has a boner for WikiLeaks

1836
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
Emperor Julian

1837
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,920
I thought that I would play the audio of a super clip

1838
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,736
This is just edited down of

1839
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
3 hours

1840
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
Broadcast

1841
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,832
The night that Julian Assange

1842
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,880
Announce that he was going to have a Prescott

1843
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,184
I like 3 in the morning

1844
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
Because he's in London

1845
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:06,816
And Alex

1846
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:07,840
Summit

1847
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,680
But he

1848
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,960
He announced

1849
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,496
But he was going to have his press conference

1850
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,544
And Infowars started reporting

1851
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,336
But it was going to be the big

1852
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,872
Mic drop on Hillary

1853
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,944
Ruin Hillary's career

1854
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
Julian Assange

1855
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:26,784
You say that

1856
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:30,880
Just being

1857
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,696
Got f******

1858
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Urea

1859
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
At him

1860
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
Abyss

1861
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,792
Clip is so funny

1862
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:44,192
It's so awesome and this is just a little bonus I took this from YouTube

1863
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:48,032
You should attribute your sources

1864
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:52,896
I can't because of the soros-funded operation

1865
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,432
But

1866
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,456
I watched

1867
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,016
Global I watched this three hours

1868
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,576
And there's only one thing missing from it

1869
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,600
And it's Alex Jones

1870
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,136
Swearing to do war on

1871
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:05,440
Julian Assange

1872
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,720
Yeah

1873
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:11,328
Where did the clip start at the beginning of the press conference

1874
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
Here's Hotel

1875
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:22,592
Hero Julian Assange

1876
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,856
She's up on the street

1877
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,160
The Flash up on the screen

1878
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,184
One hour later

1879
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,968
Shaq's

1880
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,760
Just like his

1881
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,064
Maybe he's a Boston guy

1882
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
And

1883
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,888
Tonight

1884
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:28,128
Closet

1885
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,352
We got was some weird

1886
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,800
Signs.

1887
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:03,200
This is this is a joke

1888
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,904
The world

1889
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,696
Is it Hillary butt plug

1890
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:22,144
12 hours are you're done

1891
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:34,176
Man

1892
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:43,648
Threatened

1893
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:47,232
433

1894
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:50,304
Chump us

1895
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,608
The last

1896
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,704
That is

1897
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:02,336
Exactly how an alcoholic sounds like throughout the drinking

1898
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,128
I don't even watch this

1899
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,152
Look I love

1900
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:08,736
Outside

1901
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,272
Pictures of

1902
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,600
Yells at me whenever I leave

1903
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,976
You know I'm not always nice

1904
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,256
Do you know I have a lot of emojis

1905
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
He was a pro

1906
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,424
The wrestler though so I

1907
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:33,056
He didn't understand kayfabe but like yet

1908
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,640
But that's I just love that cuz idealist rates first of all.

1909
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,664
Aulani

1910
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Does Beck

1911
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:43,808
Who's the

1912
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,344
Is all over the place Smith

1913
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
He changed his opinions on things

1914
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,416
Sofa

1915
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,720
Fast with no consistency

1916
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,000
He is a man without Prince

1917
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,280
Other than

1918
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,816
Whatever

1919
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:57,888
Whatever Trump wants

1920
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,912
That's a really interesting

1921
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
Point

1922
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,728
How we have talked about him

1923
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,496
M4

1924
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,848
Like 50 or so

1925
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,872
Know what he believed

1926
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:11,712
He still don't know what he believed other than global

1927
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
Prosperity

1928
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,784
Does he do Renaissance

1929
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
Definitely not

1930
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:27,072
He says he believes we're finding in his own behaviors

1931
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
Is that he believes in

1932
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:33,216
He just goes he just goes wherever

1933
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,032
To say that

1934
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,336
It's like there's there's one thing that I do

1935
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Find

1936
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:39,872
Really

1937
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,664
Which is that he doesn't

1938
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,968
Give a s*** about prevailing

1939
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,296
As opposed to men

1940
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,392
Even even

1941
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,208
The way the wind blows

1942
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,256
He doesn't seem to give a s***

1943
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
He just goes wherever his

1944
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
Brain

1945
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,096
Takes up his brain is wrong

1946
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:13,920
Contradict other things but those don't matter because he was

1947
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:17,248
He's also right now but that might be indicative of like a

1948
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,016
Deep

1949
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,552
Deep paranoid psychosis

1950
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,136
I mean it's hard to argue anything other than that

1951
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:28,000
Narcissistic personality disorder likes

1952
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Any

1953
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,792
Perceived

1954
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:35,680
In the same way in the same way

1955
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,984
Alec Baldwin's impersonation

1956
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,800
Alex Jones loses his

1957
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
Mentioned

1958
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,872
Impersonation

1959
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Not even involved

1960
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:46,944
Like and it's just

1961
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,504
Throwaway line just like hey Alex Jones

1962
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
Sunset this

1963
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,600
Reference with no context for Alex

1964
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,672
The people who watched

1965
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,208
Had no idea

1966
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:02,816
Who Alex Jones is no but that works into his argument a little bit more than you'd like

1967
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:07,424
Because he would say that the audience doesn't know who he is but they're going to

1968
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,240
So that's

1969
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
Stretch

1970
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:13,056
Was the powers-that-be the global

1971
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:16,384
Planting a seed in people's mind that he's a racist

1972
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,224
So once he becomes even more popular than he is now

1973
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,272
All these dumb down lemmings

1974
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,296
Like you and I

1975
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:27,648
Will think he's a racist I shouldn't watch his super relevant show

1976
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,208
That's what he would say

1977
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,768
Because I know

1978
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,376
Angles on to what his mind

1979
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,936
Everything is

1980
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,728
It's everything

1981
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,288
Direct

1982
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,336
That's just as possible

1983
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,640
Also big news I freed a giant bird

1984
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,664
Zelda

1985
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:57,600
Let's get together at last clip

1986
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,648
But I wanted to illustrate what

1987
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,184
Some of the phone calls are like

1988
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:07,328
On his show

1989
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:14,496
I love you a lot of them don't make sense at all and Alex is pushing an agenda

1990
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,288
This one is

1991
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,824
Perfect.

1992
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,384
Yeah but first he has to complain about pedophile

1993
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,152
And

1994
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:21,920
Lie about

1995
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:29,344
And and you heard Sabbath talk about a bunch of pedophiles running there

1996
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,744
Is run by pedophile so is you at it's a fact

1997
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:56,736
That's not true multiple videos on his YouTube channel

1998
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:01,600
Right around the time that guy showed up there with a gun

1999
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:07,488
His argument about a pizza place

2000
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,024
Dishonest to his own path

2001
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,584
The actual reality

2002
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
I've been on

2003
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,632
Conspiracy

2004
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:14,400
Roblox

2005
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,680
Conspiracy message boards

2006
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,728
I work on those places cuz I like

2007
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,544
Keep my eyes on what's going on

2008
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,664
I'm internet back

2009
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:35,392
Pizzagate develop from day one into what it is now and I watched it in the entire time it was

2010
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:36,416
These researchers

2011
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,696
Quotes

2012
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:41,024
About the pizza place

2013
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:44,352
It was about the pizza place for months

2014
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,888
Until they realize

2015
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,424
There is no legs here

2016
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,472
And then they try to repackage it

2017
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:52,544
Spin it if you like no visits about pedophiles in

2018
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,080
General

2019
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,640
Everyone tries to think that we're just talkin about

2020
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,920
Play

2021
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,688
Bulshit

2022
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,224
Straight b*******

2023

2024

They were dachshund people

2025
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
They were

2026
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,600
Glycol digging into

2027
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,648
Tax information

2028
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,184
And property deed

2029
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,720
Real place

2030
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:14,304
And adjacent properties and stuff like that

2031
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:19,936
Not okay they were taking three they were taking pictures of

2032
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,264
Surrounding areas and trying to figure out where building

2033
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,032
Things were like

2034
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,848
Spatially orienting stuff he was

2035
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,176
It was all about that

2036
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,456
Acclaimed

2037
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:33,760
Journey that led to John podesta's house

2038

And all this s***

2039
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,552
It was insane

2040
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,088
It was not the media

2041
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,648
That was crazy weirdos on

2042
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,672

Conspiracy basketballs that I don't want a name

2046
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,536
Yeah because

2047
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,304
They don't deserve

Are committing crime

2056
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:09,344
My dachshund East

01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,960
To never say that blacks are in

2066
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,496
Terrier always

2067
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,288
Yeah

2068
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,056
The cunning

2069
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,848
He knows the line of slander

2070
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,664
Out-and-out

2071
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:35,200
That's all you can say

2072
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,992
I'm not playing with you

2073
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:41,088
Fart

2074
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,112
Ecare

2075
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:42,880
You can't go back

2076
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,648
What you mean

2077
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,208
I mean the pizza GameStop

2078
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,744
Clearly bid

2079
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,768
Huge driver

2080
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:52,352
Videos

2081
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,168
And then he insist can't prove it either way

2082
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,704
Hebrew

2083
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,264
Didn't do all that

2084
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:08,736
Staying you didn't put out Loose Change and multiple things in Loose Change been proven to be absolutely

2085
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,808
So they just added it out replace it with me

2086
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,392
He doesn't have any integrity

2087
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:23,584
Is the stories like that basketball team

2088
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:28,704
American flag and that's what I'm most interested in these little tiny examples of

2089
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Urine out

2090
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,264
Outlier

2091
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
These two Wiggly

2092
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,384
You can always say like I didn't say that about the pizza bites

2093
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:39,712
The videos I don't know how to find them now

2094
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,760
Because

2095
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,040
Nobody's going to look for

2096
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:46,112
Where is the big stuff

2097
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,440
And then rewrite history when every needs

2098
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,464
Goes back to

2099
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,744
The big lie is always

2100
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Easier to pull off

2101
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,584
Yeah unfortunately

2102
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
Alex

2103
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:00,704
You now have a guy at least one of them in Chicago

2104
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,008
Who's keeping an eye on your tiny little eyes

2105
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:07,616
They are adding up really kind of

2106
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,968
I guess the point of why you always do this

2107
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:12,736
Is that

2108
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:14,784
Everybody else grabs

2109
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,808
And all that stuff

2110
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,088
And he can always win

2111
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:24,512
I think he could make an argument about anything we talked about

2112
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:25,536
Do you think so

2113
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:26,560
Probably

2114
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,352
There's no Highway

2115
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,912
There's no depth

2116
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:33,216
Two hour-long episodes

2117
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,752
Tight 35 minutes

2118
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
Nothing but

2119
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
No hilarity

2120
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
No joke

2121
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,664
Cuz we know we can't take a joke so it's

2122
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:46,784
Cure cut off our ear to fight our face or whatever

2123
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:49,856
I've got this version of Fire

2124
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,880
Exactly

2125
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,440
Let me quote Trump a fire

2126
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:55,744
Let's get into this phone call

2127
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,768
I don't like you quote

2128
01:58:57,024 --> 01:58:57,536
Trump

2129
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
Which means

2130
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,864
You're busted let me quote Trump

2131
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,472
Trump

2132
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:07,520
Check this out

2133
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:11,360
Things about the

2134
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,408
But

2135
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,200
It is

2136
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:35,680
Let's go ahead and talk to Amy

2137
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,288
Hi Alex going to be here

2138
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,080
It's the same lady

2139
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,896
I was just recently contacted

2140
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,200
Via phone

2141
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:50,528
You're saying this is the lady from Mario throw

2142
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:53,088
It does have a similar voice

2143
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,904
But she has a much longer called

2144
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:01,280
I don't remember what the call was that we took that

2145
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:05,376
Doesn't matter we do a survey

2146
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,704
Over vaccinations from the CDC

2147
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:23,040
So this is where Alex

2148
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:26,368
Those were Alex's narrative jumps off which is

2149
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:28,416
Be afraid of the CDC

2150
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,488
And also implicitly vaccinations are terrible

2151
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:33,536
Yeah so that what

2152
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,072
I don't I don't know if it's

2153
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:39,168
If the CDC calls to who

2154
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:51,456
From the CDC if it's not one of my friends who's calling me I'm not answering. I just don't have

2155
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:54,784
Time for phone calls

2156
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:03,232
That will disrupt

2157
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,512
What like

2158
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:07,072
Not if it's not in my contacts

2159
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,400
If it's frozen

2160
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,192
There's no way you would

2161
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,216
This is

2162
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:16,544
Call people

2163
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,872
Is there a Kohl Center where there's a bunch of people to

2164
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,896
Just hanging around like

2165
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,944
There's an emergency

2166
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:23,968
Call people

2167
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,760
And there's 20 guys

2168
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,296
You're asking the right

2169
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:33,440
Is there a phone

2170
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:35,488
Do you call a friend and then he calls to

2171
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,256
Two friends

2172
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,280
He calls to friends

2173
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,096
You just go from there

2174
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:42,400
Basically

2175
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:44,192
You're asking the right question

2176
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:47,008
I would like for you to watch how this call developed

2177
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,568
Because it is

2178
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:54,176
Uncle

2179
02:01:55,968 --> 02:02:02,112
And I should have but I entertained the conversation

2180
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:05,184
With a lot of forceful question

2181
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:08,000
Forceful question hasn't

2182
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,912
Honestly my kids are

2183
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:21,824
Up-to-date on their vaccinations it wasn't until within the last few months

2184
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:23,872
I don't have leave research

2185
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:30,528
Uneducated Marcelo

2186
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,576
So I want to say

2187
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,392
This I've just been so good I'm a hundred percent

2188
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,440
Convinced based on how this ends up if it's

2189
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,464
Is not a fake phone call

2190
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,864
This is how it all plays out

2191
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,656
Just were keeping track of it

2192
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
Alex Jones

2193
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,704
Don't answer the call

2194
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,520
If the government calling you jumped

2195
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:54,848
If you get vaccines you're going to be in the database

2196
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:57,664
Real fear ship

2197
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
Seems you're also going to be

2198
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:00,480
No matter what

2199
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:07,392
I believe so

2200
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,352
We got a band political advertising

2201
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:19,424
Online

2202
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:25,824
They're calling us

2203
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,104
About what you're searching

2204
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:34,784
Back in

2205
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,280
Wanted to know where we live later if they could

2206
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,560
Get record

2207
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:49,376
On the doctors that they've had vaccinations.

2208
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:54,240
And How likely it will be that we you were going to get the fleabag

2209
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:55,776
+ 8

2210
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,312
PB vaccine

2211
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,920
This point it still seems to be all about vaccines

2212
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:05,760
It's about to take a turn

2213
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:09,344
I mean I guess this seems like a reasonable

2214
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,112
Phone call from this

2215
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,392
DC do they take

2216
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:17,792
Surveys within the realm of possible

2217
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,584
Child Protective Services

2218
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,400
Flu vaccine

2219
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,424
The HPV vaccine

2220
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:28,544
Even if you were just trying to get a sense of style like a

2221
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,080
Testicle analysis

2222
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:34,176
It seems like

2223
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,200
Information that you would

2224
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:38,016
At this point nothing

2225
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,552
Nobody stealing personal identity

2226
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,856
We're on the side of it

2227
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,136
Right now

2228
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:44,928
First of all this

2229
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:58,496
100%, up-to-date

2230
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:04,640
You know you're in good standing this is total social engineering

2231
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:08,224
Gardasil the flu shot

2232
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,272
They never guessed the flu shot

2233
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:16,672
No vaccine ever work

2234
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,720
Is there any vaccine that's ever been like

2235
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,192
That seems like a bad wrecks in the sheet

2236
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,728
Advertising

2237
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,008
Look side effects

2238
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,800
Of this vaccine

2239
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:33,568
Not help

2240
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:38,688
The first side effects

2241
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,224
But you're also going to be super cool

2242
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,552
I don't I don't know that

2243
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,368
Side effects of this vaccine

2244
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,392
The vaccine does not

2245
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:49,440
Is a sugar pill

2246
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:51,488
Yeah

2247
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,816
Syringes sugar internet

2248
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:55,840
Yeah

2249
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,400
Yeah that's that's insane

2250
02:05:58,656 --> 02:05:59,936
Gardasil does

2251
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,216
Effectively

2252
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:03,776
Inoculate you from genital warts

2253
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,152
There are side effects

2254
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,688
That is absolutely true

2255
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,992
Very important

2256
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,272
We can beat backstory

2257
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,136
Acceptable risk

2258
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,416
I'm not saying that I want you

2259
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,696
Forced to get it

2260
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,976
But you should be enough

2261
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,512
Everyone should have an option

2262
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:28,864
Cuz cervical cancer is bad even if you get particular side of

2263
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,144
You're helping

2264
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,424
Destroy the actual

2265
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:34,240
Sure like that kind of the bigger deal

2266
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,544
I get that it sucks

2267
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
If you get

2268
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,336
A side of

2269
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,128
The same thing like

2270
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,664
We keep going back through this

2271
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,944
I get that it's stuck

2272
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:45,504
Somebody got a side effect from

2273
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,272
From the polio

2274
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,624
If everybody

2275
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,648
Doesn't do it

2276
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:53,184
Send of disease itself

2277
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:54,464
Propagated

2278
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:57,024
Through you

2279
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,816
You are doing

2280
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:00,864
A public service

2281
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,144
By getting a vaccine

2282
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,424
Yeah and it's

2283
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,216
Absurd to say that they've never gotten

2284
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:07,008
The flu shot right

2285
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,080
Like statistically

2286
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,616
Payless people

2287
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:12,896
The shop

2288
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,176
Get

2289
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,200
A terrible flu

2290
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
I will say that

2291
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:20,576
I haven't for the last 2 years myself I did

2292
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:26,976
I did when I worked when I worked at Walgreens

2293
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:27,744
And I was there

2294
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,512
Alright

2295
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,560
Nothing happened

2296
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,352
Mildly sick

2297
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,120
For like

2298
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:34,912
6 hours then

2299
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,264
Also

2300
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,800
Really been sick at all

2301
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,200
How many vaccines

2302
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:53,344
When I was a kid

2303
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:56,160
I got all of the lead around

2304
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,768
Maybe that's why I haven't been

2305
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,072
I'm immune to all.

2306
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:05,888
So much

2307
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,984
Let's find random things to blame on his vaccines

2308
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:16,128
I've been teasing that there's a turn

2309
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:16,896
Going to come

2310
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:19,200
Keep teasing

2311
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:21,504
Community is true

2312
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,904
Artificially acquired immunity is a real science but there's a Great Dane

2313
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:35,072
Okay

2314
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:39,680
You got to watch

2315
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:43,264
From federal agencies

2316
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,336
Confirm your social security numbers and stuff

2317
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,200
That might be

2318
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:56,064
You don't want to be alone

2319
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:13,216
But but but

2320
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:19,616
They got a call up there to confirm other information with you like

2321
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:27,040
That's good advice they did and they have

2322
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,576
Chocolate

2323
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,976
Email

2324
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:39,840
Your articles and articles ever back stance to start people

2325
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:41,120
Wait

2326
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:43,936
Did she just say that they've restricted her ability to

2327
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:49,568
The email people send out emails about vaccines and Infowars articles

2328
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,944
Just restrict

2329
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:58,272
Emails by one guy you just

2330
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,832
Like your reaction to that Alex Jones

2331
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,856
Giving good advice

2332
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:08,256
Although the part about it being Marauders in the government who Trump

2333
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,536
Describe

2334
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,072
Describe what you think

2335
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:12,096
Predator

2336
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:12,864
In his mind

2337
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:15,168
Dreadlock the alien

2338
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:16,960
Dreadlock daily okay so we're going

2339
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,496
Classic Predator

2340
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,824
Are we talkin the original

2341
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,384
Very good

2342
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:36,672
Someone within the government but the idea that it is someone

2343
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:37,696
Who is

2344
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,232
Doing a Feeling

2345
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,768
It's official

2346
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:47,168
I was just totally right

2347
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:49,728
Blame the government and weavexx Intuit

2348
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,008
Which is where the call takes

2349
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,544
Just a bat

2350
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,848
Records from the CDC

2351
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:02,528
Don't take this caller is an unreliable narrator

2352
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,576
I don't know

2353
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:07,648
I think that someone got to Virginia

2354
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,928
Is that

2355
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,976
I think it's virtual boost

2356
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,512
I think

2357
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:15,072
Put someone got ahold of some information

2358
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:17,888
Confirm her children

2359
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,936
Smell

2360
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,472
Their children's records

2361
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:24,032
Some stuff like that was the way they Trojan Horse

2362
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:25,312
Her into giving

2363
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:28,384
Has nothing to do with the CDC being hacked

2364
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,432
With that

2365
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:31,200
She got

2366
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,736
She got robbed

2367
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:35,808
Insane read

2368
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:40,672
Totally right and totally wrong at the same time

2369
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:48,608
Excuse me

2370
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:53,984
They also censored my email

2371
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:56,288
They they said it completely down

2372
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:59,360
For 36 hours I was not able to get on

2373
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:12,672
Real phone calls real fake

2374
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:17,792
Gmail

2375
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:20,352
Watch you out Colin

2376
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:22,912
Check with the bank

2377
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:31,872
Going to tell you your government okay

2378
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:37,760
Location

2379
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:48,256
I did it just because it seemed too coincidental

2380
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:54,656
With my with my recent

2381
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,192
Probably on

2382
02:12:56,704 --> 02:13:01,056
Finding a data breach with a major back and more

2383
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:04,128
Stuff

2384
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,664
Yes yes

2385
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,712
No

2386
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:11,552
Haven't been by me

2387
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:21,280
You see

2388
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:26,144
Vaccines do they want to give you 100

2389
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,448
Part of that is because

2390
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:31,264
There are more diseases

2391
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:38,688
43 5X

2392
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:40,992
So

2393
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:45,856
Really got 43 other diseases

2394
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:52,256
It is so stupid you want to give kids now

2395
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:54,304
Child so many more people.

2396
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:56,864
It's

2397
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,168
It's using a statistic wrong

2398
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,728
The statistic is right there are more vaccine

2399
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:03,520
But the reason for it which is

2400
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:04,800
Really easy to surmise

2401
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:06,336
Is the science progressed

2402
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:09,152
Is it Medical Science gets more

2403
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:13,248
When Alex Jones is grandfather

2404
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:15,296
I think we all know what that mean

2405
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:18,112
Everyone was super healthy

2406
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:19,136
Super healthy

2407
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:21,952
Diseases diseases

2408
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:27,840
With a speech a little bit about vaccine

2409
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,008
Everybody's got to decide deshano

2410
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:39,104
They always say you should be arrested if you don't take vaccines you like it

2411
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,408
I've had the vaccine

2412
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:48,832
That it does not make any sense

2413
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:53,440
Are other people who haven't taken the backseat

2414
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,720
That's just how that work

2415
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,512
Logic

2416
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:57,792
Science math

2417
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:01,376
All the stuff that's just how all the stuff there are some people who

2418
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:02,656
I don't have access

2419
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:03,680
2 vaccine

2420
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,264
You do too

2421
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:13,152
Just because

2422
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,688
Have nothing to fear from your

2423
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:16,224
Potentially polio written

2424
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,784
Or whatever Reynolds like that

2425
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:19,552
Meme

2426
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:20,832
Hey it's cool

2427
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,392
Like you got the vaccine

2428
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:25,184
Okay

2429
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:26,976
Now

2430
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:28,768
Question

2431
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:29,792
Bright

2432
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:31,584
I'm listening

2433
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,656
Do we

2434
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,776
Have we considered this pause

2435
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:43,104
Globalist

2436
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,384
The fake vaccine

2437
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:48,480
I think that Alex says that they give the globalist like

2438
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,272
McLean vet

2439
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,552
Wichita

2440
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:54,880
That's true that's

2441
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:57,696
Great

2442
02:15:57,952 --> 02:15:59,488
I think

2443
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:03,584
Get the ones that don't have like the

2444
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,352
Cancer

2445
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:10,240
This this reminds me of

2446
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Where is like

2447
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,824
Everybody

2448
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:15,616
Should be vaccinate

2449
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:22,016
Maybe we'll just closed her eyes for a few years they all died out

2450
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:26,880
The issue is that a lot of diseases are communicable

2451
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:36,864
Tell me about that but like

2452
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:43,264
I've always been really frustrated by that argument of like the way you all are getting vaccinated

2453
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:48,128
Who cares your kids not going to get sick

2454
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:52,736
His work right but even Beyond viruses other sorts

2455
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:54,016
Oh thanks but like

2456
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,552
What you were saying

2457
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:56,576
Again

2458
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,880
The earlier was super important

2459
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,416
It's the idea that we can

2460
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:02,464
Get rid of these

2461
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,744
Things like Pollo

2462
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:06,304
We can just have them not be issues

2463
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,072
Because they are

2464
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,352
So bad

2465
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:11,424
Weave

2466
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,448
Do you understand

2467
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:15,776
Like it's hard to really process how amazing

2468
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:20,640
That is things tire pattern

2469
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:27,296
Event haven't always been a f******

2470
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:28,576
Destroying

2471
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:29,344
Reason that

2472
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,392
The Europeans

2473
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,672
Found it so easy

2474
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:33,952
Colonize America

2475
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:34,976
Was because

2476
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:36,256
Prior to us

2477
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,024
Getting

2478
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,560
There was a

2479
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,328
Disease

2480
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,608
Break among the Native Americans

2481
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:45,472
Millions upon Millions upon millions of native

2482
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,264
I'd died and

2483
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,568
Yeah

2484
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:50,592
For we got here

2485
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,384
Those exact

2486
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,664
Disease hadn't occurred

2487
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:55,968
We would not be

2488
02:17:56,480 --> 02:18:02,624
These very easily sussed out how dumb

2489
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,352
The same time it makes so much sense because human being

2490
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,120
You don't have

2491
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,144
Longman

2492
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:16,448
We can only process

2493
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:17,472
What's In Our Lifetime

2494
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:19,008
Which is a good wife

2495
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:21,056
Deregulating the stock market

2496
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,336
So much sense

2497
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:23,104
To so many

2498
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:25,152
Because when

2499
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,200
We were still in that

2500
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,992
Economic

2501
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,528
We were still in that

2502
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,320
With no

2503
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,928
So of course they would imagine

2504
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,720
Well things are perfect now

2505
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:40,256
So what we do

2506
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,024
As we change

2507
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:45,120
And they forget that the whole reason they had

2508
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,656
In the first place

2509
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:49,216
Was because of the very same s***

2510
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:53,824
Get the

2511
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,616
Is stupid because

2512
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,384
Attention

2513
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:57,408
They're not exist

2514
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,944
Finish up this clip

2515
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:01,248
I believe there's only a tiny bit left

2516
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:06,624
Causes the shingles

2517
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,928
The shingles vaccine

2518
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,232
Herpes simplex

2519
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:14,560
What

2520
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:18,144
What

2521
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:27,104
Did you take the shot yet last week

2522
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:39,136
Appreciate

2523
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,160
What the f***

2524
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,440
Oh yeah

2525
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:43,488
So

2526
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:47,840
Does the shingles vaccine is just herpes

2527
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:49,376
The shingles vaccine is just

2528
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:51,680
I don't know

2529
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:54,752
Is is this one looking to

2530
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:58,848
This is I did not read

2531
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,384
Is there a reason

2532
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:04,224
Scenic route

2533
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:08,576
Yeah I don't know about that but I do know that his dad might be attributing

2534
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,880
Correlation causation

2535
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:11,904
As is always

2536
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:17,280
All these old people all these old people I keep see after they get a shingles vaccine

2537
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:19,840
They might be 85

2538
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,888
Anytime

2539
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:24,448
Tells me

2540
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:25,984
People act crazy

2541
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,800
I want to lose my

2542
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:31,616
Just goes back to people not being able to understand

2543
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,408
You can't understand

2544
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:35,200
Like human beings can't do it

2545
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:37,248
No and coincidences are super terrifying

2546
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:38,272
Cuz they

2547
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:40,832
Like the

2548
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,976
The the thing that I always I always

2549
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:48,512
Like fixate on

2550
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:49,536
Is

2551
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:51,072
The old story of

2552
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,632
The

2553
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:54,400
The person

2554
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:55,680
Who is about to

2555
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:57,728
Are there old lamp

2556
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,360
The very moment they're about to call somebody to pick up the

2557
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
The phone and it's that person on

2558
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:11,808
Everyday 300 million people make

2559
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,368
Every day they pick up the phone

2560
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:17,184
According to the laws of

2561
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:18,976
That will happen

2562
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,280
Yeah it's going to happen

2563
02:21:21,536 --> 02:21:23,072
That is not to you to somebody

2564
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:25,632
Just because it feels like

2565
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:27,680
It feels like you've been chosen

2566
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:30,752
Statistical

2567
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,544

02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:48,928
What we can take away from this

2575
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:49,952
I think if we want to give

2576
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:50,720
Summation

2577
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:51,488

2578
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,048
Take a joke he's a liar liar

2579
02:21:54,560 --> 02:22:00,192
