T-shirt dance

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:18,176
Going on that was a very aggressive way to relieve done this show without a button-up shirt on

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,296
Let's not a little spoiler alert

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,072
That's okay in my room it's kind of warm because I put up

6
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Plastic over the

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
You have done a good job

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,032
Yes we talked about home insulation and Alex Jones

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824

This morning here at knowledge fight headquarters

14
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
Maybelline got into a fight this morning

00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
Alright Claude through by

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,984
I might have called her the c-word

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
I threw up a matter

18
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
It's one of those things

19
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
It's such a

20
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
To hassle to put this

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Jessica but don't want to do it again you're such a

22
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
I'm bad right when I wake up

00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
What time do discover

24
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,120
If your washing machine is not working properly and you wake up and it's that time

25
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Time of the morning

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
I will burn this

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Whole f****** place

28
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
Everything has got to go

29
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Disaster as we do all the time

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
Interpersonal connection

31
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
We might have to

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Yes I know a lot about Alex Jones special episodes

33
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328

00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
Thank you so much for saving us from the present

35
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
And this is in honor of him

36
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496

You can go to our website, appreciate it

41
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
I don't care if you just add an extra penny for like 4 months

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
For real

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Just allow it to hear that soundbite again I'm holding a hostage

44
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
It only comes out for globulin

45
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
But anyway

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
Tegan requested

47
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
That we go back

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
Was interested

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,648
Yes and so the theory was that if we go back to St Patrick's Day

50
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
We would be able to find drunk

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
It is even though he's well not Irish

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Wet vac

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
I started to listen to them

54
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
St patricks.day is episodes Cinco de Mayo

55
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
Interesting

56
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:34,528
Let's cancel the show let's just go through what holidays you think Alex

57
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
Arbor Day

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Saint Patrick's Day

59
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Going to be drunk

60
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
Noon Riley's Broadcasting 2:49

61
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
If we go back

62
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Can we look at

63
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
The day after

64
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
I think we have much better likelihood of hungover Alex

65
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,808
Usually esoteric Alex which room

66
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Great

67
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Sometimes

68
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Still drunk

69
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,000
There's a chance of that delightful 12 a.m. still drunk Alex

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
He instilled

71
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
So I went back to 2014

72
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
And we what we have here is the March 8th

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
18th episode

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
2014

75
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Gets into

76
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
Witnessing

77
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,015
Hungover man

78
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,855
As well we were discussing

79
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Stop does he do it

80
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,535
What was no recognition or Patrick's Day had come over when

81
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Space f****** Potato Famine pieces of s*** coming over in our country

82
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
First immigrants that the reason that we have these Muslims to begin with

83
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
What's the trouble

84
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,831
Little weird

85
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
A little weird

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
He's mad at 8

87
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Pacific

88
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Athlete

89
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351

Owner also of Midas resources gold sales

93
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Just a reminder

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
The Marriott become more and more relevant in the future

95
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
Maverick I'm sure there's no reason that you left

96
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
I just like to remind

97
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Everybody knows Dan

98
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:47,647
Does not leave things into these clips it's definitely has no purpose behind

99
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
And no live from Austin Texas Alex Jones

100
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Responsibility

101
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
LeBron James

102
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,527
I believe it

103
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
Actually dinosaur media

104
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Attorney

105
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Basically

106
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,559
Sports figures

107
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
Known as Ron Ron

108
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Because

109
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
Piranha

110
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
Hang out together constantly

111
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,159
Steven Price

112
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,423
Bullying enslavement and it's no longer free infected cost a lot more'n

113
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,103
If you're really feel

114
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
Really does he sign up for

115
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
LeBron James

116
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Literally

117
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
Literally

118
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Better than anybody else sign up for the Giants

119
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Obamacare

120
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,215
Today

121
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,823
That's it

122
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
Who thinks he's God and let me be clear

123
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,527
He plays it like three more times that's all

124
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
Further education from LeBron James

125
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Here's the reasons that you should

126
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
Sign up

127
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
You should go get signed up McDonald's commercial

128
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
I was waiting for those

129
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,127
Where was pretty girls

130
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
This clip isn't done

131
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
LeBron James

132
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
Sam's Club here is where his head goes

133
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
This is immediately after

134
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
Give babies acne

135
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,991
That would be a weird thing for Obama.

136
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Would be more honest peace there

137
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
If you watch the video his hair is

138
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,423
Wyoming all over the place he's screaming he's going in Real Performance mode

139
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,311
Not feel stuff

140
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:22,943
Kind of counteract that cocaine

141
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
Probably little hair of the dog on top of it if you want to talk about Obamacare in the

142
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
These shortcomings

143
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,207
Sound variance

144
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
I don't feel like you need

145
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
Need to jump all the way to

146
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
To be covered in blood by Satan because of abortions

147
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,399
The Killing black people vaccines and

148
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
Sure I feel like it's muddying the Waters of the debate

149
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,567
If you do a lot of people would say

150
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,943
You can't be like okay well yes

151
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
It does cover.

152
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Well yes it does

153
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Expand the number of people who will get help Ensure

154
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Which then of course will lower health

155
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
Cost for everyone

156
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
U-Pull-It people paying

157
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Health insurance

158
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Is a socialist

159
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
Idea so I'm sure that

160
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
What he's really trying to say

161
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
Is that we need a more aggressive approach

162
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
Why is it that only adding an extra 30 million

163
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
I'm still leaving

164
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Success

165
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,319
Perhaps what we should do is really Implement universal healthcare

166
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Bathe ourselves in children

167
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
I think one of those options

168
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Okay

169
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,999
So after this clip he loses the thread a little bit

170
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,119
LeBron James

171
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
Basically

172
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
This is like

173
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
You're in no shape to be on the radio

174
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
Healthcare.gov commercial

175
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,167
Very sad

176
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Special

177
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,671
Constantly

178
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,279
Reflected Glory of their president they're in charge and

179
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
They're the bosses in

180
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
About to do

181
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
I kind of long one

182
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,103
But just right there I wanted to take a second

183
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Universal axon like this is 2014

184
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Flash for two-and-a-half years

185
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
The idea of the reflected

186
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
Pride you have about your candidate being on the winning team doesn't look great

187
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
What's going on Eric Trump is the only person who can save the world

188
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,823
I never heard that before

189
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,711
All right.

190
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,391
On YouTube Mania Philly

191
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
We could be that could also be the new Miss the end there

192
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
I love to channel judge smails how about you I don't know what to say

193
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
Just got to be like

194
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
What the f*** is going on this show has started

195
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Weird things the problem there is

196
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
I doubt he still alive

197
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,119
I don't have no idea about Judge smile

198
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
From Caddyshack

199
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
Alex references him a bit weirdly

200
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,263
They look similar or at least Alex

201
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Will look like

202
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
It's possible

203
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
I honestly don't know what judge MI

204
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
I have no idea

205
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,455
I don't remember the exact

206
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
Alex Jones maybe like I watch to it

207
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
And I don't think I've watched

208
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Maybe I should go back

209
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
I don't have

210
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
It's pretty good but I don't have time

211
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm listening to Alex cut the clips

212
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
Got my ears open

213
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
Listen to this b*******

214
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Alex

215
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Heart open can't lose antlers

216
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
More or less

217
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Obamacare

218
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
Cloward and Piven mindset which discussed in the past

219
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
People don't remember

220
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,559
Well it was two University professors who had an idea

221
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
A system where everyone is

222
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
Constantly of all the social welfare programs

223
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Or available to them already

224
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Bright actors

225
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Millions

226
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Billions of dollars

227
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Food stamps assistance

228
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Housing credits

229
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
If it's available to people that they don't take

230
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
And would help people if they knew they were available

231
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,599
Ratso cloward and Piven is an idea that

232
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
These people had

233
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Hey you tell everyone what is available to them

234
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
They get all of the things that

235
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
But they are entitled to under these government

236
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
And in effect

237
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
The system because

238
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
It's not set up for people to

239
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
And which is why in the 90s

240
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
They did have a guy wearing a green call Everett

241
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,647
Yeah they're there their thought experiment their idea was not so much

242
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Actual

243
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Listen to crash the system as much

244
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Cuz it was

245
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
A way to get people to on

246
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Understand and realize

247
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
That there are

248
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
So many people

249
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Need help

250
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
Believes that Obamacare is

251
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
The Peace of this

252
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
And it's trying to crash Healthcare

253
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
In order to bring in socialism

254
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
Many ways

255
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Single-payer

256
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
Universal Health Care is

257
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
And in this next

258
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
Cliff

259
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Obamacare

260
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Cost will

261
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Mainly because when

262
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
We have a republic

263
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Looking president one of these

264
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Is that

265
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Executive branch has control over what subsidies

266
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Can and cannot be put

267
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,703
Together

268
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
If you don't advertise

269
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,663
Like perhaps if you coming to work louder

270
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
And when there are fewer people in an inch

271
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,271
Insurance market cost for the people who remain in

272
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Indian

273
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Market go up

274
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
What is

275
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
In a nutshell

276
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
A self-fulfilling prophecies and Alex Jones himself has helped

277
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:35,071
Bring about you are in the Obamacare market right now

278
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
Blame Alex

279
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
F******

280
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
And his ilk

281
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
News what happened

282
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Whenever you Underpants

283
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,127
Just take the rug out from under the idea well in the same way that and Bernie put this

284
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
Bernie Sanders America's

285
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Most popular

286
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
Politician currently

287
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
Put this perfectly in regards

288
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
It's to the GOP tax

289
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,695
Which they are going to destroy our revenues for the god

290
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,767
Then later on when revenues for the government

291
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Are so low they're going

292
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,631
Look at how high the deficit is we're going to need to cut

293
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Spending on this

294
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
What are they going to cut

295
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Spending on Medicare and

296
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Ultimately the Jeep

297
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Tax plan

298
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Is attack

299
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Obamacare

300
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Healthcare is

301
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Stack-On literally

302
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
Every program that helps

303
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Speedball

304
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
What is it not attack on Dam

305
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Lariche

306
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
The rich

307
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
I agree so Alex is talking about that sort of nightmare socialism

308
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Descend upon us

309
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Yes

310
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
I want you to try and think about whether this

311
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Literally any worse than

312
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
The reality in front of us

313
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
Socialism

314
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Dump trucks

315
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
Surviving off a little dribble they give you

316
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:16,703
So I'd like to compare that to the gig economy

317
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,311
What are you talkin about is he describing that as socialism

318
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah he's

319
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Conception is the

320
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
You give all your money to the government they give it back to you in

321
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Small kernels

322
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
I kind of

323
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
You know like that the reality that we live in now where companies are able to have people

324
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Haven

325
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Nothing in very weird busy

326
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Teen scams bright but they run I think that's probably worse

327
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Then whatever nightmare scenarios

328
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
He's depicting even his

329
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Worst-case

330
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Scenario isn't

331
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
It's on par with right now

332
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,271
Maybe better than what we have on tonight

333
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
Your worst case scenario

334
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,671
How the kind of b******* that we have

335
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
To drive for Uber and Lyft

336
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
The crazy ways that the companies

337
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Just take

338
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Take from them

339
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,703
Define workers as like contractors

340
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Employees

341
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,775
The problems that Alex

342
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Plaintiff

343
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,335
And it seems

344
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Because

345
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
Because they do that

346
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
They make more money

347
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
And our taxes

348
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Which

349
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
The Uber and Lyft drivers

350
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,879
Go towards subsidizing the healthcare that they have to also pay for

351
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,951
Like we are subsidizing

352
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
These companies

353
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
Who are keeping us from getting Healthcare

354
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
Because when he

355
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Fun lies about Obama

356
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Specific

357
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:57,055
And that kind of comes into it really Trace back to just like

358
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:00,895
This is not Obamacare this is business

359
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:05,247
Yeah this is this is business she's one of the issues with right

360
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
One of them

361
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,087
What is a couple lies

362
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Next clip

363
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
About Obama

364
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
Or let's

365
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Just called the Affordable Care

366
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Let's not play games

367
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
Healthcare was about $100 a month for somebody under 13

368
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
The past

369
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
$600

370
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
The average person

371
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,359
Unless you're 2611

372
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
One way or another

373
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
Was going out

374
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Conspiracy theory

375
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
It was

376
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
IRS website irs.gov

377
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
Wishmaster bank account

378
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
No it's

379
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Ludacris

380
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Complete abs

381
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Salute b*******

382
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Like

383
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
I feel

384
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
Sad for the people who believe

385
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
These sorts of things

386
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Look into it

387
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,768
The year 2017 so this is

388
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Three years after Alex's

389
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
The spelling of b*******

390
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Yeah like this

391
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,656
The penalty for not having Obama

392
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
Affordable Care Act insurance

393
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
Is 2.5% of your total household adjuster

394
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
The gross income

395
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
Or $695 per adult and

396
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
$347

397
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
A child

398
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Up to a maximum

399
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Of 2000

400
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
85

401
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,320
That is the maximum fine

402
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,160
There's literally no way to be 5000-10000 20,000

403
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
I can't afford it

404
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,864
So you got to pay 45% of your income to file taxes

405
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,728
Interesting also well the truth is they have reduced besides

406
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Is the IRS to the point where

407
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
And this should not be publicized

408
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
But

409
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,408
They just don't have enough people to actually audit

410
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
And

411
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
It's not it's not an actionable thing

412
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Trump has laid out

413
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
In terms of their priorities

414
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
If you just don't check the box

415
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,160
About your insurance

416
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
They don't

417
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Look into it they don't come after

418
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
Exempt

419
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
Built into the Affordable Care Act

420
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
About if it would be

421
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Be crippling

422
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
You don't have to pay the penalty

423
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
If

424
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,592
The most affordable coverage that is available in your area cost more than 8.1

425
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Percent of your house

426
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Household income

427
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
So that's one thing

428
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
Or if you are uninsured for less than

429
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
Consecutive

430
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Or if you're exempt

431
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
From filing a tax return because you're

432
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Income is too low

433
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,952
Or your religion objected to the use of insurance

434
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
That's even a f******

435
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Thing you could do you could claim

436
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
Do Christian Scientists don't have to

437
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
They're exempt for the pedal

438
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
From

439
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,984
Given too much credit

440
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
I'm sure but

441
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Why they pitch a fit if they weren't

442
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
Example.

443
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,176
I'm starting to think maybe religion

444
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:54,368
I also you're exempt from the fennel tea if you qualify for a hardship exemption do things like homeless

445
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
Miss bankruptcy eviction

446
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
Or any other of a list

447
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Trying circumstances

448
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Which involve poverty

449
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
If you are making under like a point where it would be

450
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,192
Devastating for you to have to pay a fine

451
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
For not joining the insurance Market you are the only people that makes a difference

452
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
Are people who

453
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:20,224
Really really should be in there

454
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,112
Poor person is going to be charged

455
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
$20,000

456
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,280
He's playing games this is for people like him the people who listen to

457
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Are the people who almost

458
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
The people in red states are already subsidized

459
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
More by wealthier Blues

460
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,568
Totally because they are tricked by these con men

461
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,640
And they are voting against their own interests

462
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
The same way they have done

463
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Since

464
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
All the time

465
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,784
The sad sad shell game

466
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
Being played in

467
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
They purport to be speaking in

468
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
In favor of

469
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,720
That is that is the system

470
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
That Alex is upholding

471
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Is bizarre stupid patriotism

472
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:10,912
Deconstructing a little later than episode

473
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
He's mad

474
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
And in his mind

475
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
Obama is a criminal

476
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Yes trying to pull off this

477
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
Criminal scam

478
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
All over the world

479
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Horrifying criminal scam of preventative medicine Limited

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
They don't get

486
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Trouble they don't get punished

487
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
But who does

488
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Well Alex

489
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Talk about 1

490
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,664
Kevin Trudeau

491
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,504
Starbucks

00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:35,648
I'm not support that means I'm not going to support

499
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
What is that mean I don't know what that means

500
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
The point is

501
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Just study the con

502
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
Prison

503
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
Superman

Got 31

506
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
What's going on here

507
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Daiquiri what is it

508
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,056
Infomercials

509
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,664
John's Wort good for depression

510
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
Honest he's good for

511
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,624
Discovered

512
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,288
Kevin Trudeau

513
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,664
Sogo glisten Obama aren't as bad as Kevin Trudeau

514
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,320
Just a deal with that thing to talk about at the end there I Kevin Trudeau had a website called meet Illuminati members

515
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Lowes.com

516
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,744
Where you could join up for $1,000 and he would introduce you to people in the Illuminati

517
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,328
$6 a month

518
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,888
I believe was my monthly

519
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
You keep up your Xs

520
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,472
And I'll be an Illuminati member

521
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:02,336
Torn between wanting to protect

522
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:05,152
Stupid people and wanting stupid people to get their comeuppance

523
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
That's just at the man that's a great

524
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
IQs of Nantes

525
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:13,088
You know you know that something is not true if you see through the b*******

526
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
And you want to

527
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
People like

528
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Use it

529
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
It's making people afraid of the globalist

530
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Was

531
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
A bit worse

532
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
In many ways

533
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,960
So what time

534
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
Weird bulshit

535
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Decatur bunch of books

536
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
They don't want

537
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
You to know Lex food secrets

538
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
And he made

539
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
A number of

540
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
Really really

541
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:47,648
How many vitamin C's only one of the things he also

542
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:53,280
The starbugs the graduation sun doesn't cause skin cancer so but what does sunscreen

543
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,840
So you should

544
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Perfect

545
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936

Super extreme sunburn

548
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
It was

549
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
One of the worst couple days

550
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,528
Is not being able to move

551
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,832
And just like biting a pillow cuz I was so much pain

552
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,904
Is terrible but you also encourages them occult

I'm gazing you invited me out on a float trip

554
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,632

Stolen polonium all over again I got too drunk too early

Do you get to

557
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,872
The more the more biographical.

558
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Details I get a

559

Advocated for just like folk remedies

562
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,136
And stuff like that

563
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Whatever

The miracle cure ulcers

569
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,640
Very bad people

570
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Reflux is a

571
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
The myth

572
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Can deal with it by

573
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Cider vinegar all the time

574
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
The whole bunch of claims that he's made over the years

575
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,232
And a lot of close to becoming l.ron Hubbard

576
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:30,048
Claims

577
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
Things are just not proven no backing

578
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
I'm sorry

579
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,960
So over the years

580
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
SEC and the FTC

581
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
Because he's making dangerous claims

582
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Lymphoma

583
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,408
Yeah he's hurting

584
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
Right cuz I got a lot of complaints

585
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,040
There's other complaints

586
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
Cheplics Loudoun court orders

587
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,928
To stop selling this stuff

588
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
I mean to

589
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
You got a multi-level marketing

590
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
I'm going with selling these products

591
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,632
People and have them sell to their friends

592
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,008
So over and over again that there is Avon for Pure milk or Infowars

593
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
He keeps being told

594
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Ensued

595
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
Any lawsuits

596
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
You can keep writing your book

597
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
And selling them

598
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Cuz that's free speech

599
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
We can't

600
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
Suppress that

601
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,392
But you're banned from making infomercials

602
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
Or selling your product

603
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,720
And he wouldn't listen

604
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,768
He just kept selling s***

605
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,888
We ended up getting food or I believe the damages that they they affected on him

606
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:42,752
Was 37.6 million dollars he had to pay a restitution

607
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Ford

608
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,616
Consistently defrauding people and you wouldn't pay it

609
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,992
Gizzy kept floating court orders

610
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
That's such a weird

611
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Okay

612
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
You can publish books

613
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Yeah

614
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Can't go auntie

615
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:08,096
What's the same thing that happened with Erwin ship

616
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:15,008
But because

617
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Profiting off the book

618
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Right

619
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
But be that as it may Trudeau is a guy with a

620
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
History

621
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
I'll just

622
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,784
Like real f*****-up crimes and scam

623
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Classic snake oil

624
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Yeah he's The Music Man

625
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
The monorail map

626
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:37,024
Kevin Trudeau poses a doctor in order to deposit $80,000 in false check

627
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Eddie 1991 pleaded guilty to Larson

628
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,704
Federal charges of credit card fraud after

629
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
Social Security numbers of 11

630
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Customers

631
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,568
Memory product that he was selling

632
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
And charge

633
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
120

634
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
2007

635
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
$135

636
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,200
58 cents on their credit card

637
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:02,112
He spent two years in federal prison because of the convection

638
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Balls later his interview he explained his crimes and quote youthful indiscretion

639
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
Here's the problem with catch-me-if-you-can

640
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:18,752
The wrong guy Leo was playing Kevin Trudeau I think we would all be honest

641
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:25,152
He said it wasn't as bad as everyone thinks

642
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,320
That's all I got to say I'm just I'm starting to like the bald-faced lies

643
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
It's like a man with way too much

644
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
I don't know why that should be illegal or anything like that

645
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,424
Cuz I thought you was a doctor

646
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,824
That was a simple misunderstanding because he jokingly refer to himself as a doctor in memory

647
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
Alright

648
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040
Regard I don't think

649
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,112
Bad guy here he also tried to

650
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,000
Cool a lead Kong International pool tour but because he was just

651
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,096
You know such a con man you didn't end up paying the people on the tour

652
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
I bet a job for a while there I was I was actually aware of

653
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
And plugged into some of the professional pool playing

654
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Community

655
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,688
I know some people

656
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,808
Interesting late like like the black widow I bet she got she got taken

657
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,928
Didn't buy that because of the disaster of it

658
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Because of like

659
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
The distinct that put on

660
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,352
Like fool as a national sports club in like bowling two certain

661
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
Poker caught on real hot

662
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:56,032
A good long while we didn't end up paying people

663
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Except like

664
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Reminder

665
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,224
Parts of what they were owed

666
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
National Poker Tour

667
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
But a professional pool competitions as a whole

668
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
As one commentator put it

669
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
Quote the pool Hustler wasn't murdered by any single suspect

670
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,584
But the last man holding the knife with Kevin Trudeau

671
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,936
You know what's so weird about that he could have been present

672
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,104
America eventually what did he do with literally any

673
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
Different route

674
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
It's f***** up is just worse

675
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
He would be depressed

676
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
Yeah they probably had access to like or didn't

677
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
We made some bad choices of lawyers

678
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,352
Hey if you are if you're trying to pull yourself up by the boo

679
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
By lying

680
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
If you're already rich

681
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,544
Your but also 37 points

682
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
Billion dollars is what he was supposed to pay and didn't

683
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
You got to consider that's not everything you made

684
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
How much do

685
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,784
I have no idea I have no idea I'm going to be a lot of

686
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,136
Stuff like that kind of like

687
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Weird cons

688
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
No

689
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,864
Cuz we ain't making s*** I know right if you think our main issue is morality no

690
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,192
Creativity

691
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
We could come up with all these talking households easily

692
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Abreva

693
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
What would we have what we have policy walks multi-level marketing

694
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Think about it

695
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,672
For $150 a month we will maybe send you a picture of Celine every now to be tough

696
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,536
Take pictures of her at least one of her tearing up last

697
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,888
Sounds good I just wanted to go into that cuz I was listening

698
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Text Kevin Trudeau

699
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
I didn't know so I looked into it

700
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Defending interesting

701
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
He wasn't

702
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,384
It doesn't doesn't gated like a guy who commits

703
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
Go to bed for seeing an event

704
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,272
Supported Trump seems interesting

705
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
And this together

706
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:20,928
Looks like he might have some of that history in his his own life

707
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
If you actually go to

708
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
I don't know if I have it pulled up

709
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
This might be a subject for another day

710
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,960
But I was reading a bunch of reviews of the Infowars

711
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
Which is the Infowars multi-level mark

712
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Nothing but complain

713
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
About like

714
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
They won't return product they won't allow you to send

715
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Think back

716
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
They overcharge you customer service

717
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:49,600
This is terrible at these people who are buying in bulk and selling to other people

718
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
You got to assume that

719
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Oh I wanted the reviews

720
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,720
It was very clear that like

721
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,768
They take down reviews

722
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
That's why they have such good reviews for all their products

723
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah I've had experience almost everybody doesn't like

724
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Hunter back to turn over

725
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Say loaded more about him

726
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
About their dinner

727
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
US Weekly

728
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,968
Putt-Putt Obama and Hillary Clinton prison

729
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,952
Abs

730
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
The Four Seasons

731
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
I mean

732
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
That's rude

733
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
Nothing compared to LeBron James

734
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
Rolling out

735
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
Amora

736
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
Michelle Obama Care

737
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
Emergency room Hospital

738
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,816
Most of which are hospitals

739
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
Caprice

740
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
Regular Hospital

741
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
Hippocratic Oath

742
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Call Allen

743
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
So what

744
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Actually advocating

745
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Is

746
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
Government subsidy of hospitals

747
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
Instead of government subsidy of insurance

748
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
Slightly problematic for his philosophy

749
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,072
Run

750
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
These hospitals

751
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Necessarily

752
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
If half of the shift they do is free

753
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Unless

754
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
The government's UPS

755
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah

756
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,800
Getting back to us fake pass

757
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,872
Right where where everybody does everything for free

758
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,456
Hospital

759
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,784
I would like to believe that they got rid of the Hippocratic Oath

760
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
I hear that all the time

761
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
I would like

762
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,952
Leave it at some point in history that's how eyesight operate

763
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
I think what he's talkin about is like mission

764
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Catholic Hospitals in

765
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:06,816
Stuff like that

766
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
They had

767
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,888
Standards that they put upon themselves

768
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
In terms of charity

769
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,032
More than welcome to do on their own

770
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,336
You can't force someone to do charity

771
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,408
Under Alex Jones's Prosperity libertarian

772
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
Right

773
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Somebody want

774
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
You would need government regulation

775
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Congratulation

776
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
I'm proud of you

777
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
You nailed it

778
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Kind of he got it

779
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
I think it would be a 20 your system

780
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
To have the hospital

781
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
How to take care of

782
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
Everybody have their own

783
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
Government-subsidized

784
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,424
Easier

785
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,520
It's freedom of going wherever you want

786
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,431
Do you know if you when you go to the hospital if you're in the hospital going to be free or not

787
00:41:54,687 --> 00:42:00,831
I think this is going to be a hookup and then

788
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Anyway with Deli

789
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,999
You show up you never know

790
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:08,767
Inefficiency

791
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,095
You could be operated off

792
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
That's nonsense

793
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
There's no way there be able

794
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
Uneven

795
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Even if

796
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,567
You would like every time we go through this though

797
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
There is that

798
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,895
There is going to be a fight

799
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
And it's going to

800
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Come from recipe

801
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,503
National Health Service

802
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
In Britain

803
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Has been

804
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
Because rich people don't

805
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
Want to

806
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
Right

807
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,535
When it comes in always comes back to

808
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
We need to

809
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
Behead rich people publicly

810
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
In front of children

811
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
I think that's what needs to happen

812
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
Navigate to drink

813
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:58,943
I guess I don't agree with you metaphorically

814
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
If you want to do something like a national health

815
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,063
You're going to wind up having it

816
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
And it's going to work

817
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,207
People are going to love it and then eventually the trick that's always going to be pulled is

818
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
Well it is working

819
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Sing well

820
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,535
Selecta Fonda

821
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
Work is well.

822
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,703
And so then you can say well you know what would work better

823
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,567
And then privatizing it happens if people go this doesn't work at all even though

824
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,711
Kind of idealistic

825
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
What's going on in the world

826
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,015
There's a lot of stuff that's half

827
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
And one of the things that's

828
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
Is that Russia is

829
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,647
Crimea

830
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Still alive

831
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Sure

832
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:47,071
And that's okay

833
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,167
Not Alex's that can always live forever

834
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,983
Alex

835
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
A little bit of steak

836
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Bathtubs

837
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Situation in Peru

838
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,943
Also we're going to get into

839
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
Is projecting weakness

840
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
Obama

841
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
They're not weak they're incredibly evil

842
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,119
Does Obama is just a figurehead

843
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,055
Global Empire

844
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,023
So what's going on in a little bit later

845
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
I think I'm running out

846
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
I think I'm running out of patience

847
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,775
Driving me insane

848
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
Kamiya is not

849
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
It's very much

850
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Before we go any further

851
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,735
From what I understand of that clip

852
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
He is saying that

853
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,063
The Israeli defense

854
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,927
Is saying that America and Obama are projecting weakness

855
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
For not intervening the Crimea

856
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,559
Alex's take on that

857
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Is that no

858
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Obama's in

859
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Instead promoting

860
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
Globalist

861
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
By not intervening

862
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,127
He later I'm almost there

863
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:42,527
Defend Russia Annex and crime does not understand that

864
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
By not intervening

865
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,391
Obama is not acting as a global defense

866
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
Annexing Crimea

867
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
Putin is making

868
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,839
Uce expanding your Empire sexy

869
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
Yankovic

870
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,143
Adjust flat

871
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,447
Back to Russia at this point

872
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,263
Write the way that Alex is presenting

873
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Is

874
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
Boettcher

875
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,383
Gourmia is going into Russia or being annexed by Russia

876
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
But Obama is managed

877
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
To take 98% of

878
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
The country

879
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
What to take

880
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Yeah let's get in

881
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:20,671
That I don't know if you fully spells that out but that's what he gets at

882
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Like the idea that they are for their strong

883
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
If they have the rest of Ukraine

884
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,351
It's weird it's weird

885
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,423
What's bet he doesn't get into it right away

886
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
Fake news

887
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
Before he does backs

888
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
The first piece

889
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
Just waiting gun store was fun

890
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,527
Infowars.com

891
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:51,391
He doesn't really cover it and all that much detail but if you go to infowars.com

892
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Find the article at

893
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
The quote that he's taking

894
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
Is

895
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
Basically

896
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
Fun paperwork is

897
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,119
That's a quote from the guy

898
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,215
Rating a gun stories

899
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Is exciting

900
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Sitting at a desk

901
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
Doing office work

902
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
That's not what you say

903
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:14,943
That's not anything about like I love grabbing guns

904
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
He's completely misrepresenting that even

905
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Even based on the article that's on

906
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Infowars

907
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,159
It's not what you saying just read the headline

908
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
Giving his own

909
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,535
Now that's

910
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
Editor-at-large

911
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
So you're another piece of that nonsense

912
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,519
Report

913
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:43,103
I told you it's a long time

914
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
It wasn't

915
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,223
I'm not imagining this

916
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Greece

917
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
Insofar as

918
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,183
But you are not imagining it and being right

919
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,279
Interesting way to parse

920
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Mostly and updating of the Telecom

921
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Medications active

922
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
1834 which wasn't updating

923
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
The

924
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
411

925
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
I don't know I don't think more than before

926
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:20,735
And the reason is because back then 30 whatever

927
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,271
Slightly different

928
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,831
Answer what it actually was was

929
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,623
About regulating

930
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
Monopolies

931
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
And that sort of thing

932
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Which is a good

933
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Instead

934
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
CeCe is allowing

935
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
People like this

936
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
Sinclair

937
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,495
Two outlets in small-town

938
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
But

939
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
Forcing people to get what is essentially

940
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,127
Media

941
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,455
And then eventually that it will all be owned by one group

942
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,527
Something that we all know is evil and yet

943
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
People are consistent

944
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Bentley voting

945
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Struggling

946
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
I love to be shy

947
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
Phone call

948
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
In the article.

949
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,103
Drudgereport.com

950
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
That should be the headline

951
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Headliner

952
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
The problem

953
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
Let's not

954
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,255
What what's going on

955
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Right

956
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
That is not

957
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
If you read the entire rod

958
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,447
Canton Post article

959
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,311
NPR article that goes into what's going on

960
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,455
The United States has the capability to record 100%

961
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Of

962
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
4 calls

963
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
This isn't

964
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
24in

965
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
This is in response to

966
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
To foreign countries

967
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,975
Is that have

968
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Interest

969
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Terrorism invest

970
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
It's

971
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,679
In terms of a technology

972
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
It's chilling

973
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Certainly

974
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,799
Yeah but also that goes into the

975
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
This article

976
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
Is that

977
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
They have the ability to

978
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,943
Record all of the

979
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Phone calls with Alexa

980
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Indonesia

981
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
Or something like that

982
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,367
Deployment collection system

983
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:37,183
The recording every single conversation Nationwide

984
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,487
Billions of a rolling buffer

985
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,303
The queers the oldest called as new ones arrive

986
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
According to a classified

987
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
Of this program

988
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
I called Mystic

989
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
It's messed up

990
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
I don't like it

991
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,775
But Alex is misrepresenting

992
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Even even William Bennett

993
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,407
Alex Jones is NSA whistleblower

994
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
It was saying

995
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,479
Recording 80%

996
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,759
All the phone calls which would be

997
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
Money but that's also not active

998
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,319
Based on information

999
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Come out

1000
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
I think I might

1001
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,135
Actually

1002
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Gree with Alex

1003
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Spirit

1004
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,767
Write-in lyrics letter absolutely not

1005
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Spirit

1006
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
The

1007
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,119
It is it is the absolute

1008
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Worst thing

1009
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
But it's

1010
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,495
Not any

1011
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,055
Indication that they're recording every American

1012
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,359
Phone call

1013
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,943
And they're not letting go of them 4:30

1014
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
The people that we know that they have

1015
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,599
NN the more reports we get out of

1016
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
Snowden revealed is that

1017
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
They are not

1018
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
I'm against

1019
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,231
But at the same time I don't like

1020
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
Sensationalize versions of it

1021
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
Cuz then you're not dealing with the reality

1022
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
We have Alex's version

1023
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
You're never going to

1024
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
The deal with the situation

1025
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Exit

1026
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
You're going to be having this

1027
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,079
Scary Boogeyman version of it that every single thing I do is being collected

1028
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
Good forever

1029
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,919
Stand up in it

1030
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,967
Orin reactionary violent reaction

1031
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,783
Okay neither of those is productive towards getting any

1032
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Anything done

1033
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
So that's why I even though I

1034
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
Have that capability

1035
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,463
It seems like a bad thing for us to have

1036
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,023
Developed at the same time

1037
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
To be honest

1038
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
Clear that he

1039
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
Keith Lyon

1040
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Yes

1041
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
Even even wrote an article about it around the same time

1042
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,103
Yes and they are like tamerlan Tsarnaev

1043
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,919
Boston bomber

1044
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,735
But she had a phone call to Chi

1045
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Was being asked

1046
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,599
About MSNBC

1047
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,415
Please have that phone call its

1048
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
Just a matter of whether she would

1049
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Agreed to discuss a tourist

1050
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
She's going to have to

1051
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Deal with it with

1052
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Operation

1053
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
And

1054
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
The reason that that's not

1055
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
Not as scary to me as like

1056
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
An idea like that

1057
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
And that's how it's being presented

1058
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
The reason it's not scary

1059
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
Cuz those dude we're under

1060
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:06,175
Sedation for quite a while they were on the FBI's radar

1061
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
There's a collection

1062
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
A phone call

1063
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Their Associates

1064
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
And things like that that's not

1065
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,855
That's not that surprising

1066
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Use of spyware

1067
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
And the fact that they bombed the f****** Marathon

1068
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
Is indication

1069
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
To me that

1070
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,375
But that line of Investigation is worthwhile

1071
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Yes

1072
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:32,031
I I don't know you know that's I think that leads us to a very interesting

1073
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Conversate

1074
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,847
In regards to

1075
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,967
Do you think it would be more effective

1076
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
To have

1077
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
This kind of got

1078
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,623
So there's a certain percentage of the population that is never going to respond to

1079
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Reasonable faith

1080
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Right

1081
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Do you think it would

1082
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
Be helpful

1083
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,511
Do you have a guy like Alex Jones

1084
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,303
Sensationalizing what is Anna

1085
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,143
In order to mobilize people who would otherwise

1086
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
Do you still be mobilized correct

1087
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:07,871
I don't think they could I don't think they could either

1088
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,199
Reasonable at like when you describe the reaction

1089
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
Is that these people will have two hits

1090
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Sectionalized

1091
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
You have the impotent

1092
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,343
Can you have the

1093
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
Violent over

1094
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
Half-cock

1095
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
The guy

1096
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Went to Comet Ping Pong

1097
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,423
So like

1098
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:38,079
The reaction that you're going to get realistically other than anti-semitic rants online

1099
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Yeah and people taking super male vitality and doing nothing

1100
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:45,247
Okay

1101
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
My next question

1102
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
You though is what is the reaction

1103
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
That people have

1104
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
The reasonable fat

1105
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Free question

1106
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
Which I feel right now is

1107
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Informed impotence

1108
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,815
Yeah Thursday

1109
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Not just

1110
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
JustBats

1111
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,263
Football people

1112
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,847
Lobby Congress

1113
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
Some Congress members have acted

1114
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
I need 2015 Obama.

1115
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
Stop the book collection of metadata

1116
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,831
People have rationally taken action

1117
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
And gotten a lot of this rolled back

1118
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:28,511
Not to what extent that actually rollback is almost impossible without

1119
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
But

1120
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:34,143
I mean we can't operate on hypothetical information that may or may not be true

1121
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:42,335
I don't know I mean that's that's why I asked you I feel like you took it a little bit defensively

1122
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,151
I didn't I just got excited by remembering that

1123
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
The year that yeah that's true

1124
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,343
No I sure exactly how it is that we should know about

1125
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:59,999
Because the other argument dysfunctional government but I mean the other argument against

1126
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,303
Is that because of that bulk collection

1127
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
We do have those recordings of the phone call

1128
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:06,911
All right

1129
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
Would it have been

1130
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
I feel like it would be more

1131
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:17,919
To reduce the signal-to-noise ratio which is something that we've I don't do it we've come under Fire for

1132
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
A million with

1133
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,527
Preventing 9/11 is that

1134
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
We have so many different

1135
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,647
Threats that were theoretically monitoring

1136
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,231
That you can't give any kind of credence to any one over another

1137
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:35,071
I don't disagree with that so it's hard it's hard for me to say

1138
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,143
What is what is the most effective situation

1139
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
And whether or not and Alex

1140
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Jones

1141
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,799
Disregard helpful or hurtful

1142
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,871
Situation

1143
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
Answer is

1144
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,431
I don't know how you would implement

1145
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,503
But I would imagine that's way to get around this

1146
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Is

1147
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Have

1148
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,647
A civilian board with confidential access

1149
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
Whatever

1150
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
That would have oversight over until a

1151
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,559
Or something along those lines

1152
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
She's just a rubber stamp

1153
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,519
What note 99% of that. What I'm talking about I'm talking about like how they have

1154
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
Civilian Watchdog group

1155
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Veteran place for police

1156
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
Departments in some

1157
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:26,015
I agree

1158
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,087
And you have to have like tops

1159
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,879
Clearance for these people that

1160
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:34,463
Ridiculously excited that point do they be

1161
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Become a part of this

1162
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Security apparatus

1163
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
Wakeboard almost 38

1164
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:45,471
I can't be from the body politic right but can't be from Congress

1165
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,519
They're going along with it

1166
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
Then we get into the f

1167
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
Be safe and you can see how they have been captured

1168
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
The same offices

1169
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
The bank's that theoretically

1170
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,623
Do a lot of good just to move their office

1171
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,671
We're not going to solve this issue

1172
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Will

1173
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,023
I think you and I are going to get to the bottom of this

1174
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:13,631
Tonight

1175
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,167
How many more codes to get through

1176
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,823
And how we solve the security apparatus

1177
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
The way you were talking

1178
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
To some extent makes

1179
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
It sound like I'm in

1180
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Favor

1181
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Augustine

1182
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:31,551
I understand that but it could be biscuit

1183
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:35,903
I just find it to be a very fascinating question

1184
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
That we wind up

1185
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,487
I think we wind up getting

1186
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
That were able to talk about

1187
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Insofar as

1188
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,911
The same the same question that we often have witches

1189
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:51,007
What happens when Alex Jones is on our side

1190
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,799
In a certain way

1191
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,591
Can we utilize

1192
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,383
No

1193
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,967
I can never be sir

1194
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
In the same way

1195
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
Somatic blog

1196
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,855
That attack Alex for being

1197
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,903
A shield of Israel and stuff like that

1198
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
Do you make some good points about how

1199
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,487
Jim sometimes they are never allies

1200
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
They can't be

1201
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,791
Right

1202
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
It's frustrating in some ways because

1203
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,423
Like it in a perfect world

1204
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
You could

1205
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,239
Theoretically team up with Alex

1206
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,775
Can fix the drug laws

1207
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,615
Forfeiture

1208
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
But you can't

1209
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,431
So you're debunking The Art of War

1210
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
The enemy of my enemy

1211
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Is not always

1212
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Absolutely

1213
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
Alright get in bed with

1214
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
People and you just

1215
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,671
Too much comes along with

1216
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
Don't get in bed with son to

1217
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
It's not a bun

1218
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
Slipper Alex

1219
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
Explain what some of his

1220
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,143
Fears about social

1221
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
He's not right

1222
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,639
Unemployment sometimes when they were

1223
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Which is welfare

1224
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,039
Godiva chocolate shop

1225
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
Service jobs

1226
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,671
Undercut workers

1227
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,975
Your welfare card

1228
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,839
Psychological evaluation psychology

1229
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
No.

1230
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,055
If you're on welfare you should not be spending movies

1231
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,663
Military

1232
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,991
Watch

1233
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,063
Sanctions against

1234
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:47,743
That's an interesting sort of a 2B 2C daddy kind of

1235
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,767
Through

1236
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Yes it's Warfare

1237
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Is not

1238
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,447
A realistic

1239
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Sick pass that

1240
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
People go down

1241
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,543
When they get social assistance

1242
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Not really

1243
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
It doesn't even track gramatik

1244
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:08,479
No but it is it is it does make sense in terms of his fears because it all does come back

1245
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
The gun grabbing

1246
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,319
I'll get it back where it was two sizes

1247
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
These negative path lead

1248
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,439
R2r gun

1249
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:22,559
That's if you are mentally ill we should take

1250
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:28,959
He starts at Point a which is people going on welfare

1251
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,007
The path of the yugos from agency

1252
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
Is it is nonsense

1253
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,079
Bizarre it doesn't it doesn't

1254
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
Connect anyway

1255
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,151
That's what that's all fun and games

1256
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:44,319
I guess this next clip

1257
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Perfecto

1258
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
This is so f*****

1259
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
LeBron

1260
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:52,511
Narcissistic childlike smile

1261
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,071
Like they're five dressed up like Batman

1262
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
Guitar birthday party

1263
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,679
The order the five-year-old getting the ride with the cops

1264
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
Batman

1265
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:10,687
Cystic glow in their eyes

1266
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
Shell's actuate

1267
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
Become the wrong person

1268
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,575
Narcissistic

1269
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,599
More about

1270
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,159
Humanity and building system

1271
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Honorable

1272
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
You're still an individual

1273
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
But it is more

1274
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:27,583
Honor System

1275
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,399
Abby

1276
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,751
Mickey videos

1277
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
The Dark Tower

1278
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
20 starts

1279
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,639
Calling about your old books

1280
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
But

1281
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,991
Narcissistic

1282
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,063
There's ever been

1283
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,855
Do you know who

1284
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
If you talkin about the

1285
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,999
Make-a-Wish kid

1286
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
Became Batman for a day and everybody

1287
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
Join them in the sink

1288
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,935
The Make-A-Wish kid

1289
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,311
Make-a-Wish kid was fighting leukemia

1290
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,847
Okay

1291
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
Alright

1292
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
That's f***** up

1293
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
Narcissistic kid riding along with the police cuz he dressed up like Batman

1294
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,063
Birthday party

1295
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,415
Tv85 leukemia at 1

1296
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
People fighting it for 4 years

1297
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,535
He's a Make-a-Wish kid all he wanted to do was be Batman

1298
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,679
So the people got together

1299
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,263
And they created a whole scenario where any Stop The Riddler

1300
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,055
And people

1301
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Did a

1302
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,223
Very good and charitable thing and it is Twisted

01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:54,623
Tire World part it was one of the rare like viral kind of things

1304

Just like god dammit that's great

1305
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,023
Alex Jones

1306
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
LeBron just not narcissistic

1307
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:13,311
Compared to what he deserves to be placed on being probably the best player of the sport ever

1308
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:19,711
Call Sabine one of the most physically impose

1309
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:24,831
Using athlete ever and this presentation is stupid and all this stuff is very racially loaded

1310
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Absolutely you listen to interviews

1311
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:31,487
He is not stupid at all.

1312
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Modest

1313
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Ford

1314
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,583
Looking for his talent level person

1315
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,703
Like people have asked him about

1316
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Plays

1317
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,007
Like 10 years ago

1318
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,055
And he remembers not just the

1319
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
Play he remembers

1320
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:51,711
His thought process through and he remembers how he spun the ball through the like he's a

1321
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,503
Brilliant map

1322
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,831
Unfortunately 2014 I believe

1323
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,903
If I remember correctly that was right around the time he was making

1324
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
Deal out of his

1325
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
Decision

1326
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
I've going to the Heat

1327
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:13,215
Don't even bring it up bring it up if you didn't know anything else about him

1328
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,007
Yeah that would give a bath

1329
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
Taste that was bad

1330
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,591
All right but a lot of that is marketing

1331
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
How much of that was his

1332
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,063
Choice or his idea unclear

1333
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,647
Yeah who cares at the end of the day

1334
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
Now

1335
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
At the end there

1336
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
He's getting every

1337
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,559
Just putting aside him shiting on a Make-a-Wish kid

1338
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,911
At the end are you getting into

1339
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:48,543
He's gay.

1340
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:57,247
I wasn't

1341
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:03,647
Sure I wasn't at

1342
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,631
At the Ender's getting into like this

1343
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Gene is the

1344
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:21,055
You want to be a man you want to go and be with honorable people he's such a

1345
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
He's such a

1346
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,151
Weird f****** ass on here is where we take our jump

1347
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:29,759
Into esoteric nonsense we're going to find

1348
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,039
Real f*****-up

1349
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,319
Laughing as he says

1350
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
A couple of

1351
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,879
Weird brags about his past

1352
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
That I can

1353
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,695
Handsome agenor

1354
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,631
No you haven't

1355
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,167
And that was no you haven't

1356
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
What a fifteen-year-old

1357
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:57,407
Ancestors and their family names to be strong

1358
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,199
15 year old

1359
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,807
If you are a man by the side and almost every culture

1360
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:07,903
What

1361
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,767
25 mil

1362
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,935
I want to have some fun first

1363
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,783
Only worried about yourself when you lose everything

1364
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:39,903
Collectivism

1365
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,487
Free association

1366
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
Literally stereo

1367
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,887
Civilization

1368
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,983
Imposed by those that wish to sabotage

1369
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,591
Great secrets

1370
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,919
Known by all cultures thrive

1371
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,783
Forgotten secrets

1372
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,831
Revolution

1373
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:15,231
That's why people in every old culture

1374
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
It was a thriving Noble culture

1375
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,351
Noble

1376
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:24,703
Their honor at the fact it like a

1377
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Bulldog

1378
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,823
Hold on and never release

1379
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,639
A all seasons

1380
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,687
I think a b**** got over the wall

1381
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,479
Misogynist

1382
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Senior bulldog

1383
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,951
A lot of people out there claim you want Liberty

1384
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
Contest

1385
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
But you don't act like

1386
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Perennial

1387
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,655
Has Birthright of George

1388
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
So there's a lot of dog whistling in there

1389
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
It was

1390
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
But it was it's almost

1391
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,919
Too dumb

1392
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,967
Lunatic

1393
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,759
To really be effective

1394
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,087
His dog was other stuff about like

1395
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
We want to be

1396
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:22,047
Individuals freely associating and that is the real collectivism

1397
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
Willie actuated

1398
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
He does not know what the word Act

1399
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
I doubt it but all that stuff is

1400
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,263
Rambling nonsense

1401
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,567
I don't see any of

1402
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Principles

1403
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
Place in a lot of pain

1404
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,663
Civilizations that I've

1405
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
Read about

1406
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,015
What you haven't read about all of the ancient

1407
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Civilization

1408
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,623
All of the ones that have right except of course

1409
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:51,231
Free pre-literacy

1410
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:52,767
F*** you

1411
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
I know that

1412
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Especially the

1413
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Most

1414
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
Cultures didn't have an

1415
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,399
Idea of the free market

1416
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,079
Not a big deal if you look into like Native American civilization

1417
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
You look into

1418
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,943
Bad way to put it either the first peoples

1419
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,271
Yeah you look at a lot of South American cultures

1420
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
Even

1421
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,575
Summon Africa you don't

1422
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,367
Even have an idea of manhood

1423
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
That was all about dudes

1424
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
Yeah

1425
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,535
Nothing about women

1426
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
FurReal matriarchy

1427
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:32,447
Nothing he has no interest in talking about women

1428
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Place

1429
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,311
In society and you kind of have to assume that means

1430
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,847
His vision of it is

1431
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Observe

1432
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
Division of it is secondary to

1433
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Twomad

1434
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,967
It's just

1435
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
You need

1436
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
To be women for men

1437
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,087
And that man of course

1438
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Pichu

1439
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,231
Code of chivalry or whatever that he's old

1440
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,535
More about that

1441
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
Clear as it goes along but I'm

1442
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
To jump into this

1443
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
One of my favorite thing

1444
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,703
This is one of Alex's weird childhood Bragg

1445
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:11,103
This cannot be true I guarantee please this is my sound

1446
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
The specifics here

1447
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
So stupid

1448
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,271
Narcissism at about 85 I remember it

1449
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,343
Understanding

1450
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,391
Imagining I'm a team

1451
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:29,791
Imagining I'm powerful imagining I'm dominant imagining is is a fraud and a

1452
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
Why then I could see another children

1453
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,375
Literally

1454
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:40,543
With the wisdom

1455
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,639
Who sings the old men

1456
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:51,551
LeBron James who is literally a child ladies and gentlemen

1457
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
Liquid death

1458
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
And poisoned

1459
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
Do shine up cuz my laundry

1460
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
6:30

1461
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,095
Obama is using bron James like a puppy

1462
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,887
A bag of candy

1463
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,703
Get the child in the back of the

1464
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Torture Center

1465
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,847
Nelly weeklyrides unpause here for a sec

1466
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
I don't know how one individual

1467
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,247
14 snuff films probably small logistic

1468
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,807
I think the limit per person

1469
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,695
But I don't blame the puppy

1470
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
What is pumping

1471
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,351
LeBron James

1472
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
A weapon system

1473
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
Great

1474
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
Great

1475
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
All that aside

1476
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,663
So at 5 let's talk about child develop

1477
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
This is knock

1478
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,527
Do you know what's going on with your cognitive development

1479
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,319
The age of 3 when Alex Jones

1480
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,135
Old man

1481
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
I think that's when you first

1482
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
It was like

1483
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
All the child psychology

1484
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
At 3

1485
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
You are

1486
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,631
First learning how to interact with

1487
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,911
Other human being

1488
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,519
Subway

1489
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
Guttural

1490
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Speech patterns

1491
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
You were first

1492
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Your first perhaps

1493
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,151
Define Concha

1494
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
You have your baby

1495
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,455
Now

1496
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
You are also

1497
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
Able to access

1498
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
But only

1499
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
If you're at

1500
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Individual

1501
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
They have this year from

1502
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
From the

1503
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
By the office of child development

1504
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
Pittsburgh

1505
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,239
Children start to pay

1506
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Stories

1507
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
And are able to respond to

1508
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
In the story

1509
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
That's how their brain

1510
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
Is that they're able to understand

1511
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
At 3

1512
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
For the first time

1513
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:03,391
Size

1514
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
Add yellow and blue

1515
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,951
They start to understand

1516
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:11,327
Counting on a very basic level at which

1517
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
All that stuff

1518
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,167
Understand

1519
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,447
Sound similar

1520
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Like

1521
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,055
They start to be able to tell the difference

1522
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Difference

1523
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,383
And socialism

1524
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,735
Start to be able to develop the idea of

1525
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,295
So scared of like

1526
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
Things under the bed

1527
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,927
Start to have a creative imagine

1528
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
A tiny bit

1529
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
In terms of being able to

1530
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Play make-believe

1531
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
Sorta relevant to Alex's

1532
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:47,423
More relevant is the fear of the monster under the bed

1533
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
Think that's where Al

1534
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Haha

1535
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,031
I'm so at this point

1536
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
For your cognitive development

1537
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Involved

1538
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,663
Where you're able to

1539
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
That age for your able to

1540
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
To stretch the truth a little bit

1541
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,807
The children before that generally aren't able to

1542
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,575
Come up with

1543
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
Counterfactual state

1544
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:12,255
Children were also able to much more than before work

1545
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
Cooperative

1546
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,071
How's that evolves around

1547
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,703
They are

1548
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
Accessing

1549
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,847
Where do we get to accessing the wisdom of the ages

1550
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Maui

1551
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,711
At this point child development age 5

1552
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,735
Irrelevant

1553
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,295
Children

1554
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,343
Their play is more evolved

1555
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
Costumes

1556
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
At age 5

1557
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
You start to get the

1558
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Maybe Alex

1559
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:45,791
You know dates

1560
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
3

1561
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,959
You became more able to

1562
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Stretch the truth

1563
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
Rabbit 85 evolve

1564
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,943
That's my theory and I'm not going

1565
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,711
Stick to it

1566
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,527
Man what kind of donut

1567
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,063
Would claim that it aids

1568
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
5he

1569
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Man you understand

1570
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,439
Legitimately

1571
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Is when you

1572
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,255
You start to be able to understand that night

1573
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
And they are

1574
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
And they're on a cycle

1575
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,631
Yeah that's the kind of a development that you're able at

1576
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,679
Able to understand at age 5

1577
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
Like

1578
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,983
You might be able to count

1579
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
At 8 spot

1580
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
Credibly

1581
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Developed

1582
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,895
Unless you're one of these savant

1583
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,199
Right

1584
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,479
Is not that based on

1585
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
But we've been able to

1586
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Discern

1587
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
He is still unable to

1588
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,415
You might be able to identify all 26

1589
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,999
Might really

1590
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
I was able to

1591
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,351
Look some people are on different scales is

1592
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,935
Was just generally generally speaking we're developing

1593
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,959
What is at those

1594
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
I don't know

1595
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:03,871
Steel male child psychologist

1596
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
They can't

1597
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,039
Diamond exotic Diamond gusset saying about it

1598
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,343
Steel mills went down south

1599
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:19,743
So like the only reason I bring of these sort of examples to give a generalized sense cuz I don't know if our listeners all have kids

1600
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,303
Leaving like that but like there's no way at 8

1601
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
3 Alex's

1602
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,375
Like I don't think he could even

1603
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:29,983
You know I think happened I think he watched a Wes Anderson movie and was like I'm going to pretend I was

1604
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:35,103
Yeah that's how I know a lot of people

1605
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:41,759
That's my that's my best guess

1606
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,343
Salinger

1607
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,975

Did you notice how he switched

1645
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Listen to his fake voice

As the narcissist

1652
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,824
The reflection is not

01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Reality

1654
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Reflection

We have a photo of the grizzly bear

1660
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
Not the true genetics of the grizzly bear

1661
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:37,632
Not the way it actually works

1662
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
What is a photograph

1663
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,520

He's just

1673
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
He is just

1674
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Trying to

1675
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000

Manly Hood honor blah blah blah

I've milk this for all it's worth let's go to Special Report

1685
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,328

She's not done

1689
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
Some of that weird heading on

1690
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
But

1691
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,872
When he comes back from the

1692
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
These regroup

1693
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,176
After that

1694
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
He gets back

1695
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
Get back into Russia

1696
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648

Nuclear war

1699
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,216
Ironic in current context

1700
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,800
Not

1701
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Can see him be like

1702
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:58,944
Actually I'm going to go with

1703
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,480
Nuclear war cuz he's white

1704
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
So there might be a chance

1705
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,976
After he says that

1706
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,584
I need to I need

1707
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,960
I need the sperm this one up

1708
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,520
What do you like

1709
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,336
Outdoor

1710
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:29,408
He's trending

1711
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,576
Absolutely

1712
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,880
Yay so

1713
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,696
I mean I have a lot of feelings

1714
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,512
I like some of these Noble culture ideas

1715
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,328
I have the blood within me

1716
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
There's a lot of

1717
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,888
Vaguely racist

1718
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
Talk

1719
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,216
He starts off his next wife with a

1720
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
Let's make the subtext

1721
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,336
Little little race

1722
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
Graphic 12 as well

1723
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,224
Already

1724
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:12,160
Ocean White Lane

1725
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,208
Announced by the way

1726
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,864
Watching

1727
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
Don't struggle

1728
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,360
Important before they do the procedure

1729
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:35,968
Your mouth

1730
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:39,552
This is going to hurt there's not going to be any anesthesia

1731
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,952
I would like that.

1732
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,424
Patriot Supply

1733
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:01,824
He's noticed he's not a smooth with the ad transition back then

1734
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:08,224
Mypatriotsupply.com Alex

1735
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,832
My Patriot Supply products

1736
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
Interesting

1737
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:18,208
Do you know if you if you could make a Supercut of things that he said

1738
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,768
And it would sound exactly like

1739
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,792
A serial killer

1740
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,328
Right before murdering

1741
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,472
Thousand percent before he

1742
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
Yeah but I feel like it's

1743
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,056
Because he said those things to evict

1744
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,152
I don't think you're the only person who's

1745
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:41,504
Something that I was

1746
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
Is the idea of the demographic

1747
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
Cliff

1748
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,160
What comes down to is generally like we're not breed

1749
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,464
That's exactly what he said

1750
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,816
Ideas of like we are not going to be able to replace everybody

1751
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,864
Acura TLX not accurate

1752
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,888
Can pretend that it's be

1753
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,704
Because more immigrants are coming in

1754
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
And all of that

1755
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,264
But ultimately goes down to

1756
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,312
White people talk more

1757
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,640
So earlier in the show Alex

1758
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:12,224
He was talking about his fears about welfare

1759
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,016
Declared mental

1760
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:18,112
CL

1761
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,904
Alex

1762
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Reveals

1763
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,744
That

1764
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,048
Being mentally ill is cool

1765
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
Trendy

1766
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,936
Gusting f******

1767
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Please don't

1768
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,784
No

1769
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,632
Hospital

1770
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
Mongozo

1771
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:09,056
My child has a mental illness I'm going through a lot

1772
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:12,128
It's really the coolest thing to do

1773
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,600
Patriotic

1774
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:32,352
Artificially schizophrenic street corner and you can wash your hands

1775
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:38,752
You know we don't know why is a mentally ill woman on the street

1776
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
Bobby is what

1777
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:44,640
We did the best we could with the doctors will be right back stay with

1778
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,688
So

1779
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Food

1780
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
Dude

1781
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,928
I mean it's so interesting

1782
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
F******

1783
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:02,816
So many layers there are

1784
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
So much

1785
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
So much

1786
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,448
So much hurt in that one clip

1787
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,240
So much damage done

1788
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,032
So many lives in that one clip

1789
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:15,104
If people like listen to him

1790
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
You are

1791
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,968
Possibly stigmatizing children and their parents eyes

1792
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,016
I mean

1793
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:26,112
If you are if you are an Infowars devout listener and you have children

1794
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
And your kids are

1795
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,160
Mental illness

1796
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
Help

1797
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
Do you need to get

1798
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
You need to get

1799
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:38,144
Do children help almost Christian Scientist I had a mental

1800
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,168
50

1801
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,496
I didn't do anything about it

1802
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,776
Tell my parents

1803
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,080
Cuz they didn't believe in mental illness

1804
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:47,872
I didn't do anything about it

1805
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
Until I was 20

1806
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,688
Because they didn't

1807
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,480
Believe in mental illness

1808
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
And I was

1809
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,272
Braids

1810
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
I was

1811
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,112
Terrified that they were actually going to stop

1812
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:01,696
Caring about me or they were going to

1813
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:05,024
Send me to some sort of religious therapy

1814
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
Get them

1815
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:07,072
Type of s***

1816
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,376
Hit so close to home today

1817
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,656
It's f******

1818
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,728
That mentality of that rhetoric will lead

1819
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Two peoples death

1820
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,592
Absolutely does quite quite frankly I mean I don't want to get it

1821
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:22,432
In-depth about specifics of a lot of stuff but like

1822
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
If it weren't

1823
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,760
For therapy when I was

1824
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,528
Am I

1825
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,296
Team

1826
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,320
Even

1827
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,344
Sometime I spend

1828
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
Mental hospital

1829
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
I would be

1830
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:38,304
I would absolutely be debt because

1831
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,840
Why I went to the hospital

1832
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
Cool and trendy

1833
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,168
It's because

1834
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:43,936
I had

1835
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,472
Serious issues

1836
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:46,752
From

1837
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:51,616
Alex good debate all day whether it's red dye or sugar

1838
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,456
You know anything like that

1839
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,248
In the street and say

1840
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,296
Oh we tried but they're mentally ill

1841
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:03,392
People who don't believe in mental illness or people from Noble

1842
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:08,256
Yes yeah

1843
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
Absolutely

1844
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Real and let me see

1845
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,888
This

1846
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,704
Like

1847
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,728
6

1848
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,800
We're getting better as a society in many ways

1849
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
About mental health issue

1850
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:23,360
In terms of D Stickman

1851
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
Sensational

1852
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,176
But at the same time

1853
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,968
I know at least

1854
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:29,760
At this point

1855
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
People are not

1856
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,088
Bragging about their kids

1857
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
Being mentally ill

1858
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,928
That's not something that happens that's not like

1859
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:40,000
Hey Mike it's f***** up omigod you get snow out

1860
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,280
That was something like that

1861
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Because

1862
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,072
There

1863
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,352
Most parents

1864
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
Hey babe

1865
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,168
I have two remotes

1866
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,496
But I think there's a lot of people look at their children

1867
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Themselves

1868
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,568
You don't brag about negative things about your kids

1869
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
Negative

1870
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,920
Do not like

1871
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:03,808
There's a bit about

1872
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:07,136
Being bipolar and it's a really old bit and I couldn't

1873
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,672
I thought about not doing it at

1874
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,488
But everytime I go on the road

1875
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
In some shity small

1876
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:15,584
I get at least one person who comes up to me

1877
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,120
In these small towns

1878
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,144
Thank you

1879
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,936

Thank you for talking about this because nobody talks about it and 8

1882

It really means a lot to me

1883
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:40,672
SpeedZone import actually just f****** give people a space to talk about

1884
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:44,000
Something that they are ashamed up that they're afraid of

1885
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024
All of the

1886
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,048
The s*** and it is

1887
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
It kills me

1888
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
Kills me

1889
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
Will do this s***

1890
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
Because it

1891
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Mrbeast

1892
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,544
Legend suicide attempt

1893
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
That's it.

1894
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,872
This type of s*** is

1895
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,176
God dammit I could

1896
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
I could be dead

1897
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:09,088
I could legit be dead because of this exact red

1898
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,112
You're great

1899
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:16,768
I'm in the next Club Alex F

1900
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:20,352
Globalist

1901
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:23,680
Club Alex Harkens back to a time that never

1902
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:39,296
Wonder wonder what he's talking about Austin I run into YouTube football players

1903
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,600

1905
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:47,744
Arrogant people walk Walking pitbulls downtown

1906
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:52,864
Bumping into people

1907
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,216
A bunch of narcissistic mentally ill twitch

1908
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:07,200
Because first of all they weren't

1909
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,992
To say that I guess that's true

1910
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
That's again

1911
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
That's just

1912
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
I think it's a little race

1913
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,024
Real

1914
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,328
Only white people used to do athletic

1915
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,632
Haha

1916
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:32,032
Yeah all the history of in Major League Baseball

1917
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:36,896
Major League Baseball up until like 5 years word arrogant

1918
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
Alexandra struggling to not say like

1919
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,760
Uppity

1920
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,552
If we transition

1921
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,832
From weird sort of race

1922
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,856
Stuff to gender

1923
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,416
And I want you to succeed be successful

1924
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,000
Competition with a strong

1925
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,048
Society strong male-driven

1926
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
Society

1927
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,864
Patriarchal

1928
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:05,312
Buy 1776 individualism

1929
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:09,152
So he's made it clear there a patriarchy

1930
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,920
Empowers women

1931
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
I know their place

1932
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:16,320
I don't know I don't know

1933
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:22,976
I don't I don't understand what you saying but he's never been impaled ribbon

1934
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Society

1935
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
Clear

1936
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
That's so clear

1937
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,608
Histories

1938
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,400
At least of all the cultures

1939
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
Patriarchy

1940
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,520
Are self-perpetuating for machines

1941
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:39,872
That old early

1942
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,176
That that's

1943
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,992
F****** monstrous world

1944
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,784
Through most of them

1945
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Pre-market

1946
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
Yep but

1947
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,672
Whenever you give women power

1948
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,232
Only good things

1949
01:34:55,488 --> 01:35:00,096
It does seem like there's never been a negative result of giving women more power

1950
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Look at

1951
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,960
Trying to think of one negative result

1952
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Societies throughout

1953
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
No tribal time

1954
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
Right

1955
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,824
Trying to think of one

1956
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
Sprouted into a

1957
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:14,688
No

1958
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,736
Generally speaking matriarchal

1959
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,528
Societies always

1960
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
Prize the happiness of

1961
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,856
All members over

1962
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
They

1963
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,976
Everybody got laid a lot more

1964
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,560
Simply because women have the power of choice

1965
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,632
Send I also that you know all number of

1966
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:36,704
Selfish male Pursuits are better off

1967
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:46,176
Absolutely

1968
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,504
Alex Azar

1969
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,552
He's getting

1970
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:55,648
Weird rambly esoteric headspace about masculinity and never bring it up

1971
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,464
Towards the end of

1972
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
The show be like

1973
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,792
The global tape man

1974
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072
Driven Society

1975
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,120
It is all just Victor

1976
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,400
But it is all just

1977
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:09,216
I am I don't want to give up my place in

1978
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:14,080
Is there any harkensback to athletes being better when he was younger

1979
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,616
Or any of this other ship

1980
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,152
Talkin about is when

1981
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
White man wearing Chargers

1982
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,480
Delegate people have to hide

1983
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,856
Make America great again

1984
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:31,744
Of course there's no way that someone is on the radio spouting this kind of rhetoric

1985
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
Who has a history

1986
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,376
Long documented history of bigotry who is about to begin

1987
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,680
Can't not think that that's what he's talkin

1988
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
It's f***** up

1989
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,496
Really really

1990
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
Deeply

1991
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,056
Deeply troubling

1992
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
Man

1993
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:54,016
Better example of why women

1994
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,552
Should have way more power it

1995
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,088
It's just listen to this into

1996
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,112
Secure

1997
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Same

1998
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
Piece of s***

1999
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
No much

2000
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Misplaced in

2001
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
Insecurities

2002
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,584
He's a fragile man

2003
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,632
Fear their sowa

2004
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
Braids

2005
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:15,520
It's amazing how terrified these people are under the year of

2006
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:20,128
Righteous anger and positions of power

2007
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:23,968
Doesn't relate to his like love of Putin

2008
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,760
Yeah

2009
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,528
That's

2010
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,808
He loves big dicks

2011
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,368
Love big dicks more than Alex

2012
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
Love's

2013
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:34,720
Besides Queen

2014
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,792
Cancer ribbons

2015
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,056
Replace cancer ribbon

2016
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:49,824
Pens with

2017
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,592
I think

2018
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
I think

2019
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
You should do a second

2020
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
Not a good idea

2021
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,856
Nada

2022
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,904
We know there's a Eugenics operation

2023
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,560
You think that's too long

2024
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,352
In the White Stripes

2025
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,888
Little messages

2026
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,080
There's a program to destroy the families

2027
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,664
There is a world government

2028
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:37,184
The New World Order

2029
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,464
They are the enemy

2030
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,304
Discover the enemy or perish

2031
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,592
Giant sticker

2032
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,640
We're talkin billboard at this point

2033
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,480
People be driving by squinting like what the fuc

2034
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
Positivity f****** accident

2035
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:08,160
That's a bad idea to write that on Eddie Vegas

2036
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:13,792
He'd start with a big letter a better just get smaller and smaller as he tried to send

2037
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,144
He has a lot of spin on the situation

2038
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,960
And it's not good

2039
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,800
It's pretty bad it's the Russian lion

2040
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,080
Broke

2041
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,664
He does bring up one thing that I think is

2042
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,944
Worth mentioning

2043
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,248
And it's an article that

2044
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,784
Interviewed Ron Paul

2045
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,552
On the subject

2046
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832
I'll just play this

2047
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,512
Residence Inn

2048
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:50,656
Autonomous region

2049
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,680
Scotland

2050
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,664
96.7

2051
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,712
That sounds like a

2052
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,272
Suspicious number

2053
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:10,112
Very similar to the number of

2054
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,976
If you look into it there are there have been

2055
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
Done after the fact that say something

2056
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:18,816
The tune of

2057
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,120
80%

2058
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,656
Of the public think that

2059
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,192
Warfare

2060
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,032
Reflect the will of the people

2061
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,568
Suspicious too it's also 6

2062
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,408
Per cent lower than the people who voted for it

2063
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,968
Then that seems to be a significant percentage

2064
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:41,088
Seemed strange the reasons the International Community generally is called

2065
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,368
Referendum vote in

2066
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Question

2067
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,952
And one of the reasons is that what happened

2068
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,768
The peninsula of Korea was

2069
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Occupied by Russia

2070
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,888
It's on

2071
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,960
Clear I don't I don't think there's enough

2072
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,240
Information

2073
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,264
To say it was

2074
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:04,640
Completely rig the vote or anything like that but there are other red flags

2075
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:07,712
Generally dictators end up winning by

2076
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:14,112
97% very common number generally whenever There Are Places

2077
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Is that our voting

2078
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,672
Occupied by

2079
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:19,232
Interested parties are me

2080
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
It doesn't

2081
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,304
It's not fair it's not fair election

2082
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,096
It's weird how

2083
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,144
Huge

2084
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,936
The population of the vote was

2085
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,216
For Hitler whenever

2086
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,240
Invaded

2087
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,264
France was like

2088
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:34,336
Vote for Hitler

2089
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,920
Yeah and then the other the other aspects to is

2090
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Is there were tons of

2091
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
Reports of

2092
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
Pre-marked ballots

2093
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,600
And stuff like that that there's a lot of

2094
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,208
Build-A-Bear in relay

2095
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,768
Tow the Russian lion

2096
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,304
I don't believe it

2097
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,328
Heat would be like

2098
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,352
Oh my God

2099
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,376
It's so great

2100
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,472
Even a newbie like this

2101
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:07,872
Even in Catalonia where they were talking about the vote tally for Pro Independence

2102
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:11,200
Even then

2103
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,248
They also carry out of that with

2104
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,296
And the other side

2105
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
Entirely so it's like

2106
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,952
Yes independent 1 with 90% of

2107
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:26,048
People reporting but all the other people who would have voted no

2108
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
You know

2109
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,936
Boycotted the vote in Scotland vote

2110
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,728
Tippecanoe

2111
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Devoted

2112
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
We believe that the Breck's

2113
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,528
I'm going to end up working I don't think it's going to happen

2114
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
But if it does

2115
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:52,672
Northern Ireland which will be very awkward

2116
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,768
So the reason that I believe that Alex

2117
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,048
Incredibly biased

2118
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,096
Coverage

2119
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
Is everything I know about it

2120
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,704
This neck

2121
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
Where he is

2122
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,080
Super defensive about how patriotic he is

2123
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:13,920
I meant says something right at the end of this two-and-a-half minute clip

2124
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:15,200
It makes me think

2125
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,248
You. The protest too much

2126
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:29,280
You couldn't

2127
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,072
So also

2128
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,864
That's bad

2129
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,936
That is also

2130
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,960
White

2131
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,288
Strength

2132
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,208
Confederate

2133
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,376
You scumbag trailers

2134
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,312
Tell me I work for some foreign government

2135
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:19,968
You know you are you work for a

2136
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:35,328
Can you tell me I'm not a loyal American I will stomp you into the ground for the four years where my answers

2137
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:40,960
Ancestors one

2138
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,928
America

2139
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,000
Thomas

2140
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,688
You are the rightful heir

2141
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,040
Why

2142
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:37,280
You want to raise your own children you don't want to abort

2143
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,496
Or where you're from

2144
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:05,440
Can push around 10

2145
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:25,664
Also love the Russians

2146
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:32,064
Do we have 50% off sales for joining Colombia's Independence

2147
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,624
Same structure

2148
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,648
That's f***** up

2149
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:42,048
Yeah I didn't even think about that I just thought of the comedy minutes of

2150
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
America

2151
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,376
You've hit me with enough add pivots

2152
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,680
For me to know when a pivot happen

2153
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:50,240
Yeah it's structurally tonally X

2154
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,008
A hundred percent

2155
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,288
What a fucken day

2156
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
So I mean

2157
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688
Sure

2158
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,480
Russia is a communist country

2159
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
No

2160
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,552
And that's great

2161
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,832
I guess

2162
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,600
Right

2163
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:08,160
I mean in terms of Alex's rhetoric of being like

2164
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,488
You know there are sovereign country in whatever

2165
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:14,560
Economic system has always been

2166
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,352
A autocratic oligarch

2167
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,656
No it is not

2168
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
Putin has been in

2169
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
Power Center

2170
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,240
2000

2171
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,800
And he has been up to some s*** ever

2172
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Before that

2173
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,016
I need shown his colors

2174
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,040
In many ways

2175
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Stripes

2176
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,624
And the fact that Alex Wood

2177
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,392
Sync

2178
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,672
Like

2179
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,696
They're cool

2180
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:45,792
To the extent of Love Freedom

2181
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
Yeah

2182
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:48,352
Anthony

2183
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,376
To the very

2184
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,400
Stamp if you would

2185
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:52,192
Make that kind of a statement

2186
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,520
After this rambly b******* about patriotism

2187
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Just shows like

2188
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:02,176
Either he's the dumbest man in the world or he's a foreign agent

2189
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,968
Exactly I mean like

2190
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:08,320
I know we don't have evidence of a believe everything except

2191
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,624
Andrea Lee

2192
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:13,440
Like on the last episode we

2193
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:17,024
We covered hoping to be the last one that is put out at the

2194
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,608
This point on the episode that we did back in January

2195
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,632
16

2196
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,656
Where are you

2197
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,448
Like my numbers have doubled

2198
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:30,080
And my money hasn't gone up right we were very clear that he is the

2199
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,640
Beneficiary of the Russian Bots

2200
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,664
And the Russian

2201
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,456
Traffic

2202
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,480
Bean Boozled

2203
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,504
That sort of thing

2204
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
And when you start to question

2205
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:41,088
F*** would they choose Alex Jones

2206
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,368
We have this glimpse

2207
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,392
From 2014

2208
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,184
She's been

2209
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,256
Pro-russia all along

2210
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,280
Because he is

2211
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,560
What they would want

2212
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,328
To push

2213
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,120
That is the only

2214
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,168
In which I think

2215
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,192
Very

2216
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,008
It's very reasonable and probably

2217
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,312
Legally inexorable in the heat

2218
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
Probably dumb

2219
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,384
I mean word 2014

2220
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,664
Yeah

2221
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,736
Hey I mean are they pushing him

2222
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,272
No because they think

2223
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,064
That he's what they want

2224
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,344
In 22

2225
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,392
16 or are they pushing him because they've been

2226
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,416
Cultivating him

2227
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,488
The same way that they cultivated Trump back in 2030

2228
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:25,888
We certainly don't know when he had that talk with Russian intelligence and listen

2229
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:28,704
But I think that's instrumental

2230
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:30,496
But he has been going on RT

2231
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
At least 2,000

2232
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,384
Cupboard on the last episode

2233
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,176
The state-run propaganda

2234
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,784
So I mean I don't know I don't know I don't know how deep back and cultivation app

2235
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,808
Aspect of the ghost

2236
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,856
I'd be willing to believe that that was Maurice

2237
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,648
But also he's clearly

2238
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:52,000
I don't think I would I think

2239
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:56,352
Are flattering him in order to

2240
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,120
Create

2241
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,424
Willingness tabpro Rochester

2242
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,008
Put on man even then you have to

2243
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,288
Consider to that like

2244
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:08,640
His favorite politician in America is Ron Paul and Ron Paul's response

2245
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,920
Leukemia is who cares

2246
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,688
Right

2247
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:17,088
But at least within Ron Paul's kind of operating ideology

2248
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,880
That's mainly just because

2249
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:19,904
It's over there

2250
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:24,256
True you could say like hey did you know that

2251
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:30,656
Russian nukes all of Europe probably likes to cross an ocean

2252
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:38,336
I don't know it's just it's it's interesting but I would be willing to believe that

2253
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,128
They've done Alex is unaware of it

2254
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,688
To the extent that

2255
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:45,248
Clear surprise

2256
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:49,088
About the numbers going up in the sales not going yet

2257
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,904
So that I could believe that

2258
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
The unwitting beneficiary

2259
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
This

2260
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,000
Acceptance

2261
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
And push

2262
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,328
From the the box in the troll Farm

2263
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,376
Not willing to believe

2264
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,656
Is it Rodger Stone didn't

2265
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:07,520
I don't believe I absolutely don't believe

2266
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
I think Rodger stone is not a dumbass

2267
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:13,152
No he is part of influencing Alex

2268
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:16,480
And you can't be part of that without knowing the rest of the

2269
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:23,904
And this is Ken.

2270
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,536
Is unreasonable

2271
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,584
That it is impossible

2272
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,632
For him to be a foreign agent

2273
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:40,800
To you and this

2274
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,592
Amor amor

2275
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,920
Know that

2276
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,992
You know the more we find out about how Flynn was a

2277
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:49,760
A foreign agent

2278
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,552
How manafort was a foreign aid

2279
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,832
How all of these guys

2280
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,368
Have all been working

2281
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,392
For other gum

2282
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,208
Lobbying for other

2283
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,024
Not disclosing that

2284
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,560
How long

2285
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,328
Has that ship

2286
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,120
The answer is

2287
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:06,400
Probably forever

2288
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:12,544
Yeah probably a while there's absolutely

2289
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,384
To some extent

2290
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,176
It's not political

2291
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,504
Like I said

2292
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:26,368
That's why I buy Alex Jones

2293
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,928
Just want to get rich

2294
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:35,840
I don't know about Alex the more the all the bulshit flies away

2295
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,656
White male fear

2296
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:44,544
Absolutely relate to misogyny and racism

2297
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,312
It's real

2298
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
But even then

2299
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:50,688
That is that I would argue is also tied with

2300
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Looking for money

2301
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:56,832
Looking for money and looking for power are ultimately insecure things to

2302
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:04,256
Like donate to the shower

2303
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:10,656
Hazard Apartments to Palladium Luciano

2304
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,728
Sent up there and shitzu

2305
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:17,824
Please do check it out

2306
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:24,224
If you want to share that s*** on social media to help us out in terms of boosting the signal

2307
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:29,856
If you don't want to totally cool if you want that stuff on

2308
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:33,440
With knowledge underscore

2309
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,720
Fiber on Facebook

2310
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:37,536
You could do it there go to iTunes

2311
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,328
Because

2312
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:42,912
It was a bunch of

2313
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,472
Stars

2314
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:55,968
As long as you're going with the 5-star review you can say whatever the f*** you want a new game

2315
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:01,088
Meet us thing with a visor

2316
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:05,184
I do know it's just

2317
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,208
It's just

2318
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,256
You can make up a conspiracy theory about anything

2319
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:11,328
I think I would like to make up

2320
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
About 1

2321
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:15,680
Couch it that way

2322
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:18,240
But I want to make a couple hundred

2323
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:24,640
That's probably probably going to hurt traction

2324
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,920
Alright

2325
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,200
Okay so

2326
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,992
We've already covered the

2327
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,296
We know

2328
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,648
Reincarnated Alex Jones

2329
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,672
Talk about now

2330
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,952
Is what he's hiding in that

2331
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,512
Probably rations

2332
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,328
You know what I'm going to go with

2333
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
An extra set

2334
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:47,168
I want time went to a concert and hit a joint

2335
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,216
In my beard because I didn't had down my beard

2336
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,264
Sounds like I had a joint in there

2337
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,544
Put it up

2338
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,592
People don't advertise this about beard

2339
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,384
Very good containers for

2340
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,920
Absolutely

2341
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:04,320
Absolutely true that Whalers concerts a tolerable

2342
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:09,952
A guy who I would also like to entreat

2343
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,536
To go f*** themselves to go f*** yourself Jon rappoport

2344
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:21,728
Alexandra Thurston color
