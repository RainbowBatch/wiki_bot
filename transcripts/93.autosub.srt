1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Controlling

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,424
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
Do you know what you're not wrong

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
For today

5
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
Is all hands on deck we got some

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
Serious business

7
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:41,728
Before the show

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,520
Almost nothing

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,896
I did from a listener apologize

10
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,992
We're almost a year into this

11
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,296
You don't know almost nothing about Alex Jones

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,880
And that's an unfair way for us to open the shows kind of b*******

13
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
Highly overestimated my ability to remember anything that you tell me okay baby

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:11,424
And you have forgotten a lot of things maybe that's a more accurate way for us to start show

15
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
I think I really just talk

16
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Unfair

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
Rude I don't appreciate it

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,064
On Monday we put out an episode

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,672
I hate it it's frustrating it's the conversationally difficult I do I had to do

20
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
The 2015 investigation into

21
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Team Trump

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,520
We know pretty much for a fact that he joined up because

23
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Rodger stone is lying to him

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,152
On a massive scale Russia

25
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
It was where we left off

26
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,624
Mother

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
I was going to heavily into this episode actually

28
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,792
Realize I did something

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
I thought about it but I realized

30
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Capricious

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,496
In ending the investigation or in declaring case closed

32
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Absolutely

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,592
And one thing triggered that

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
In my mind

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
Something that happened the other day

36
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
On Alex's show

37
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,624
Episode wow we were alone I was alone you weren't on the show

38
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
For that

39
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
There was a something I'm sorry I had to go grab the clips

40
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Cuz I forgot to load it up

41
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,632
This triggered something in my brain

42
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Realize

43
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
We need to double back

44
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
You know sitting and thinking and having

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Something triggering your brain

46
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
That's how God,

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Buddhism

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
To really crack

49
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:11,744
No time until God

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,816
, rather than Hitler because that would solve the real

51
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Oh sure yeah

52
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
Great great I don't stand behind that but I do want to play this clip for you because I'm not sure

53
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Who's even listen to the episode

54
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
Question of it

55
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
Prove it I don't remember it goddamn well good cuz this is going to be

56
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
Fresh for you and maybe repetition

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
For people who let the

58
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,416
But it's still I will set the stage for we're going to be going on

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Call Brenda Georgia

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
And talk to Paul

61
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,304
Thanks for calling around here worldwide

62
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
That came on yesterday on

63
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
David Knight show

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,504
Las Vegas

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,583
Information campaign is he still working for the CIA

66
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,311
Anybody disagrees with Alex

67
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
That person is now a federal agent

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
Jump in bed with psych Warfare people

69
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Don't do it

70
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
So I heard that

71
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
Blue my mind

72
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Because

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,815
First of all that was news to me that's doesn't believe the Las Vegas shooting happen

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
It's crazy

75
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,687
But he does believe it happened

76
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
No Doubt

77
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Tap so I heard that clip

78
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
I was like I need to think about

79
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Pieczenik a little

80
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
I need to explore

81
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Him

82
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
Like Buddha

83
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
She was

84
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
In the game

85
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
At the end of 25

86
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Okay

87
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
Did that I never listen to David Knight show

88
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
What am I go back and listen

89
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
Actually saved Las Vegas

90
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Here are a couple clips

91
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,527
From the October 4th 2017

92
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Where Steve pieczenik comes on

93
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
And says with Las Vegas attack did not happen

94
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
Go straight to the shooting in Vegas

95
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
Number one why I

96
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,863
Can't get on the internet the reason is very simple I'm being hacked

97
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,191
The reason why you're hearing me now it's another person bumps

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
But why back 911

99
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,823
Anything you said David

100
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
The same thing I said within 24 hours of 9/11

101
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,759
My CIA operatives admitted that they did it I had the names of the people in

102
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
If you ever f****** names it's a continuation of 9/11

103
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
He says he has the names of all these people then I implore you sir

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,143
Let's get let's get on with it

105
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Let's get on with it because we need

106
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,103
I believe that the entire world security is contingent on you producing these f****** names

107
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Steve

108
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
911

109
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Painting

110
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Troodon

111
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
Giuliani

112
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,463
The Mossad operatives blew up the building and

113
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,047
And County and as well as cooling down

114
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
What's happening now

115
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,703
Anyways Sandy Hook false flag

116
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
San Bernardino false flag

117
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
Yesterday in

118
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Complete

119
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Set up as we had in Sandy Hook

120
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,671
Narrative is so predictable that no one was killed there was no shooting

121
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,255
In fact what happened in the giveaway what's this was the greatest

122
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
Chilling and all kind of America that's distinctive Trump

123
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
He has to have the most in the bed

124
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Parties that Trump Bell Angeles

125
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,079
Co-opted by the Department of Health

126
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,687
CIA and FBI what we need to do an Americanized Amman

127
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
Indictment of President indictment of officials

128
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
I don't know if it'll happen but this is enough

129
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
Reasons to start a revolution

130
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
That's crazy

131
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
He is

132
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
The most

133
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
Right ever for the

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:07,679
Bronx reason in the history of the world

135
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
F****** it starts with

136
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
What Reagan in the Iran-Contra

137
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
Scenario president since then

138
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Should have been put in

139
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
But f***

140
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Christ

141
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,903
Is he right

142
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Dally around with the idea that he's right because the part that he's wrong about more important

143
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Put

144
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
The part of me that was

145
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,031
Find a figure out a way

146
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
There is not

147
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
Stupid it seems

148
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Prohibitive

149
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
In terms of difficulty there's no doubt but it is fast

150
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Fascinating his line on it is

151
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Trump has gone South

152
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:08,607
He started doing.

153
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Revolution against Trump

154
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Because he

155
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
Fake the Las Vegas shooting

156
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
In order to have the largest

157
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Fakes

158
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:26,015
At what point because that is the craziest I've ever heard like

159
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
Keep in my head sort of the power ranking of my favorite crazy on Alex's show

160
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I know that photo up top where we're going to meet number to honor next episode

161
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,239
I went to go do a deep dive into this next crazy but

162
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,823
No he is just

163
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
Until we get through all this

164
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,783
Do you think

165
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,903
I like it deliberately like

166
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Yes okay

167
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
I think this is like Warfare

168
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Kirk Franklin

169
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
I also think he's a little bit crazy

170
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
There's no doubt about that

171
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Yeah

172
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
You heard him

173
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Still in 2017

174
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Sandy Hook was fake

175
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
And Alex

176
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
By virtue of

177
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
He's allowing this to be broadcast

178
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Operator

179
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
0 + 4

180
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Okay

181
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
All right and I wanted

182
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Get this out up front

183
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
That way the rest of the episode can prove me wrong but I had a good time

184
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
I think

185
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
That when Steve pieczenik live through a hurricane

186
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Okay

187
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Realize climate changes

188
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
And when

189
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
It broke his

190
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
Because he spent all of his time denying and now for the first time he's

191
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
He's confronted with reality

192
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
And his entire worldview breaks down so there's two ways to go

193
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
You can either change everything you think

194
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,575
Double down on your conspiracy

195
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
A continuation of your theory but if I leave

196
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,255
Climate change is real

197
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
You've got to do his part

198
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
To get Trump out of there so someone responsible with knows that the only place he

199
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
He has influence with be able to effect by making an

200
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,247
Even more insane Theory all right for them to get on board with and that is okay

201
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:40,415
Unfortunately it backfires cuz it says he's still working for the CIA

202
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Here's Steve talking more about how it was

203
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Still alive from goodnight

204
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
There was no death

205
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
No killings no shooter

206
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,407
Absolutely nothing

207
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Nothing

208
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
It was basically a total

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,343
A false flag it was a total Sandy Hook

210
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,903
I do not like the operation things

211
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:17,023
The expression it was a total Sandy Hook

212
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
That's grim

213
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,215
World now that is so beyond insane that I can't help but laugh

214
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
Lunatic

215
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,991
Blake Anderson

216
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Look if I did that on stage is a bit

217
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:46,975
The most ridiculous thing that you can possibly say

218
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Press

219
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
He said okay

220
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,847
David Knight the last clip

221
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,175
Yeah I want to be clear because I'm I'm saying goodnight

222
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
Steve pieczenik say the Sandy Hook didn't happen as evidence

223
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Also doesn't believe Sandy Hook happen

224
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,351
I mean look they intimidated Alex Jones and thinking that people really died in Sandy Hook

225
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Explain how that happened

226
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
Yeah I understand imitate it

227
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
I wouldn't disagree with you on

228
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Even more insane

229
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Look

230
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
If you believe

231
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Both were fake

232
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Certainly

233
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,119
Thursday

234
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,239
Series

235
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
Because then at least his sort of mental illness schizophrenic

236
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Break that he's having

237
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
Have clearly delineated line

238
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,527
Everything is fake

239
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,599
Because he's been so I don't think we can use this one

240
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
I think that if we say this is fake we're going to look real bad

241
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
People have started to pay attention to us

242
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:29,631
Under the radar and just make him scared

243
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
People

244
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
Late night shows make fun of us I don't want the world to find out who I am

245
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
People realize Owen Shroyer exist when he got

246
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Made fun of by a little girl

247
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
Finally saw his name

248
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:52,927
Imprint lawyer

249
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
It is

250
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:06,239
Shroyer is dangerously close to people knowing who he is

251
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Girl everyone just

252
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
They'll realize like

253
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
Is an integral part of Alex Jones is operation

254
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
And he's also a monster

255
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Skip to the end of this clip

256
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Determine exactly what happened

257
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
But I certainly

258
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
I believe that Sandy Hook was a full-blown false flag but I believe the people died here based on what I've seen

259
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
Witnesses to this event

260
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
So you just shut it down

261
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Sandy Hook

262
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
False flag

263
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,967
There were a lot of witnesses who saw this

264
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
A God damn

265
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Lick of sense

266
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,927
It's not good how many witnesses is enough Whitney

267
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Fact Witnesses

268
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
Blinds drawn

269
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,127
Can I listen to this

270
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
I was like

271
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
Is crazy

272
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Between which one it is

273
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
I think this is a more stringent we also reservation

274
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,559
Out there traffic is a really important part of Alex Jones is worldview and

275
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Is support for Trump

276
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
We know that

277
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Good enough job of

278
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,455
It's time

279
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Text Alex

280
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Wrestling with that

281
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Cuz running Edition

282
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,183
Information campaign would be at everyone's best

283
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Centrist

284
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
Explore the last two appearances

285
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Steve pieczenik

286
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,119
In December of 2015

287
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
May the train

288
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,775
Now on our last episode

289
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
To become

290
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Fully convinced

291
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Had to go with Trump

292
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
By the the last Republican

293
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
On December 5th

294
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Right

295
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,623
I picked it we're at our date off a tiny bit I think it was already fairly onboard

296
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
By then but

297
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Now I have no reservations

298
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
A day that will live in infamy

299
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
December 7th

300
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
2015

301
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
The anniversary

302
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Pearl Harbor

303
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Which is very fitting

304
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:52,127
They make an appearance on the December 7th

305
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
2015 show

306
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
It

307
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
This is

308
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
This is like the kind of stuff

309
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
That Alex

310
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
You get to watch him

311
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Throughout the rest of this episode

312
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
In real time

313
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
What's up

314
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Oh my God

315
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
Flags

316
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Still have

317
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,727
Right like the term comes from

318
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
That would put different flags on

319
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
To make the people who where you were going with someone else they would kill every

320
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Privateers

321
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
Yeah back whenever it was

322
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah

323
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
It like if 9/11 was a false flag

324
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
The tower still did go down

325
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,791
Didn't all get f****** mr. like

326
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,399
Mesmerised

327
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
You're not putting a giant

328
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,031
Okay is Men in Black 2

329
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
Argument

330
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
Rockstarz Buffalo

331
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,247
One of the things he's saying is

332
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
The target is the Moto

333
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
That's something

334
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
He keeps repeating over and over again

335
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
Christian conservatives

336
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Scooby stereotype in country music

337
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,815
They are the ones who wear the target obviously

338
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
The motive was wanted to kill white Christian

339
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
A conservative type

340
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
Okay

341
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,335
And he's making the argument that must mean that it's liberals

342
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Door behind

343
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,919
You're the antifa

344
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,015
They would want to kill Conservative Christian

345
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,831
And to that end I would make the argument

346
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
If you had a crazy conservative

347
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
Type and I'm not saying that this is

348
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
Crazy guy

349
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,143
Maybe someone who listens to Alex Jones and loves the idea false flags and understand

350
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
Blamed for certain thing

351
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,287
Wouldn't it make sense for that person then to target Veron

352
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
People

353
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
He says that the Democrats are going to do that

354
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
To gain sympathy

355
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,015
He says that the Democrats are going to start false flagging each other in order to blame the Patriots

356
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
2 using that same logic

357
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,951
Doesn't it make sense that he should consider the possibility that some unhinged militia person attack

358
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
That would appear to be white Christian conservative

359
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
In order to

360
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Jamie Dornan

361
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,191
I'm not using Alex Jones

362
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
That makes as much sense as anything he's saying

363
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Right

364
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Problem

365
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
It's crazy

366
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Batshit

367
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
Also

368
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
We live in a comic book now

369
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
So that might as well

370
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
In the world that we live in

371
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
I'm at a place where it's like

372
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
A year ago

373
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
That's f****** crazy dad now it's like 30 12% possibility that did happen

374
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Actually the way you described that I think it's Alex is like

375
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
You know he

376
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
Describes all sorts of Nefarious motives to one side and then doesn't think that people listening to me

377
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Might think

378
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
That's a good idea

379
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
I meant go do it

380
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
So the reason that

381
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,536
Again I'm not saying that's what happened like this

382
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Is obviously the true

383
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
If we just start going

384
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
Conspiracy theory Beyond Alex Jones

385
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,240
Sure

386
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
I was starting to flirt with the idea of pretending

387
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,688
For his dissertation doctorate

388
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,528
When I was growing up and I was super young we lived in Cambridge in Boston

389
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
Is doctorate in religious studies

390
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,720
Alternative fake

391
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
Reality we're actually there because

392
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
They were doing tests on me in order

393
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,776
Jesus I was thinking about trying to do something like that and the idea of you say we should go crazy

394
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
What's an idea

395
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Exceed

396
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
No

397
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,816
You're you're discounting the fact that if Alex didn't

398
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
That that's what

399
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Could have happened

400
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:29,888
And would have

401
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Then his job then

402
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
Pretend

403
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
That

404
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
And it couldn't be what

405
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:43,200
See what's going on then do I know

406
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
It's impossible to get

407
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
Nothing with with that is

408
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
True

409
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
We only make Alex smarter and

410
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,488
Smarter and smarter

411
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
We should be going the exact opposite

412
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:04,192
Get directions

413
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,312
I'll bet the first thing that I want to do is I want to play

414
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
2015 show

415
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,896
Always talks about

416
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Come out

417
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
Veterans United States funds

418
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Who's Isis

419
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
Realize

420
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,856
Exactly where he was getting this from any Mexico here in this clip

421
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
No problem

422
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,752
Blown up

423
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
I don't think the establishment

424
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,432
Television

425
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
Consciously

426
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,600
It's a horrible idea I don't know what

427
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
Do you know who that is

428
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
Michael Flynn

429
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
Of course

430
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
You know what

431
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
By the way I listen to that interview

432
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
Unwise

433
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Vet Mike Flynn

434
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
The guy who got

435
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Fired

436
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
From the Director of National Intelligence position

437
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Not good

438
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Currently working

439
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:29,184
Forever 21 at that point you making these claims

440
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
He's actively an agent for a foreign power

441
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
Cool dictatorship

442
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
I don't necessarily think that discount

443
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Interesting

444
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,984
Okay

445
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,360
So it is not beyond the realm of possibility to imagine that

446
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
We funded ice

447
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Entirely

448
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,528
Well before they were the Islamic State

449
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,160
Right before they were an entity that was International

450
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,048
Probably most likely

451
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:11,680
Different generation

452
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
It's a different time it's it's not like

453
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,080
It's not like we funded al-Qaeda in Uno 99

454
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
14000

455
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,176
They were fighting the Russian

456
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
Again it doesn't necessarily

457
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Discount what he

458
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Right

459
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
With that

460
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,928
But Alex says he's

461
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Right

462
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
And then there's also the fact that

463
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
We are

464
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Constantly making ice

465
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
Simply by having our dumbass

466
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
They are recruiting entirely baseball

467
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
At least it's not like they needed it Obama drone strike the hell out of enough

468
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,200
Recruitment plan

469
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
In effect

470
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
End up helping Isis

471
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,064
But that does not mean that we created Isis

472
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Channel 8

473
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
In the same way that like

474
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
Car or even a pill to some extent

475
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
There's a negative side effects

476
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Just found out that's going

477
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
To call

478
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
X amount of

479
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,520
Right I could either recall it or pay people off

480
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Businesses

481
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:28,480
Right they just decide that hey we're going to bite the bullet on this and just gets as opposed to settle out of court

482
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,784
2 Chainz

483
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
Probably foreign policy equivalent

484
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
We're going to kill a bunch of terrorists

485
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
Amor

486
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:45,632
I think it's I think there's probably an equation the people do and I disagree with her math probably but

487
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Nothing makes

488
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
The gun companies

489
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
More money than whenever a mass shooting

490
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,176
Bright socks got sold out immediately

491
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,528
Nothing makes military contractor

492
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
There's more money than

493
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,696
Yeah and nothing makes our GOP Congressman more electable than

494
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
Pretending that there

495
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Fighting against terrorists

496
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
Yeah they have to create

497
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
America

498
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,096
Create its own anime

499
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
But being f******

500
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
That is a big part of

501
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
That's what we are so ugh

502
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
I don't necessarily discount what Mike

503
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Michael Flynn

504
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
In that regard because

505
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
First off

506
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Who gives a s*** going to jail

507
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Probably

508
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,968
Have to know that at this point

509
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Seems about his goal is either.

510
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Parked

511
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
To f******

512
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
Go all-out right

513
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
So why not

514
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
And this isn't December 2015

515
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
We got to remember that we're back in

516
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,584
The past has been named

517
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Trump

518
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Nationals

519
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,752
Security guy or anything like that

520
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:59,872
Connections that have already been forming

521
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Right now

522
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:09,344
And I am not doing a good job covering it

523
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,184
You're like I should be in prison

524
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
International frogs

525
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,448
Let's put a pin in all that I get what you're saying

526
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
I don't just I don't disagree but I don't hold

527
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,776
Agree either

528
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,592
But it's immaterial to need to get through today

529
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Chinaq

530
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
He comes in this December 7th

531
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
2015 episode

532
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,320
Obama

533
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,392
Repeatedly our intelligence Community to stand up

534
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,720
Stop the president of the United States

535
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,256
Trainee Clinton

536
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Or Obama

537
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,840
Obama has been a disaster from day one

538
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,168
History has been nothing but a contrived

539
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
30 how about a CIA operative

540
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,080
Born of a CIA grandmother and mother

541
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,896
Grandfather who had no background

542
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
No experience whatsoever

543
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,528
Was voted in without any letting by the Secret Service

544
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
Napa security or any organization in the United States

545
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,160
You and I could not

546
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,976
I'm president of the United States the way Obama did

547
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
What did he do when he would have to be elected with you killing of a

548
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,168
Sama Bin Laden which never occurred

549
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,312
So literally everything she does not believe anything

550
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,872
Annihilus

551
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
We Believe

552
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
I may or just like a solid

553
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
He

554
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,368
In 2015

555
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
He has to know that

556
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Full of come

557
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Complete bulshit

558
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
On that one

559
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Like there's no way that he

560
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
He could even pull up any evidence

561
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
To support those dumbbells

562
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,680
Obama wasn't his nonsense

563
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,984
Complete not that he was already

564
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
He's been in government

565
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,640
Look Obama a good president

566
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
He was a

567
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
Absolutely

568
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
It's all yours up there without the r

569
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:21,440
You could make a very compelling argument that his

570
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
His response and his

571
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
So many things

572
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,864
Is the reason that we have

573
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
He was a

574
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,704
Huge proponent proponent of neoliberalism which has

575
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Destroyed the world

576
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
So

577
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,104
CIA operative

578
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
And pathetic wants are in

579
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Teligence community

580
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
To have more

581
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
I think so

582
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,648
You're a genius

583
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,512
They Don't Really unpack that idea that these

584
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Deep state

585
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
People

586
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,424
Should have control over that

587
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
The idea that we want our intelligence community

588
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
Is very scary

589
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,104
Consider how utterly incompetent

590
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Stupid they all are

591
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,176
If you think about

592
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
We

593
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,064
Should have probably killed Fidel Castro 60 time

594
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,112
And they failed every single

595
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Like with

596
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
With cartoonish

597
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,792
Bonvillain plant poisoning

598
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,096
Intelligent

599
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,144
It's more fun

600
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,288
Look all I'm saying is if Putin can kill people in the UK

601
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
Easily

602
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,384
Intelligence community

603
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,808
I don't have it I don't ever bottle to that I was just thinking it's probably easier

604
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,112
You to kill anybody anywhere

605
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,464
There better be idea that there

606
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Big smash

607
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:08,960
There's a difference there's a difference between like a dissident who's

608
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Country and a head of state

609
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
You mean an ambassador

610
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:16,640
Sure there's a difference between Ambassador and the president to whatever position

611
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Fidel Castro

612
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,504
I mean if you're killing people

613
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Security as say

614
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,416
Fidel Castro understand

615
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't know I still think it could be they're trying to bring in the idea of Las Vegas

616
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
Not that hard to pull off

617
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
You were secret clandestine organization

618
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,800
Really well look I'm not saying that that was the case cuz I don't believe it was

619
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
You were

620
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
Some sort of secret organization that has

621
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Unlimited funding

622
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
The idea of

623
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
The lone wolf killing

624
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Type of thing

625
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,600
Don't seem like it would be too hard to pull off

626
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
No

627
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,048
Back it was Bush and to the left

628
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:10,144
Who killed JFK

629
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
Conspiracy theory

630
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,568
Become vice president

631
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
CIA

632
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
That's true

633
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Pennywise

634
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
Steve pieczenik doesn't believe

635
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,392
He probably could have pulled it off

636
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Maybe he was in Copper

637
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
You're so frustrated with me

638
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,544
I like her I like a balance

639
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
I like having you here do you know to have conversation with but I don't f****** like every single thing

640
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,344
41

641
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
Pick any edgewise word you want but when I say in this next

642
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,072
Generally they say something

643
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Cuernavaca

644
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,168
I'm 35 minutes already

645
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,728
Alright I apologize

646
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
Next clip

647
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:25,152
We found out earlier that Steve pieczenik does not believe the Sandy Hook happen

648
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
3720

649
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Crazy nice States

650
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
Create it

651
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,880
Don only in Benghazi

652
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
Not only

653
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
And downtown oven on

654
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
Button Sandy Hook

655
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
I'm a Bin Laden kind of like a political John dumelo

656
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Anyway

657
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
Sandy Hook was par excellence

658
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,056
Description of a non-existent

659
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Killing

660
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
Show called Asperger's individual

661
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,944
Supposedly killed 22 kids

662
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Federal adult

663
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,344
A lot of Machinery in a lot of heavy equipment it was nonsense

664
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Moving along

665
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
Another one

666
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,616
Is because it becomes abundantly clear when you listen to this December 7th appearance

667
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
Listen to the December 20th

668
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Appearance

669
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
You really start

670
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
To get the

671
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,856
All the pieces coming to play about Steve

672
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Manipulating Alex

673
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
And there's a couple moments where Alex

674
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
I think he's

675
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
He's been through it a little bit

676
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
Squashes those

677
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Beers or like

678
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
Belfor

679
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,568
Pretended to go full-on with Sandy Hook

680
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
He's manipulating Alex

681
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
That's all you

682
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
He's just sowing chaos

683
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Horsemen of the Apocalypse

684
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:13,184
I think the populations are much easier to control when they're scared and when they are

685
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Distrustful of authority and that sort of thing

686
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Ain't So if you want

687
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
Mccreight book

688
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,120
And stuff like that

689
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
30 styles

690
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,936
I'm sure there's some

691
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
Interesting that but that also

692
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Just pushing through

693
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
You know what I don't know

694
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,920
Purely Financial motive

695
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
It doesn't

696
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Seem like

697
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
It's not clear he has a vested interest

698
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Trump getting

699
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
He doesn't seem like

700
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:49,536
He's not as much of a bigot is a lot of Alex's other cronies

701
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,608
What is he getting now that he would have gotten

702
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
Stolen Valor

703
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,496
A little bit so this is just him wanting to get a

704
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:03,616
Handjob mean if you're going to make the argument that you think he's crazy

705
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:09,248
He's crazy enough to just want everyone to think that he's changed the world

706
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
That could it could be just ego as it is about people like

707
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,256
Larry Nichols

708
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,304
Basically that's

709
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
The primary motivation

710
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
Noelle is not boring in terms of the Witch

711
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,312
Stuff but then there's other people who it's clear that like because it will

712
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
Ada rollback of civil rights

713
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
It will Aid a rollback

714
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Of taxes on the rich

715
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
And stuff like that

716
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
Divas

717
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:44,576
It's not it's clear I think you playing a really interesting

718
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Game

719
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
But yeah I don't know why

720
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,720
Why is not clear maybe maybe

721
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,768
Regardless of

722
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
He's going to get

723
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Some

724
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
The more he appears on these shows

725
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
Is it really just he wants

726
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Detention

727
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
Is he just another just another narcissistic

728
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,640
It's possible but I think also he might also be

729
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
Being manipulated

730
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
In some ways

731
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
As manipulated

732
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,552
Text but over the course of

733
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,600
I think you'll start to see little indication

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
Possible

735
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
That other characters we know are working

736
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
We talked about

737
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Manipulate

738
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,632
Rodger Stone

739
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
Now we're giving Rogers

740
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:39,872
Let's listen to a few more clips and see where we land that it's very difficult to say

741
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Exactly what

742
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,968
The motivation of the endgame is

743
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
I think it might be possible that we could sum it up as a drastic

744
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Change in US foreign policy

745
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,928
Okay and I think that you might have some

746
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
Softness towards Russia

747
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,816
You might be a pro-russia guy

748
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
It's entirely possible.

749
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
Piece of it I don't know let's play some of these parts

750
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
See if it develops

751
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Alright

752
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
And his next clip

753
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
Receive Justice

754
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Classic

755
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
Textile flattery

756
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
Indicative

757
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
Forget Alex

758
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Into a narrative

759
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
You need to listen

760
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Security with this

761
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Athleta

762
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
The American public you are important

763
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,584
Because basically you have been the game changer

764
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,936
The entire business is immediately

765
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
The New York Times

766
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
The Wall Street Journal

767
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Ratings

768
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
And to get money for whatever,

769
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,552
Your job what time is it

770
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,904
And thanks to your own intuitive

771
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Knowledge

772
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,048
Sense of righteousness he went on to say okay let me hear with your kind of guitar

773
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
And

774
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,656
Used tenured with it and in that sense to me

775
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
You represented the American public the public

776
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
People who worked hard

777
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,896
People who wanted jobs on a daily basis not

778
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,944
Politicians like Hillary

779
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
Are you saying that you have change

780
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Change the game

781
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
You are responsible for a change in the game

782
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,136
Because you're not like these assholes

783
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,464
You're the voice of the under

784
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
You are the voice of

785
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,792
Truamerica

786
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
Exactly what Alex wants

787
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,424
Exactly the sort of thing

788
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
He's a patriot

789
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
So you're taking some notes already got

790
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,544
I just like

791
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
Beauty in a certain sense

792
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,480
Actually

793
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Unfortunately

794
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,000
Drudge and all of those guys and of course after the BuzzFeed article that

795
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Once again proved

796
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,840
Milo yiannopoulos

797
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Which f******

798
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Yeah we got some

799
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Real blowback

800
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
Wonderly

801
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,568
3 what I say

802
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
Jordan one of Milo yiannopoulos has email passwords with kristallnacht

803
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,576
Or the other one was night of Long Knives 1920

804
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
Yeah I bet I bet

805
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,416
That's a long password

806
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,048
If we are going to direct

807
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Don't understand

808
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Absolutely

809
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,080
Tell him that everybody else is looking

810
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
To tell him that

811
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Because Alex

812
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
To believe that he is

813
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
Getting this money under duress

814
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
It always has

815
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
Have to be to keep the doors open

816
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,159
Right can't be because Alex is a multi

817
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
Play millionaire

818
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,743
It can't be because of that it has to be because he's a

819
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,303
Cuz that will fulfill his narrative

820
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
Pieczenik is doing that

821
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
On purpose

822
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
As opposed to

823
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
The net

824
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Daddy says

825
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
Has to be f****** insane

826
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Okay

827
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,503
And what happened is you allowed to Trump

828
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
To come in

829
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
Thanks to Mr Rodger Stone

830
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,135
I've known it bad since the Reagan Administration

831
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,951
And he was brilliant enough to say you know what

832
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
Wiccan illegitimate

833
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
People who've been out

834
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,351
Call the Troopers in the wackos

835
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
20 million of us

836
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
Basically are saying

837
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Plush

838
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
Change

839
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,639
Drawing your criminal

840
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
How much

841
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,647
He's really really great

842
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Did you notice where he's like

843
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,303
I didn't know that you knew Stone

844
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,887
Steve is like

845
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:23,263
Now I don't know him personally

846
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,079
Since the Reagan Administration

847
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
And that record starting

848
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,479
2 in this clip you starting to realize that Alex is starting

849
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,759
Some pieces together and he needs

850
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
What's the distance himself from Rodger Stone

851
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
Because

852
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,367
The two of them

853
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,903
Are playing Alex

854
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
From different angles

855
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
That's clearly what's happening

856
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Okay

857
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,143
Working in concert

858
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Suspect that

859
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
If he does

860
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
Then he'll realize that they're f****** with

861
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
Okay I know that to be admitted it since then

862
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Yeah but that was

863
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
Real

864
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
It's a thing that Rodger Stone and Steve pieczenik

865
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
Who knows what other people

866
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:23,679
Auto part of strategize

867
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
So obviously Rodger Stone

868
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Steve pieczenik

869
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,383
Do know each other at this point if that's possible that's not the case

870
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663
I'm making

871
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,991
Summer sershon that are based on some of the later Clips to

872
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
Right. Don't like

873
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,367
You don't push back too hard but at the same time

874
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
I understand your critiques

875
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
And their Fair

876
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,559
Will you know I'm always going to come from the Occam's razor

877
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,423
Simpler explanation of them know each other

878
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
More about the coordinator

879
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,287
Waverly let's finish this club

880
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
And stone was basically

881
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,903
None of them would ever perfect

882
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
Realize

883
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,535
If we don't turn things around and stop

884
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Select

885
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
I agree with you

886
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
Took

887
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:32,799
Where we get the word of that you're just like

888
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:38,687
No the only the only thing you concerned about cuz immediately what he says after that is

889
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,503
Did that he's concerned about is

890
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
Fat pushing back against that

891
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,855
Cuz what you heard they're at the end of that clip

892
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Alex talking

893
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Is something you will revisit later

894
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
And it is a realization

895
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,511
Did Rodger Stone behind the scenes

896
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Has been telling him

897
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
Verbatim

898
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,351
The same stuff Steve pieczenik

899
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,119
Telling him

900
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,959
Indicate

901
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Coordination

902
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Set

903
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
Compelling

904
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
We just saw it right there

905
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Is

906
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
The temperature

907
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,503
He's been a long time

908
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
Rodger Stone his not

909
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
Rodger Stone was a part of the Trump campaign

910
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
August 20th

911
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
In order to

912
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
A Groundswell

913
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Supposedly not connected

914
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
Did the Trump media attention

915
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,983
Yeah I mean

916
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Heart attack

917
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
So what does

918
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Have connection

919
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
With Steve pieczenik

920
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,479
I need to work together if we're going to flip

921
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Alex Jones

922
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
Right we're going to get him on board

923
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Months before this

924
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
This December

925
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,463
Episode he came on and said that me and some other people

926
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Have convinced

927
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
Trump to run for president

928
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,071
Because he is the one who can save the country

929
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
A couple months ago

930
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
In Alex's house

931
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
Because

932
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
Interactions that he's had with Rodger Stone

933
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
The people that he's talking to behind the scene

934
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,079
Rodger Stone

935
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,407
And ostensibly other people who are members of this 45 group

936
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
That is my belief

937
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
Ozon

938
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
And I imagine

939
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,367
You know Steve pieczenik is spitting the narratives that Rodger Stone will

940
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
End up staying

941
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,487
What's he shows up Rodger Stone shows up

942
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,559
Exact same things that trusted

943
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
Pertronix

944
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Be true

945
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,007
You guys can't be connected you say you don't know each other when in the meantime

946
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
It's just a perfectly elaborate

947
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Perfectly laid out charade

948
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Loudoun 2017

949
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Has collapsed

950
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Because Steve pieczenik

951
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,479
I said that

952
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
Las Vegas shooting

953
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:55,647
Because or they're not

954
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
I suppose it's just

955
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,279
I see these two guys as

956
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Is being

957
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Stupid

958
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,399
Can successfully pull off

959
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
This scam

960
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
What's stupid about

961
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Stupid about the

962
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
Listen to what they say

963
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,919
No cuz there's intent behind the things

964
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
It sounds stupid

965
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
That's the thing that says

966
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
To be taking it again

967
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Consideration

968
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:26,879
Like if you are I said it or if you walk down the street and you saw some guy in like a

969
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
The information is not stupid they're doing it for a reason

970
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
Propaganda

971
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
And conspiracy theorist

972
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Very rarely

973
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,727
Exist in a vacuum

974
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,335
No they're not they're not espousing to dumb theories that they espoused

975
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,663
For no reason there's something behind all of this

976
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Kahneman

977
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,063
So April like are they and cummings motivation

978
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,487
Doing this for some sort of

979
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,911
America

980
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Right

981
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:16,543
So you always presented as I care about the country yet

982
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
Do they want Power do they want influence do they want money

983
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
Probably do they look like and how does this

984
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Help them

985
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,527
This is what I don't understand

986
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,975
No I think school is for people to look at him

987
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
And say look at

988
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
He got a tattoo

989
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Nixon

990
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
I think that's a big part of it but you have to

991
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Consider that

992
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,751
You know he's been in business with Paul manafort is Broderick

993
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,335
Slips in there he's been involved in third world country election

994
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
He has

995
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
He has

996
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
That are not abundant

997
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
Clear without digging too deep into that

998
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
I think that

999
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Probably they all stand to gain

1000
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
An amazing amount of money

1001
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
Wicker Trump being president

1002
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,999
They all know that they can use it

1003
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
Convoluted

1004
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
Rube Goldberg machine of making money

1005
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,215
Well maybe some of them had their backs

1006
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
The wall

1007
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
Maybe there was no other option

1008
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,871
People like Mike Flynn probably didn't have another option

1009
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,919
Right people like Paul manafort

1010
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
In over his head

1011
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Probably didn't have another option

1012
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,063
I don't I don't

1013
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,623
There's so many other options

1014
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,719
They already have

1015
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,023
Influence

1016
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,143
Name recognition of billions of dollars to a foreign powers

1017
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
That wants their money back

1018
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,703
What do you do

1019
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,775
You can influence trade in order to get your debt

1020
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,847
Forgiven before does

1021
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,711
There was an article that came out recently about how

1022
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,039
Did the

1023
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,111
The prevailing theory is because

1024
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
Money

1025
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,767
Aubrey was involved with that.

1026
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Director

1027
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,839
Guy I can remember how to say that Russia

1028
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,679
The emails showed that he was offering

1029
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Private briefing

1030
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,543
And the prevailing theory was that money is super easy to

1031
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
You traced

1032
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
And so he was offering these

1033
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,639
These things in exchange for debt forgiveness

1034
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
Because that would be

1035
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
Impossible to trace

1036
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
Situations like that

1037
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
Status

1038
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,135
Steve pieczenik I don't know what he has his fingers in

1039
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,207
But you have to assume with a lot of these

1040
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
These people

1041
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
That is what's going on

1042
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
They're desperate

1043
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
Hard for me to jump

1044
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
Full force into this because again it's

1045
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
It sounds like a f******

1046
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Comic book

1047
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,543
Like this does not sound like it would happen in reality

1048
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,615
Trump is

1049
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
Who knows what could happen

1050
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,759
It's it seems just so insane

1051
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Actually happened in real life

1052
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Just because

1053
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
At the same time

1054
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Guy seems so

1055
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:16,511
They're amazing or they're terrible

1056
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
There's no there's no middle ground with

1057
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
He's f****** idiot

1058
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Bright

1059
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,191
So here's the article about Paul manafort

1060
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,615
We now know more about why manafort offered private briefings to Russian oligarch

1061
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,735
Paul manafort offered private briefings to Russian oligarch

1062
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Resolving a business

1063
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
Dispute a new report says

1064
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,879
The dispute erupted as a result of a failed 2008 business

1065
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,743
Manafort representative City offer private briefings never materialized which is irrelevant

1066
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
Former Trump campaign chairman Paul manafort offered private briefings

1067
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
About the campaign for Russian oligarch

1068
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,727
Deripaska

1069
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
In hopes of resolving a years-long business

1070
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Sources told Bloomberg on Wednesday

1071
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:06,175
Failed business deal in 2008 involving

1072
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
Ukrainian TV company

1073
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
Call Black

1074
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
C cable

1075
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
According to Bloomberg

1076
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,343
Legal complaints filed by deripaska representative

1077
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
In the Cayman Islands

1078
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
2014

1079
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
18 billion dollars

1080
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
Invest in the company but

1081
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
Project fell through

1082
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
Amana Fort all but

1083
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
Appear without paying back deripaska

1084
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:31,007
And pledging to recover the money from him as recently as early 2006

1085
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
According to the Associated Press

1086
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,615
But they reportedly backed off on accusations

1087
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Shortly after manafort's

1088
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Campaign display

1089
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:41,759
Do you have situations like this pretty open-and-shut.

1090
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
Or at least it

1091
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
F******

1092
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
You need a good excuse if it's not

1093
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Obviously

1094
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,535
Write any other conclusion is outside

1095
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:59,167
It would be baffling another conclusion we have these things that are starting

1096
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
To come up

1097
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Who knows

1098
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
I'd like I said

1099
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
No.

1100
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
Game in it

1101
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,919
I don't know exactly what Rodger Stone

1102
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,199
Right but there are

1103
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,271
Sleep the lifting of sanctions

1104
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:18,111
Billions of dollars

1105
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,159
End

1106
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
They couldn't

1107
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Piece of that

1108
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
Possible

1109
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Or just

1110
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
I mean

1111
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
Pretty clear to me based on Steve pieczenik

1112
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
Things that you said

1113
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
He has a soft spot for Russia and like

1114
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,031
Makes them being able to work with them more

1115
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,359
What is not being illegal

1116
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,455
I don't know but can we stop on board with a global

1117
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,295
Whenever were fighting against a global conspiracy

1118
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,135
I don't think it's probably for European very localized

1119
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Very localized

1120
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
Open is just part of another larger

1121
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,583
Like if you're going to say if you're going to say that

1122
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Are both

1123
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,423
Manipulating Alex

1124
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,959
In coordination with each other

1125
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
Then you have to get into the large

1126
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
445

1127
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,847
Do they all know about

1128
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,383
45 members

1129
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Alright

1130
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,903
The Crazy 88

1131
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,487
So then you have to say that well that entire group is probably

1132
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
At the very least had a

1133
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Conversation about

1134
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,631
Or they purported are probably in there too

1135
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:39,007
So now you have phlegm also with multiple different

1136
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,287
Commence

1137
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,687
Dealing with global conspiracy you're not

1138
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,479
Successful

1139
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,039
Globalist

1140
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
Conspiracy that Alex

1141
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
Because involved

1142
00:55:54,367 --> 00:56:00,511
You know like poisoning the water

1143
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:05,375
And this is just making a motivation is very

1144
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
Clearly just

1145
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,191
Selfishness and self

1146
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
Empowerment yeah

1147
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
Is a global conspiracy

1148
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
Is based entirely on that makes

1149
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,175
More sense than otherwise

1150
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
Is it really that easy

1151
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,527
What it's very frustrating

1152
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:28,415
Is that what you can do

1153
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,255
If you get enough to do if you get enough connections is it all the sudden like

1154
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,303
Hey let's make a billion dollars off

1155
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Sanctions

1156
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:40,959
Lifting by electing the worst president in the history of the world

1157
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
We couldn't possibly have done

1158
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,847
Barely happened in the first place and a couple of other flaming bigots

1159
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:52,223
So we'll just distract everybody with all sorts of birth-control and out lawn

1160
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
520 week abortion

1161
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
S*** like that

1162
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,623
We'll get everyone hot and bothered and distracted with that well we

1163
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
Rake in millions

1164
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,719
And then the door have our Millions

1165
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
Forgiven in death

1166
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
That motive in there it has to

1167
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
Movie desperation

1168
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
Tattoo of Ben askren

1169
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,591
Imagine if our media actually function even slightly

1170
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,895
But that's part of your calculation

1171
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Right

1172
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
A little bit

1173
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,551
If they've given the if they've given Trump

1174
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:31,391
Billion in free advertising instead of 2 billion in free advertise

1175
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,183
Would we still be in the same play

1176
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
I don't know I probably

1177
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
I think so

1178
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Do you think it was inevitable

1179
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
Unexso probably

1180
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,911
From

1181
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
It was inevitable

1182
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Maybe

1183
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:53,663
I think we'll know more as time goes on

1184
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,991
Yeah I mean in terms of

1185
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
Cambridge analytica

1186
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
In terms of the micro-targeting of people with ads

1187
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,647
Yeah her movies Russian companies buying

1188
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
Weird ads

1189
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Have to do with art

1190
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,511
Domestic issues who Woulda guessed trying to

1191
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,863
You got caught people to be racist

1192
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Ford strop

1193
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
Howard to get them towards drop by and slamming it

1194
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:21,311
I think it's a lot of those things make it much more inevitable

1195
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
Certainly wasn't

1196
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
People could have fought back against it more effect

1197
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Actively fight

1198
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
Yeah I just don't like

1199
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
I don't like that narrative

1200
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Because that is

1201
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
That is the

1202
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
The people with information

1203
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
Defeating the people

1204
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Without it

1205
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
Is the people

1206
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,375
Insanely rich

1207
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
Effective

1208
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,823
Target propaganda campaign that I just don't want to believe that

1209
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
People are good at some

1210
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
Rodger stone is one of the sleaziest

1211
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,575
Players in the game B's the Ric Flair

1212
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,391
He is dirty as hell and

1213
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,951
What why would you not sink

1214
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:14,559
That would be his modus operandi

1215
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
Pulling off something really f***** up

1216
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
And sleazy

1217
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,191
Is exactly what he's all about

1218
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:25,311
Like I know that he and Trump have been friends for a long time and all that and plain sort of his

1219
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
Proximity

1220
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
But his involvement

1221
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,223
Is actively involved

1222
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
Dolphin

1223
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,367
If I'm if I'm going to do a an autopsy

1224
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,415
My first

1225
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
First

1226
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Kill

1227
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,815
I mean my first like suspect

1228
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
The prime mover

1229
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
So to speak

1230
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Is

1231
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,679
Mercer

1232
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,727
I think this will go down and

1233
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
First time

1234
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
That artist

1235
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Social intelligence

1236
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
BBQ man

1237
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
Blue

1238
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:10,111
Artificial intelligence improvised in that regard but I do I do think that

1239
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
Cambridge analytica is the

1240
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,975
Secret

1241
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
One of the biggest

1242
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Pieces on the map

1243
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
Behind all sorts

1244
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
Yeah

1245
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,911
Like this but at the same time

1246
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,703
I wouldn't

1247
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
I would not put it past

1248
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
The

1249
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,103
Do you have that the 45 group might even be affiliated with him

1250
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,503
Robert Mercer

1251
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,551
Mercer is

1252
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
Behind everything out

1253
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,719
I do have the inklings of an episode of Doctor Who

1254
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
Mercer

1255
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
Is actually just a robot

1256
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,071
Who is being controlled by the silo

1257
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:56,447
BuzzFeed article about

1258
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
The emails

1259
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,287
Leaks from Breitbart

1260
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,079
Milo yiannopoulos

1261
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
His connection

1262
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:09,503
Supremacist sources

1263
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Tent

1264
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
And a handsome

1265
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,671
Campaign put those two together and realize that they're the same people

1266
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,975
Consider that they are working

1267
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,255
Allegiance

1268
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,559
Edit concert without

1269
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
Infowars

1270
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
It's just

1271
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
Slightly disconnected

1272
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Because I mean look at it

1273
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
Milo's come on out

1274
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,007
What's the show that they're friends

1275
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,567
He loves Bannon

1276
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
The genius

1277
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,943
On a recent episode he's talking about how the fourth turn is coming that's a big piece of

1278
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
All of this is connected with the whole like Global conspiracies are dumb and now I'm right in the play

1279
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
All of these all of these Outlets

1280
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,767
All of these

1281
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
Media Outlets

1282
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
Connected

1283
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
In creating this Loop

1284
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,935
And they're all funded by

1285
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Rich old white billion

1286
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
And Betsy DeVos

1287
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,383
Sure I hope she dies

1288
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
I really hope

1289
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,735
Delete

1290
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:21,439
We lost track of that was really important is that

1291
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,231
Technos that Alex Jones

1292
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
Got information from

1293
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,375
Rodger Stone and Rodger and Rodger Stone

1294
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,911
Him

1295
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,983
There's no indication that he should know that

1296
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
Alex's never said that on air

1297
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Nobody knows

1298
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,247
Suggest that Rodger has told so little

1299
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,063
So now we are up Alex

1300
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
Decided by you

1301
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,207
Flattered

1302
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,487
He does something very

1303
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
Tensional and I will talk about

1304
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,631
This cannot continue if we do not have a Congress and President

1305
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
For a military and intelligence

1306
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
Viable

1307
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
I'm concerned about a national security

1308
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,103
And that's where America has to have the American Revolution

1309
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
In a way that's

1310
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
Struct

1311
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,711
Why you are important

1312
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,503
And why Trump was important

1313
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:22,111
If you want the game-changer you are the expression that American Revolution

1314
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
21st century

1315
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,207
Allow the truth to come out

1316
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
Saint Augustine said don't worry about the truth

1317
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,839
Let it do what it does best to destroy those

1318
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
What's the truth

1319
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,055
It's important than Trump was import

1320
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
Using the past tense

1321
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,431
The other thing is

1322
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Inexorably

1323
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Ty's Alex

1324
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
And Trump together

1325
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
Lesbian

1326
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,063
The forces of this new Revolution

1327
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,135
So at this point Alex is still not really

1328
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,695
Ricky hasn't come out gung-ho for truck

1329
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Right

1330
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
It's putting the two of them

1331
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Together as being

1332
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Proponents of this

1333
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
American

1334
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
Put into Alex

1335
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,263
We are of the same

1336
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,591
Yeah yeah

1337
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,151
I mean like December 1st to 2050

1338
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
Trump came on his show

1339
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,295
7 days

1340
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
Before

1341
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
December 2nd

1342
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Auntie came on

1343
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
December 1st

1344
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:34,559
On the show he's talking about tomorrow

1345
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
The 3rd

1346
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,655
He goes so far as

1347
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
Still say that you love

1348
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
And Paul is fourth ramp

1349
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,847
But that Trump is okay

1350
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,383
4 days before this

1351
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,919
He's still saying

1352
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
Could been on

1353
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
He didn't go full-on

1354
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,511
Steve is needing to connect them even further in order for this to really exist

1355
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Get home

1356
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,863
And that's that's the job he's doing on this

1357
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
Episode

1358
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,703
He's tying them together your Fates are entwined

1359
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,543
You are the game changer that will help bring the American Revolution

1360
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
That's f***** up

1361
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
It really hard to

1362
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Like

1363
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,175
Hard to hear that and be like

1364
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,247
Can't do it what's really interesting to me about that

1365
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,575
Is it seems as though everybody

1366
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Everybody fights

1367
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,159
Everybody who's trying to

1368
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
To influence things and everybody who is looking things

1369
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
From a

1370
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
You know

1371
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
I don't know if you want to save it

1372
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
Pieczenik is ration

1373
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,471
He is making the same point

1374
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
That I would be making

1375
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
From a different

1376
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Perspective but

1377
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:52,895
The system is utterly and completely broke

1378
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,687
Yes it is destroying every

1379
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,503
So his his point is

1380
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,807
We need to destroy the system in rebuild

1381
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,623
His motive

1382
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,439
Then the only the only

1383
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
Prince between he and I

1384
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Is

1385
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:08,767
Spectrum

1386
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
I think the system needs to be broken down and rebuilt

1387
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
In order to

1388
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887
Benefits

1389
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
The poorest

1390
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
And he disagrees

1391
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:18,751
He thinks it needs to be broken down and rebuild

1392
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
Benefit

1393
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Only

1394
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
So

1395
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,175
Those people

1396
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,991
Is that it is already

1397
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:34,623
So what is it that he wants to how is it that you can break down and rebuild the system

1398
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
To benefit the rich even more other than

1399
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,975
Creating a new feudal society

1400
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
I think.

1401
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
We all know Larry Nichols

1402
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,031
Become a Duke he was actually bluffing

1403
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Sofia Richie

1404
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
You become a Duke

1405
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
He wants to become a vassal

1406
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Right

1407
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
I don't know

1408
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
Except to say

1409
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,759
His next court the last one we got from December 7th

1410
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
Again the day that will live in infamy

1411
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Alex almost

1412
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,879
Realize that he's being f*****

1413
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
The almost realizes

1414
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,767
See if you can give me the high sign if you can tell where Alex

1415
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Almost to get

1416
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
And then

1417
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,215
Response

1418
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:28,127
He said

1419
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,287
Stories

1420
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,335
Ouch

1421
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,199
Because

1422
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
This particular

1423
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,319
The fishing rod

1424
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:11,135
Was somewhat successful successful

1425
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,999
Good to let them know that

1426
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,047
Okay

1427
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
I'm just your common sense

1428
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:52,095
The world's greatest dirty Trickster

1429
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,727
Credibility

1430
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,591
Beyond The Pale of reality like legitimately Steve pieczenik ends up saying

1431
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,615
Donald Trump

1432
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
Just

1433
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,687
How to become president to straighten things out

1434
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:13,087
Adventures going to disappear

1435
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,879
President

1436
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:22,559
Loki and the Oracle are together

1437
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:27,167
Complete b******* right there Alex's like

1438
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:38,943
Come on better to right there

1439
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,503
Music making app

1440
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,807
You processing it right

1441
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,599
Finish the job like

1442
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
On the show

1443
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
I'm at if if

1444
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
At that moment

1445
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:05,055
Stingrays operation in quotes

1446
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,127
Like at this point

1447
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,943
Pieczenik might as well say that Las Vegas

1448
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,063
I've never been there I can't prove it's real could have been

1449
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
Could have been race memory

1450
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,999
They could have built it just so when I showed up there like a lot of people

1451
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,679
December 20th

1452
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,959
Where's Steve pieczenik

1453
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
He's back

1454
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
There's going to be two things

1455
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
The 29th

1456
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Already

1457
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:41,919
We missed

1458
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,687
Some things

1459
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
Christmas

1460
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Certainly it's coming up

1461
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
Or just happened

1462
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Whoops

1463
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
What happened

1464
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,439
Christmas

1465
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Course

1466
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
The war on Chris

1467
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:59,327
Christmas episode

1468
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:05,727
I don't think so. Eve episode which were going to come over later

1469
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
Anything

1470
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,031
Hear them

1471
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,055
Try and

1472
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:16,991
What about

1473
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,551
I'm right now

1474
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,183
The Muppets Christmas album but replace John Denver with Alex

1475
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:29,535
That would be amazing

1476
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
To do a lively

1477
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,119
I want them to do a live reading of A Christmas Carol

1478
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,959
Just rewrite it as they see how that would work like

1479
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
This motherfukers

1480
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:48,991
Personal private property

1481
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
Conservative Christmas Carol

1482
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,927
Libertarian

1483
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:03,327
Shotgun out be like Intruder and shoot the ghost in that would be the end

1484
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,143
Episode

1485
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Sure

1486
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,727
I just supposed to

1487
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:19,199
And all is well

1488
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
Constitution

1489
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:40,703
University

1490
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,567
Cowboys

1491
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,871
Smelter 55

1492
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,639
Safe and

1493
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
The real liberal

1494
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,111
Right is classical liberal

1495
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
Classical

1496
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
So let's get to it

1497
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,695
Steve pieczenik comes back on

1498
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
29th episode

1499
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
At this point

1500
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,327
Transform

1501
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
Music

1502
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,911
Yeah those we saw on December 5th

1503
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Absolutely

1504
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:17,823
I tracked it down

1505
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,943
Okay so now it's watching Alex

1506
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,735
And not realize

1507
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,783
How hard you getting played

1508
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,319
You'll see it all

1509
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
You'll see the moment

1510
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:30,879
This is sad

1511
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
Is really f****** sad

1512
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:37,023
We have had a military-to-military relationship with the Russian

1513
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,559
It has been outstanding

1514
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,839
It's 91

1515
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,423
Anil Kant contrary the narratives of

1516
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
Billions would like

1517
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
To say they bombed the Russian

1518
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
What's a Russian

1519
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:51,871
A conspiracy that's absolutely

1520
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,927
Literally the best

1521
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:11,583
So at this point in code is B

1522
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,887
Knows damn well

1523
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,935
Connections to Russia

1524
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Inoculate

1525
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:24,639
Oh yeah of course they're going to be attacking Russia secretly because

1526
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
2001 because of 911

1527
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
You said 91

1528
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
Advance that like

1529
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
It's already inclined to believe

1530
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
That just doesn't make any

1531
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
What do you mean

1532
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
I mean everything

1533
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
Point-by-point

1534
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,567
Are you saying that

1535
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,383
Military

1536
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,407
Cooperation

1537
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,223
The Russian military in our military

1538
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:08,159
Assad had a trilateral agreement with our military

1539
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,183
You know where that comes from

1540
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
Let's finish this quote

1541
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,999
You'll see where it comes from

1542
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,375
You have to understand I mean

1543
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,191
When I work in government

1544
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,775
My primary position was always as a military officer

1545
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
When I went into intelligence

1546
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,359
Random at MIT

1547
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,967
That was a secondary position but I was proud to be an

1548
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
Cours de Miami

1549
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Psychiatrist

1550
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
My loyalty has always been to the Republic as as it has been for Martin Dempsey as

1551
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,695
Expensive

1552
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
General Flynn

1553
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:52,191
And understood that our civilian leaders remember most of them have not been to war

1554
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,983
So a lot of these ideas

1555
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
For people like

1556
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
Michael Flynn

1557
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,407
So he went to the military officer

1558
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Right

1559
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,223
Then he went to MIT and Harvard in

1560
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
I guess so yeah

1561
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
He's a psychiatrist

1562
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,719
It does

1563
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:18,303
Cointelpro G like what is going on

1564
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,375
Community based on what we're getting from this

1565
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:30,079
I don't I think you got to get recruited

1566
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:36,223
You think so or it doesn't exist and you pretended

1567
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,527
That's another good with specified.

1568
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
F****** crazy

1569
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:46,975
Free Wild

1570
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,511
This would make a great

1571
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:53,375
One day it will be

1572
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:59,519
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy except it's real and we won't let go

1573
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,567
And one of the biggest mouse

1574
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
Piece of it is often drunk on there

1575
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:11,295
Evader toria's big it feel like to have the taste of whiskey so

1576
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,415
Counter-coup narrative

1577
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,255
Mentioned

1578
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,839
2 is I guess Hillary

1579
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
Taking

1580
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
Empower

1581
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,679
Or something like that and then the counter

1582
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,703
Sakura's what's deep

1583
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
Chaneques involve

1584
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
Huge basically military

1585
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,271
Civilian

1586
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:47,391
Slot machines

1587
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,439
Trying to conquer

1588
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,911
Neocon

1589
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,703
The authorization

1590
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:09,919
Disturbing

1591
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,271
Bottle

1592
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
Let me put it this way

1593
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,671
I would call this a we call this a soft coup

1594
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:26,047
Coon meaning that we haven't overthrown the president we don't intend to overthrow the present

1595
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Violence involved

1596
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,655
You're not going to be guns in the street

1597
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Bart Allen

1598
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
The same way you changed

1599
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,519
The Narrative of the media

1600
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:41,407
What's happening now thanks for The Bravery these men who've been in our military and our Navy

1601
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,479
The man who was fired in Benghazi

1602
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,575
Stand-down in africom in the naval officer too involved

1603
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,903
These people stood up and have their

1604
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,719
Stay in court and continue to have that

1605
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,511
Summer Harris Summer

1606
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,863
Remember our democracy in our Republic

1607
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,519
Military

1608
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,079
Systemwide saying no to the tyranny

1609
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:19,551
And what happened is because of your ability to articulate

1610
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:25,951
Lady in our military willing to stand up

1611
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,935
We're not bragging here basically saying because of that narrative

1612
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,471
You have a man like Trump

1613
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,287
Whatever he may or may not be

1614
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,103
He is changing the entire Dynamics

1615
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,919
Of the Republic and the way they getting elected

1616
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,735
Excuse me

1617
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
Steve

1618
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,831
You can keep blowing me but don't stick your finger up my ass

1619
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,879
He's not on air

1620
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Yeah

1621
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
Essentially saying

1622
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,047
Because of you and your

1623
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,863
You have created Trump

1624
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,911
Trump well God dammit

1625
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Right

1626
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,775
Andy's images already jumped on board at this point

1627
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
It's more

1628
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,104
Aggrandizing Alex

1629
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
Compromising

1630
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,152
Flattery

1631
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
What is a guy likes

1632
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
Like I said

1633
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,416
Day today

1634
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,744
Nobody likes to I don't know you lived in Florida

1635
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
Golf

1636
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
I don't know

1637
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,096
Is a retired dude I don't know what he does

1638
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:43,776
Text

1639
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:48,128
The f****** office just dreams upon dreams of possible like

1640
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,464
This b*******

1641
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,608
We are having any trouble as long as you keep being like you're the most important person in the world you're so amazing

1642
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,472
He's never going to push too hard back on

1643
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
Right

1644
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
If a person like Steve

1645
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:21,152
When this falling out about the Las Vegas thing happened it didn't even happen with Alex

1646
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
Admiral David Knight

1647
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,248
Alex's show I don't know

1648
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,296
Right

1649
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,112
Respond

1650
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
I'm about it

1651
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,672
Put in the hot

1652
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
I don't know what

1653
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
Urban light

1654
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,936
Yeah probably commercial buttons

1655
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,776
I don't know what you talked about

1656
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,824
Whenever

1657
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,224
Who was it that brought it up and they went immediately to commercial

1658
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,784
Pull that s*** up and Alex Jones like

1659
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,184
Volkswagen is really good at that

1660
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,024
Geico commercial

1661
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,816
So

1662
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Steve fakes

1663
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,144
His phone being f***** with

1664
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,424
Vicodin

1665
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,704
Tradition on Infowars

1666
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
I think that you

1667
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,920
You can pretty well assume that Rogerstown

1668
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
And Steve pieczenik are working to

1669
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,248
I think it comes out

1670
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:34,112
Don't the crooks

1671
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Because

1672
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,560
You see I'm getting into filled with right now

1673
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,144
Play Jammin me on this phone

1674
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,216
Paranoid I just know it

1675
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,264
To hear that

1676
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,872
Or not real

1677
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
This is an undisclosed number

1678
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,992
Paraprofessional

1679
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,856
Experience Obama is created

1680
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,648
Developed and nurtured by the

1681
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,440
DIA

1682
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,232
Chinaman

1683
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,768
Strategy

1684
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,072
Simple man not a great thinker

1685
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,632
The man has been told what to do

1686
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,984
Pathologically in a way that absolutely

1687
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,824
Like he wasn't the most

1688
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,360
Honest man I've ever met

1689
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,968
Obama has repeatedly lied about

1690
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,856
Posite Pro pictures

1691
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,232
Mr. stone with the Trump came

1692
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,680
Crab

1693
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
Timeout right there

1694
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
Steve pieczenik

1695
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,032
Response to that is

1696
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
Correct

1697
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,848
He's out of it slow

1698
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,152
Steve pieczenik knows what's going on

1699
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Okay

1700
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
Presupposes that

1701
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
Stonehenge

1702
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,344
He's basically running the campaign

1703
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,952
That means a lot of other reasons

1704
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,744
Alex knows the reason

1705
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,584
I can be more effective outside than inside

1706
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,608
Of course or whatever

1707
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Just b*******

1708
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,728
Steve if you have some awareness

1709
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,520
Instinctual response would not be

1710
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,288
Respond

1711
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
Factory response

1712
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
Correct

1713
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
Leave me to believe

1714
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Okay

1715
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,992
I have

1716
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,272
I have to

1717
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,552
The worst

1718
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
Stone

1719
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,208
Entirely possible Stone left because Stone

1720
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,024
Is the worst person to have affiliated

1721
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
With your ass

1722
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,608
And they wanted him

1723
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Possibly

1724
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
Still a possibility

1725
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:59,008
And it's entirely possible that I don't buy that although

1726
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Insist

1727
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
He's still running

1728
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
Because he's Rodger f******

1729
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,408
Stone he has two at the very least

1730
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
In the same way that somebody

1731
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
Kicked out of it

1732
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,576
The fifth Beatle is still like I'm big reason

1733
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600
In the Beatles were successful

1734
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Do you know that

1735
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,488
Results

1736
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,816
The same it doesn't matter you're acting like a little bit of nuance

1737
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:24,096
Semantics

1738
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,400
The end result of kicked out

1739
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,424
Because he's too

1740
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
Something like that or he left

1741
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:31,776
Strategically in order to create a propaganda

1742
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
Write the end result

1743
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,128
You did create a propaganda machine in service of trump

1744
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,688
Deathstroke so whatever the actual reason

1745
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,992
For it is irrelevant

1746
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:46,368
Succeed in doing that Obama wasn't a

1747
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
Like

1748
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
About Obama

1749
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,488
Batman was

1750
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
Ifucking thinker

1751
01:25:54,304 --> 01:26:00,448
I know but at the same time there's a lot of people coming out to show who like say stuff like that

1752
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,552
Brave

1753
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,024
President

1754
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,304
Diva dresses bear

1755
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,144
Christ

1756
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,936
Blessing the next Pueblo

1757
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:44,480
Crab

1758
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:49,088
Respect

1759
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
But

1760
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,680
You laid out everything he said word for word

1761
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
What he told

1762
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,224
Fisher in the system

1763
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,296
Trump knows that music

1764
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,960
It's just very very

1765
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
Well the truth of the matter is

1766
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,640
There are those who believe in

1767
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:51,040
Truth truth or can I take it as an insult but as a point of Pride and I think your entire audience

1768
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,744
There people that know the truth

1769
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,536
Mainly because

1770
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,072
All we believe in is

1771
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
F****** Maps it out perfect

1772
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,032
You told me what Rodger Stone already told

1773
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:17,408
And you knew that he had already told me

1774
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:23,808
Supposed to not be what it working this out

1775
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
U82 like

1776
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,976
Have you ever seen

1777
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,280
A video of a dog falling off a dock

1778
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
Like

1779
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:45,312
Tara videos you can find a seat at once in awhile in my life where it's a dog who's hanging off a dog

1780
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:51,968
And it's scrambling with its paws trying to stay on the dock with a lower half is falling off

1781
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,528
Trying so hard

1782
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,904
That's what it's like to be to watch Alex Jones be lied to by Steve almost

1783
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
There's this moment there is like

1784
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,280
You're telling me the same things Rodger Stone told me and

1785
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,072
You can do this

1786
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:07,840
Told

1787
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Me

1788
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,216
And like you're not going to get there you're falling off that dog is a cat

1789
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,496
I think it's one of those videos of

1790
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
The cat where it's like

1791
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
I know

1792
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
I can get the top of that

1793
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,480
I'm about to go it's like slippery

1794
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
There similarities

1795
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,320
There similarities

1796
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,392
It's just sad to me it's really sad

1797
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,696
You see the like sort of jump off

1798
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:37,024
Point of like where life could have been entirely

1799
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,816
The world could be dead

1800
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,888
Trump I don't

1801
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
Thank you would have won

1802
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,448
And that's not to say that Alex

1803
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
Is the reason the tripod

1804
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
I know it's enough

1805
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:53,664
Overpopulation

1806
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
If you had just like

1807
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,040
Either been neutral like he was in the Obama McCain election

1808
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,832
He had been against

1809
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:07,232
Trump because hey they tried to run up on me or something like that

1810
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,512
Would it maybe huge difference

1811
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,584
And quite frankly I think Alex Jones is going crazy

1812
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,632
Is entire operation is

1813
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Descended into

1814
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:21,056
Bigot filled Madness sent 2015

1815
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,360
Neville is so much iron

1816
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,640
Is so dangerous

1817
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
They're like

1818
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,248
I think we could have saved everybody a lot of trouble if that dog would have got on that.

1819
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,576
Like if he would have realized

1820
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
Fox TV

1821
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,880
Rodger Stone

1822
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Clearly

1823
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
Why are they pretending not to know each other

1824
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,512
Yet they say

1825
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,048
Word for word

1826
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
Verbatim the same stop

1827
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,144
Is it together

1828
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
Could have saved the world

1829
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,824
Well if we're working under the operating position of

1830
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
Neoliberalism

1831
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,920
Perhaps the root cause of all

1832
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:00,480
Eyeglass

1833
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Oh yeah

1834
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,296
But which is which

1835
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,088
Good neoliberalism is

1836
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:09,184
Bilderberg

1837
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:15,584
So I mean Hillary Hillary is President would have had the same result as Obama's president

1838
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,144
We're just pushing me people into

1839
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:18,912
Two more and more of

1840
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:25,568
Trump is the inevitability

1841
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,104
Of a broken

1842
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,664
Democratize Republican

1843
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
Capitalist

1844
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
What

1845
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,040
Yeah I mean

1846
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,320
Kleptocratic

1847
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,648
Maybe

1848
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:43,488
We're going to look at this from history

1849
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,768
Really have to

1850
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Because if you

1851
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:49,120
Driving to the day-to-day this is all unreal

1852
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
Unreal

1853
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,032
2017

1854
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:00,896
F****** gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum

1855
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,480
Emperor

1856
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,016
Put the thumb up and down on

1857
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:11,136
But like this is f****** insane so look at it

1858
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,928
And you see all of these little

1859
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Pieces coming

1860
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
Together

1861
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,000
Which perhaps made what is

1862
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,048
Really going on and inevitability

1863
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:22,400
And instead of saying Mercer it's all of these things

1864
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,960
You can really point to all of these

1865
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,520
Historical inertia factors

1866
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,336
Better just pushing us ever closer

1867
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,640
To complete

1868
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,992
Can I can I poke holes in your intellectualizing

1869
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,272
Could I please

1870
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
I don't think it matters

1871
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:47,232
It is it is interesting to think twenty years from now that's a

1872
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,256
Fun conversations

1873
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,840
Whatever happened

1874
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,448
Weather weather Trump

1875
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,752
You know like you described

1876
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,776
Kleptocratic

1877
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
Unhinged

1878
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:07,456
Unhinged meaning

1879
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,992
Tether to ideology

1880
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:14,112
It's not be easier if you was just

1881
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:18,464
Because I supposed to like

1882
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,488
I'm going to

1883
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,768
Advantage of

1884
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
Some of these I mean I have

1885
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:27,168
Leanings towards white supremacy, take advantage of that block is best

1886
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
Video

1887
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,264
Heather ideological

1888
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,312
I'd steal everything

1889
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,872
IGN up and really excited

1890
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:36,896
He's dangerous

1891
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,920
Conservative

1892
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
Miller militia types

1893
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,784
Whether that's inevitable

1894
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Don't matter

1895
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,344
Customer service did do this

1896
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
Right

1897
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:49,440
Is the person

1898
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:53,024
I am though

1899
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,072
And the 45 Club isn't play

1900
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:01,728
If Barbara tuchman wasn't like in her seventies goddamnit she would write the greatest

1901
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:10,944
I will donate not have to have a job

1902
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,736
I have a lot of thoughts

1903
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,040
Anyway

1904
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,600
Of Steve pieczenik before we get into something that I think is

1905
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,368
Fun

1906
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,488
Is the last clip of Steve pieczenik

1907
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
Do not

1908
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,560
Get the picture

1909
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,584
But he's being played

1910
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,168
Whoever Trump is he is a force

1911
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,192
Contend with

1912
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
And he will not tolerate

1913
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,896
Testosterone

1914
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,768
They lost all credibility

1915
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,328
Also just fun to remember that on 911

1916
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
Trump's response

1917
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,120
Was now my building

1918
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
What's bigger he said that on

1919
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
News interview.

1920
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,984
Now I have the tallest building in

1921
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
Yeah actually say

1922
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,296
I don't know if it's barely is

1923
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,344
How f****** fun would have been

1924
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,208
Fantasy scenario that Rodger Stone

1925
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:34,656
So Trump

1926
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,776
That would be amazing I would have voted for Trump

1927
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:49,760
Patriots

1928
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,136
And real

1929
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:01,536
Real statement

1930
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,800
Trump believes that are real

1931
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,128
It trumps all these other fake people we've got a bet on it

1932
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
Fremont

1933
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,624
Because it was the truth

1934
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,512
I'm so fortunate as America

1935
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,560
You are to have Trump

1936
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
Spanish time

1937
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
You don't need to do this

1938
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,520
Smart individual

1939
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:46,080
Incredibly true

1940
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,664
He understood what happened in 911 because he knows Silverstein

1941
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,480
He knows the World Trade Center better than anybody

1942
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
Because

1943
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,552
Why would he know the world

1944
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,344
Anyone

1945
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
Other than

1946
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Abject

1947
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:02,976
Almost got it

1948
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:06,560
Dog dog just fell off the dock see this thing is he was

1949
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
Told

1950
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,632
Trump is going to go after 9/11

1951
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:13,728
Trump is going to go after the rape

1952
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
Paint old house Rodger

1953
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,128
The only person I think that's the only person that he had access to it

1954
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:23,456
Yeah you've sold me on the two of them working together

1955
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:29,856
It's at the top of the show

1956
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:36,256
Believe that people are successful I would like an hour and 20 minutes ago I said a lot of

1957
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,536
This is about

1958
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:50,848
Months ago you have to know that I have a plan

1959
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,456
I'm not going to make a Bulbasaur

1960
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,480
Is why we

1961
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,760
We have the open

1962
01:37:58,016 --> 01:38:00,576
Of you know a lot about Alex

1963
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,880
Fair enough

1964
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
So

1965
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,536
In terms of Rodger Stone and Steve pieczenik

1966
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,072
Together pretty early on

1967
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,888
Is there anyway that we can

1968
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
Can prove that

1969
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:18,240
Without hacking your emails no

1970
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,264
That's the thing be

1971
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,032
Because if we

1972
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,872
Actually have concrete proof of that the whole different story

1973
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,200
The problem is it is

1974
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,248
Alex

1975
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,064
Amazing circumstantial proof

1976
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,648
Obviously working together but we can't pull up

1977
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
Look

1978
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:38,976
Re-up

1979
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:43,328
No judge obviously Alex Jones Show is a perfect

1980
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,152
As like a

1981
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:00,736
Judge Judy

1982
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:04,832
No it's B is suing in small claims

1983
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:17,376
Anyway I think we would be the defendant

1984
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:19,168
I think once he realizes that

1985
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:21,216
Conceivably we are the people who are doing

1986
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
The most

1987
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,288
Dangerous work about it

1988
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
His credibility

1989
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:30,176
I do think he might sue us for playing Clips ourselves

1990
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:37,856
Temperature

1991
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,928
I do not recognize the authority of the store

1992
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,024
I am showing up here as a child

1993
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,816
I will be writing my name

1994
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,632
Thank you very much

1995
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:54,496
Anyway

1996
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,360
This is the 2015

1997
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,896
Investigation

1998
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Think this is actually where we'll put it

1999
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:05,248
Yeah I think you're right Steve pieczenik Rodger Stone

2000
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,320
In League with the mysterious 45 Club

2001
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,136
45 group

2002
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,720
You got Sean Connery

2003
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,864
Watermelon

2004
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,912
The guy from

2005
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,960
20000 Leagues Under the Sea

2006
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
Right

2007
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Really who's the Indian dude

2008
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
I don't know

2009
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:34,688
Where's the graphic novel

2010
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:37,760
Alright

2011
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
Anyway

2012
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
We have a little bit of a

2013
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:43,648
A bone cruise from The Mummy

2014
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:50,048
Here at the end we have. We're done with her 2015 investigation aspect of

2015
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
This episode

2016
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
But

2017
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,888
I'm going back through Arie listen to

2018
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:57,216
To the December 29th episode

2019
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,752
I realized that I

2020
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,032
It off too early

2021
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Because

2022
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,872
Alex Jones has his friend Kevin Booth

2023
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,640
Song

2024
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:06,176
Who is the guy who was

2025
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:10,528
Bill Hicks

2026
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,808
Right absolutely

2027
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,392
So the two are on because Kevin Booth

2028
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Have a guess

2029
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,720
A friend

2030
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
Film that he

2031
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,072
He's doing this guy was

2032
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
The gentleman

2033
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,888
By the name of doctor Gala

2034
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,960
He had done a lot of work

2035
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,496
In terms of

2036
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,800
Interviewing people who defected from Ice

2037
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,128

A complete model to deal with terrorism and

Understanding and

2052

Responding to terrorism

2053
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:04,800
Doctor Gala over the years I've interviewed cadres representing a terrorist organization

2054
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,872
The Isis Defector interviews of late are unique

2055
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:12,224
Then the world as he was one of the first researchers who managed to reach Isis defectors

2056
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,528
And persuade them to talk about their stories open

2057
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,600
Editorially and parentheses I'm going to add this

2058
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:19,136

2059
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,720

01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
For the most part

2075
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
Because of

2076
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,560
The incredibly dangerous work

2077
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:00,096
Because

2078
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,680
Cultural revolution

2079
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
He's.

2080
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
Longview lawn

2081
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
Because he has talked

2082
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
People who

2083
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,688
Confirm Isis right here knows who those people are

2084
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,712
Information from them

2085
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,248
But they do not want to be out

2086
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,064
Kevin Booth

2087
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,624
It was on with Alex that I didn't

2088
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
To this interview

2089
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,672
Is because I have like

2090
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,464
They have terrible Tech difficulties

2091
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,792
Kevin Federline

2092
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,216
I made a big mistake

2093
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,800
You're not covering this interview and I'm going to rectify that now

2094
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,592
This interview is damaged

2095
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
In many ways

2096
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,152
And I'm

2097
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
Started

2098
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
With Alex Jones

2099
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
Introducing

2100
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,016
The gas doctor

2101
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
He allows the guest

2102
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,368
Weights

2103
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,672
Dr. Gala goes on Alex Jones

2104
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,256
Because of his relationship with Kevin Boothe

2105
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,840
Documentary

2106
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
The turkey

2107
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:12,544
It seems so far away is somebody who knows what the f*** is

2108
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:19,200
Let's see what happens when an actual Scholars shows up accidentally on Infowars

2109
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,224
Accidental

2110
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,784
Situation

2111
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,552
I don't think so

2112
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
But also

2113
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:26,624
Here's how Alex Jones sets it up

2114
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,416
It's important to take note of it

2115
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
Because I think he would redo this

2116
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Afterwards

2117
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:32,768
Pizza Hut

2118
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,608
Dangerous areas Doug's Cadillac

2119
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,032
HBO show me other channel

2120
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,080
War won the belt

2121
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,088
Fredericksburg

2122
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,032
An exposed at the west of the Turkish government now there's our funding up

2123
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
So

2124
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
Alex Jones as suggest

2125
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
And presented this

2126
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
He knows

2127
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
Who this guy is

2128
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,112
Exposing that

2129
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
The US

2130
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,184
People that

2131
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
As opposed to

2132
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:38,816
I don't believe that he's getting people

2133
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,168
I don't know I can

2134
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:47,008
Speak to that but I don't know if that's the case

2135
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
What causes

2136
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,312
They play the super

2137
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:54,688
That's really interesting ideas about like what are the biggest

2138
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,224
Identifiers

2139
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,016
For what puts someone at risk

2140
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:03,648
Of being a member who has been killed

2141
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:07,232
Us drone strike

2142
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Poverty

2143
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,072
Basically a lot of

2144
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:17,728
Motivation

2145
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:23,616
The way we reacted after World War 1 caused World War

2146
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,920
The way we are reacting after 9/11

2147
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,736
Desert Storm

2148
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,040
Further

2149
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:33,088
Hoover Dam

2150
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,624
Are chicken eggs

2151
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,976
Tricom anyways

2152
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,560
What is presenting it as this guy is a

2153
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
Exposing

2154
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,376
Is funding Isis

2155
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,240
He does not know that that is not what it's going to be exposed in the

2156
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,776
I have two clips

2157
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,056
They're a little long

2158
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,336
But they're necessary

2159
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
The first one I lived

2160
01:46:59,456 --> 01:46:59,968
Just labeled

2161
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,784
Is not a name for warrior

2162
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,584
The facts

2163
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
Syria

2164
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,568
What's a geopolitical

2165
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,104
Behind Isis shirt

2166
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,976
I have a question

2167
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:46,560
Most of the time

2168
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,688
Saudi Arabia

2169
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,960
14 factors

2170
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,752
DTC

2171
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,696
Great

2172
01:48:54,912 --> 01:49:00,032
Connection

2173
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,728
Angel

2174
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,776

2175
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
Calendar

2176
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,528
And right now

2177
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,464
Make it the critical

2178
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
Decision

2179
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,024
On the battlefield

2180
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:01,472
Russia

2181
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
So

2182
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,136
He's he's

2183
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,208
Cuz it's kind of a little bit thick

2184
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,488
Red

2185
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,072
There are 40 to 45 year old

2186
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:32,704
Retired military personnel director

2187
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:40,128
Well some parts group message Battlefield they are making

2188
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:44,224
Battlefield decision Hughes sayings

2189
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
From

2190
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,600
Whether or not you want

2191
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
To deem him

2192
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,904
Incredible or not

2193
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,184
Decision that you have to make

2194
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:55,744
Information

2195
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,792
Is giving her

2196
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,632
He is

2197
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,448
I've looked into it a little bit

2198
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:09,824
Credible track record history of interviewing

2199
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,640
10000

2200
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,040
Plus I ran

2201
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
31

2202
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:20,832
Russia

2203
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:21,856
And it is

2204
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:24,928
Turkey and Saudi Arabia Qatar in Turkey

2205
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:27,744
Those those those

2206
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,536
Consistently given by ISIS

2207
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,560
60 factors

2208
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:31,840
So you can

2209
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,120
You can either

2210
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:35,424
Except that as

2211
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,216
Each one of them

2212
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
Is getting different information

2213
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,360
As opposed to a unified

2214
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:50,272
Bright

2215
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,392
Would love me to make us analogy but

2216
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:59,744
Isis isn't a group where they have like

2217
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,584
The heads of all the local meat together

2218
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:09,984
Very likely a piece

2219
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,288
All that that is

2220
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,336
Very likely there is a piece that

2221
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,360
Swayed by a Ron

2222
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:20,736
Interesting

2223
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,552
Yeah

2224
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,880
Talking about

2225
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,696
If that is

2226
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,720
If that is

2227
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:31,488
Possible

2228
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,536
It is possible

2229
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,560
That all

2230
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,936
It's entirely possible that what

2231
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,960
Really going on with

2232
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,728
Isis

2233
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,264
Is that it is a loosely

2234
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,592
Connect

2235
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,640
Responsibility for so many different

2236
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,664
Terrorist attack

2237
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:56,064
Because they are direct

2238
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,880
End up fighting with each other

2239
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:02,464
BMW

2240
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:09,120
It was pretty like you remember when it was like one big group

2241
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:15,776
Ymn the Luchador World Order

2242
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,080
I got you

2243
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,872
Like maybe there was a central

2244
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:23,200
Idea to Isis at one point and then became fractured

2245
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:27,040
There's a whole lot of possibilities and I don't know

2246
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,064
Different groups of

2247
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,832
People

2248
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:32,416
Looking for funding and different people

2249
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:36,512
Responsible

2250
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
With money

2251
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:41,632
And they don't necessarily

2252
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,424
They don't have a centralized

2253
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,216
Tax plan or whatever it is

2254
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:48,800
Do you want to go to

2255
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,104
To find a way to get that

2256
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:55,712
If they're gold temporarily aligned with Russia they get Russian

2257
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:04,416
Mercenaries less than

2258
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:08,768
To get a caliphate

2259
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:15,168
Will kill time to people for you if you want it

2260
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,752
Through in my mind

2261
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:22,080
And I'm excluded from my mom

2262
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:23,104
What is misrepresenting

2263
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,664
Agreed

2264
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,968
So that he is telling the truth

2265
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,696
You to remember that I think might have slipped your mind

2266
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:41,792
Just want this first one probably not and that is that Alex set it up

2267
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,584
America

2268
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:51,008
The second you almost certainly a forgotten

2269
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:55,360
If we covered this on the last 20

2270
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,128
15 episode

2271
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,920
It begins with Alex Jones

2272
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,456
Pretending the Infowars being

2273
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:02,784
Being hacked by the

2274
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,344
He believes that it is by the Turkish

2275
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:10,720
And what have you I need you to keep that in your mind for what is going to

2276
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,000
To happen to clips from now

2277
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,048
In your mind

2278
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,328
Cuz I have

2279
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:19,168
Very strong theory about what is actually happening

2280
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,704
I think you might have actually been hacked

2281
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,776
Yeah

2282
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,568
I think you might actually

2283
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:31,712
Oh my God is looking for

2284
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:35,040
No

2285
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,088
Aspect is wrong

2286
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,168
Identity very specifically said he asked

2287
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,472
These people if they were chechens of nevermind.

2288
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,920
Eyeballs work

2289
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
Countering Isaac

2290
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:16,000
I don't say

2291
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,696
Well now let's

2292
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,744
You listed a total of like

2293
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,096
Russia

2294
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:56,192
The only one that has not he doesn't even really necessarily

2295
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,800
Syria right

2296
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:04,128
Guitar Arabia obviously

2297
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:10,016
Vandoren probably is not worth fighting about

2298
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,624
And I like interview

2299
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,416
Time

2300
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,696
In his busy schedule

2301
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:21,536
To argue that there's no way Russia

2302
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
There's no way

2303
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:25,376
Because that's his that's already his argument is that

2304
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,656
Syria is

2305
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,288
Dr. Gala

2306
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,152
Pretty much lays out a very concrete case

2307
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,176
Haha

2308
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Assad

2309
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,760
Working together based on his

2310
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,296
And you know what's awesome

2311
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
About

2312
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,344
Somebody who knows what they're f******

2313
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,368
Talking about

2314
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,392
When asked

2315
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,416
The direct question

2316
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,768
My proof is the people that I've talked to

2317
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,048
He does not say

2318
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,864
I know this is true

2319
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,680
Right he is still

2320
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:03,264
You stopping to the idea like I'm just reporting what I saw

2321
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,104
It's entirely possible

2322
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:24,000
Aggies flummoxed

2323
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:29,376
Is there the entire time and he knows to shut the fuk up

2324
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:32,704
Chaotic elements into Alex's life

2325
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,752
Kevin

2326
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,336
Imagine

2327
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:47,808
That last clip was over Skype

2328
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,088
I've been Skype

2329
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:49,856
Attacked

2330
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,648
Until they have to do this next

2331
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,928
When they come back from

2332
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,696
Commercial

2333
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,976
Their Skype isn't working

2334
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,000
And they have to use

2335
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,096
And so it sounds a little different but also its

2336
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,888
How is he

2337
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,448
He's in the United States

2338
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:11,104
I'm not competent of anything at this point

2339
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
WeedMaps

2340
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:21,088
I am still

2341
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:23,136
Energy drink

2342
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:26,208
Monster Energy drink it is on Dance Floor

2343
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:26,976
And leg

2344
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:34,656
In the United States in so much as I don't really care to wrestle with it

2345
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,448
I want to argue

2346
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,080
If if we're talking about this

2347
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,664
If you were saying that the Skype one

2348
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,968
Because

2349
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,760
He's in some sort of

2350
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:52,064
Remote area where in

2351
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,600
The signal just may have dropped

2352
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:59,744
It's possible I don't have I don't have a concrete answer on this

2353
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,304
Basically dropped but I I want

2354
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,376
Bring that up most can really variable

2355
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,912
That's alright

2356
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,704
In this next

2357
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,752
Dr. Gala

2358
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:13,824
Second ago

2359
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:16,896
Lays out a really convincing

2360
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:18,176
For why

2361
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,456
Asada

2362
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:20,480
Isis are working

2363
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:21,248
Together

2364
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:23,808
Very negative reaction

2365
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:27,648
Yalla

2366
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:33,280
ICS Orgrimmar on the side bivol.

2367
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:37,888
Yeah you know me

2368
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,640
You will have anyone

2369
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:50,688
Usher runs me

2370
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,368
AAA

2371
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:02,464
Just basically theorizing with a person is clear

2372
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,000
Yeah

2373
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,584
100 time

2374
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:19,872
My friend over there is that is chaos that is very complicated in that

2375
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:25,504
You have a lot of people with a lot of agenda trying to get money trying to dominate trying to create their own things and it's

2376
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,064
It's a very chaotic situation

2377
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,904
What

2378
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:38,048
I'm not fighting each other

2379
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:40,864
Calendar

2380
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,400
To get to the

2381
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:48,032
Just real quick what are you saying is that

2382
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,128
But he runs into

2383
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,152
Interrogate

2384
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,432
Interviewing

2385
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
Is Isis defectors

2386
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:56,992
Is why

2387
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:58,528
Are we

2388
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,296
Just never fighting

2389
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,064
Mossad

2390
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
Which is an interesting question

2391
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,672
Is that the rebels are not

2392
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
Isis

2393
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,488
And so if

2394
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,792
If Isis is in Syria

2395
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:13,376
American and Russian governments both

2396
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:15,424
Can say that they are fighting

2397
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,192
Against

2398
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,496
When in reality what they're doing is fighting a

2399
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,264
Rebels

2400
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,288
Who are fighting against

2401
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:23,360
Listen there's a very pro-assad

2402
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:24,896
Position about the United

2403
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,920
States and Russia.

2404
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:28,224
In order to maintain some sort of

2405
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:32,320
Stability there where is it

2406
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,344
Then

2407
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,880
Siri is up

2408
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:38,720
For grabs at that point and we all know that side in Russian

2409
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:43,584
Absolutely but very concrete

2410
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,608
Example

2411
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:47,424
But Alex that makes him

2412
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,192
Freak out

2413
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,472
Right

2414
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,520
Indiana history

2415
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
Misha

2416
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,224
David

2417
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:02,272
Angela Fraser broken

2418
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:09,184
80s playlist

2419
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:14,304
Taylor Schilling

2420
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,072
And then

2421
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,240
That's a question

2422
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,384
Eurasian

2423
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,528
Indian history

2424
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,768
Lincoln truck

2425
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,352
Close of Bayshore regime

2426
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,144
Thursday

2427
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:54,240
Play Sunday Charlotte sold weapons and ammunition

2428
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,896
Question

2429
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,392
It's clearly

2430
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,952
Understandable

2431
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,120
Michael Flynn

2432
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,168
A few months ago

2433
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:27,520
The US government

2434
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,824
Basically funded Health Isis

2435
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,872
That was a direct order of Obama

2436
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:36,224
I don't think so or I have never heard of

2437
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,272
I want that

2438
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:43,392
Man Alex wanted a different outcome position or two

2439
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:48,000
So so very thing that he presented at the top of the interview

2440
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:50,304
The closing do you know ask somebody

2441
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,840
Never heard that

2442
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:52,608
Crazy

2443
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,704
So the doctors

2444
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,728
Point is that

2445
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,496
When Isis

2446
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:01,568
Took Libyan oil refinery

2447
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,128
Bisharp

2448
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:04,896
Sent

2449
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,944
Syrian Engineers to

2450
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,272
Build-A-Bear to rebuild does it refinery

2451
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,808
The moment that happened

2452
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:14,624
They started selling oil

2453
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,184
Bashar the people who defected we're like

2454
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,720
What the f***

2455
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:23,072
That's probably a big reason why they detected

2456
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:26,400
Killing the people that made me want to join Isis

2457
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,680
Because they were

2458
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,448
Right

2459
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,776
And that's something that he's gotten first-hand

2460
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,896
Provable

2461
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,920
And it's something that's obvious

2462
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:39,712
Okay

2463
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:42,784
That's not a good sign for Alex Alex

2464
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,624
Alright let's f****** just asked

2465
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,648
The question

2466
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,696
Mike Flynn

2467
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,000
Didn't quit he got fired

2468
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,328
He presented equip

2469
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,144
And he's come out and said that you asked

2470
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,424
Creative and fun

2471
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:03,008
Right

2472
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,056
I don't know I don't know that to be true

2473
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:09,408
Save-A-Lot

2474
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,456
Anger that's f******

2475
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:15,552
Commercial immediately

2476
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,600
Course

2477
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,392
Here is

2478
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:20,416
Is take on

2479
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,696
The interview that he

2480
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
Bridget a doctor

2481
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,048
I'm at s

2482
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:33,984
Film

2483
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,128
No one else to say

2484
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
Reportedly

2485
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,776
Set the West did that using Al-Qaeda

2486
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:10,336
It's on record

2487
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,872
What would you like to remind people

2488
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,992
Al-Qaeda is fighting Isis

2489
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:19,552
In most parts of the world

2490
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,088
For obvious

2491
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:26,464
Obvious reasons are to some people might not

2492
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,768
Understand that

2493
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,840
Specifically born out of Afghanistan

2494
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:35,424
He specifically born out of Iraq

2495
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:38,240
Is this situation that Isis

2496
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,264
Is capitalized

2497
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,056
To facilitate

2498
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:44,640
Really want which is the end

2499
02:07:45,152 --> 02:07:47,456
The ultimate battle between the West

2500
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,480
And the Middle East

2501
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,296
Switch Bannon and clearly Alex Jones

2502
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:54,368
Their ass

2503
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,648
More of a

2504
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,928
Freedom fighting or go

2505
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,952
Innovation like that's

2506
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:01,792
Really there gold brother got off track a little bit

2507
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,376
But the point being is Al-Qaeda is

2508
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,936
Far and Away

2509
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,240
Interested in avoiding back kind

2510
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:14,336
And a caliphate

2511
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,104
Into something

2512
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:15,872
Don't want

2513
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,408
Involved in Afghan

2514
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:20,480
Of all the things that I've going to stand

2515
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:23,552
It is a country that truly believes

2516
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:25,600
Being its own country

2517
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:30,464
It does not want to be part of Saudi Arabia it does not want to be part of all of these

2518
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,488
He's different places

2519
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,280
It doesn't to be absorbed

2520
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:36,352
But all of the wars that have been fought in Afghanistan

2521
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:39,168
Heavenly f

2522
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:41,984
Soic

2523
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,568
Is another one of those

2524
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,848
Take over Afghanistan

2525
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,640
Al-Qaeda

2526
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:55,296
Ideologically opposed to a dum dum it appears that there

2527
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:58,624
Islam is all radical Islam as

2528
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,392
As opposed to

2529
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,440
Any number of sunni-shiite

2530
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:08,096
Divisions between the between

2531
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:17,824
I got a better fighter spider-verse I do better version of to school you all day

2532
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:24,224
Identity evropa

2533
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,208
You would like to tell you that all day but at the same time

2534
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:35,744
Paint with one brush

2535
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,608
All of Islam radical Islam

2536
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:43,680
His argument is just that the globalist

2537
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:45,984
Decided to change the name from Al-Qaeda to Isis

2538
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,008
Confuse people

2539
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,288
That's

2540
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:52,128
Is indicate a lack of reading indicates a lack of global awareness

2541
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:53,152
Anyway

2542
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:56,736
Did you see that you see in that last course

2543
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,016
Sects of Islam in

2544
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
In the same way that Prada

2545
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:01,088
Isn't products

2546
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:02,880
F****** Lutheran

2547
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Goddamn

2548
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:07,744
Quakers

2549
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:15,424
Like it's all of those things everything was not Catholic

2550
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:18,240
Has Dark Pulse

2551
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:22,080
If you ever watch the order Temple

2552
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:25,408
Is influx in concert

2553
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:27,456
Play as well difference

2554
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:34,112
Different f****** Lutheran's that are much closer to Catholics than 10.

2555
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:38,720
Catholicism

2556
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:41,792
U-Haul POS

2557
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,560
Acceptance

2558
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:43,584
Alex

2559
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,144
As part of a wide swath of

2560
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,936
Christian identities

2561
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:53,312
Anyway for the idea that any Muslim is different

2562
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:59,968
Laura Lou Marano couple weeks ago in 27 there is no moderate Islam

2563
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,760
Piratical

2564
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,808
F****** that sort of language

2565
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:07,904
It's not going to ruin the world do what it going to do

2566
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:08,928
Convince

2567
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,976
Some people on The Fringe

2568
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,280
Who are close to radical Islam

2569
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:19,680
To go all the way

2570
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,984
Not necessarily A

2571
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:29,152
No it's not but what other purpose does it serve other than to make white people afraid

2572
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:31,968
Those two purposes are the only real outcomes out of it

2573
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:38,368
Get the specifics that you mean

2574
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,392
Is no positive

2575
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,416
Productive outcome

2576
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:43,232
Comes out of

2577
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,048
The single best

2578
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,584
Parallel I have

2579
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,352
For why

2580
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:50,144
Christianity

2581
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,936
Islam are both stupid

2582
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,776
Their religion

2583
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,848
Look at the way

2584
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,872
They spread

2585
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
And they

2586
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:01,920
Destroy things

2587
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:04,736
Whenever something like for instance

2588
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,016
So many difference

2589
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,064
Muslim sects in Indonesia

2590
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,112
Far-forward

2591
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:11,392
Very moderate

2592
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:14,976
Very interested really in kind of

2593
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,768
That kind of an Evangelical

2594
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:19,584
Also tempered with Buddhist influences

2595
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,608
In the past

2596
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:23,424
Saudi Arabian

2597
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,448
Islamic

2598
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Have been

2599
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:27,264
Different

2600
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,056
People in Indonesia

2601
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:30,080
2

2602
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:31,360
Turn them

2603
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:33,664
Muslims and Christians

2604
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:38,784
Murdered

2605
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,624
Because he's religion

2606
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,160
F****** horrific

2607
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:48,256
Is in Islam is horrific

2608
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,792
In the same way that everybody who believes

2609
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:51,328
In Christianity is

2610
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:52,608
Is it not horrific

2611
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,888
What is 8

2612
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:54,912
It is a

2613
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:56,960
An ideology

2614
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,824
Fundamental fundamental adherence to a structure

2615
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:07,712
Capitalism

2616
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:11,296
Appearances are outdated modes of being

2617
02:13:13,344 --> 02:13:14,624
Ever breed

2618
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:19,744
Yeah I'll be altimate end of all of these religions

2619
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,280
With

2620
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:26,656
If your religion

2621
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:29,728
There's always going to be a certain group of people who sang

2622
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,520
Well it's my job

2623
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,288
To bring it about

2624
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
Because

2625
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,336
It's a prophecy

2626
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:40,736
Has been struggling with

2627
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:43,040
It said I have

2628
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,576
Do it because God tells

2629
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:46,880
Right

2630
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:51,232
F****** Fool by idiots like Alex will War like looking

2631
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:55,840
You'll have

2632
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:57,376
Hey weather

2633
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:59,168
In a revolution Revelation is

2634
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:01,728
Is coming through or it denotes just coincidence

2635
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,568
This is biblical Antichrist

2636
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:08,384
Trump is the Antichrist than George W bush

2637
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,664
Like it's always

2638
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,712
This guy is the epochal

2639
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:16,576
Rhetoric is unnecessary to deal with the actual problems

2640
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:19,648
Now it's the same time everyone accuses everyone of calling people Nazis

2641
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,184
Sometimes they are

2642
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,208
Yeah I do

2643
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,000
The converse of that

2644
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,280
No

2645
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,816
People some people are not

2646
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:28,864
And it turned out a lot of people are not

2647
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,168
December 29th

2648
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:33,984
It's more about Alex

2649
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,664
Who confirms all his Michael Flynn

2650
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:50,880
I will explain

2651
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,672
Why I kind of think

2652
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,440
He might have

2653
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,720
Actually been getting hacked

2654
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:56,000
Pink eye

2655
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:01,632
Different

2656
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:04,960
Successful successful

2657
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
Infowars right now

2658
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,080
With them posting

2659
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:29,024
Good morning

2660
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:34,912
Obama's personal

2661
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:42,080
I don't want that.

2662
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,104
At the traffic

2663
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:49,504
We got our own traffic criminal

2664
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
You're not involved

2665
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:01,792
Because

2666
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:03,584
This is what's going on real world

2667
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,912
Earlier

2668
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,600
He didn't say that either

2669
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,368
Interview

2670
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,160
So here's my thing

2671
02:16:28,928 --> 02:16:29,440
Okay

2672
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,768
The Syrian electronic Army

2673
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:35,072
Alex is asserting

2674
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,096
Sia

2675
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:44,032
Fire meet gasoline lyrics

2676
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:48,896
Hair goes directly over there. Electronic Army

2677
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:50,944
Is Russia rich

2678
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,504
I don't think I don't think necessarily it is

2679
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,344
But if it is

2680
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,368
Situation

2681
02:16:58,624 --> 02:16:59,136
But if it is

2682
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:01,952
Let's possibility

2683
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,744
If that is the case

2684
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,280
I would posit

2685
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,560
That Russia is

2686
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:08,096
Is hacking Alex Jones Show

2687
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:09,376
Because they're not idiots

2688
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:11,680
And they know what this doctor knows

2689
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:20,640
Now here's where it gets fanciful I don't really believe this okay because

2690
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:24,736
I recall now that my

2691
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:25,504
Maybe our

2692
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:30,880
That he should not have.

2693
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:33,184
Yes

2694
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:38,816
The Hat covering her ass cuz I got the bed information put up a bath

2695
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:41,120
And working collect credibility

2696
02:17:41,376 --> 02:17:45,216
To the idea that they have a Turkish person on to talk about Isis

2697
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:46,240
Or they got

2698
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:47,264
Some good

2699
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:54,944
You think I'd want actually was at Air Force Base about how there was a

2700
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,224
Plant

2701
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,760
And everyone was hiding

2702
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:02,112
Right right Frodo

2703
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:03,136
Yeah

2704
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:05,696
That's the other possibility is there

2705
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:11,328
He figured out somebody gave him the plan

2706
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,608
Any of these things are

2707
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,680
Look like

2708
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:18,240
Of course I think that they're fake

2709
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:20,800
But

2710
02:18:21,568 --> 02:18:22,080
If it is real

2711
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:24,128
Don't think it's turkey

2712
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:27,456
I don't think it's some group trying to

2713
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,224
Pretend

2714
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,016
To be somebody I think it's

2715
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:31,040
I think of course it's

2716
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:35,648
There there it there at this point hacking everybody

2717
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,952
This Is Our Land of 2015

2718
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:38,976
True

2719
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:39,744
Therein

2720
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,768
A hack fever

2721
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:44,608
Crazy with their parents

2722
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:49,472
Throw it on the list like I got ahold they got ahold checklist

2723
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:54,336
Their campaigns are going Buckwild to a certain extent

2724
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:56,384
The idea that they would

2725
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:57,920
Feel like

2726
02:18:58,688 --> 02:19:00,224
He's going to interview this guy who

2727
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,248
Knows that

2728
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:04,832
Some of our retired generals are running Isis cells

2729
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:08,672
Why wouldn't they be trying to f*** with that

2730
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:13,280
That's not proof of any

2731
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:18,400
But if their idea is to shut down the sky

2732
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:21,984
Like what you would want to do is

2733
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:24,544
Attempts to shut down the site we run success

2734
02:19:25,824 --> 02:19:31,968
Infowars got to go to security apparently

2735
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,992
It's all fake I was

2736
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,576
Oh well

2737
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:37,344
Anyway

2738
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:40,928
Alex Jones accidentally

2739
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,328
I just love I think that Alex Jones Greatest quote of all time

2740
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:51,680
Dispenser

2741
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,448
Volume

2742
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:54,496
So much it's so clear

2743
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:56,032
So full of s***

2744
02:19:57,824 --> 02:20:00,128
But the only thing about that is that sad

2745
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,408
Suggest to me

2746
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:03,712
That Alex does believe his b*******

2747
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,480
At least in this

2748
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:06,528
Stop to me

2749
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:08,576
So you think he is

2750
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,112
He's angry because

2751
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:16,768
Tubi

2752
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:18,816
I'm not

2753
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
Good enough

2754
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,352
Set this

2755
02:20:20,864 --> 02:20:22,144
To figure out how we

2756
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:22,912
Spin-out

2757
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:26,752
Like velcro that is frustrating as a propaganda

2758
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,616
I've hit a brick wall

2759
02:20:32,896 --> 02:20:33,664
2 minutes away from

2760
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:40,576
I see I thought this question was going to lead to

2761
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:44,672
Him saying well I talked to said that the United States

2762
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:50,048
Now what would I hear in that

2763
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:50,816
Is

2764
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:53,888
I am not getting what I believe to be true

2765
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:54,912
Tubi

2766
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:55,680
Confirmed

2767
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:58,240
By this guy who I have already in

2768
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,008
Interested

2769
02:20:59,264 --> 02:20:59,776
Is annex

2770
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,824
Is super credible

2771
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:05,920
Either I have the choice of

2772
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,712
Entering

2773
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:08,736
That's

2774
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:12,064
I have the choice of being Alex Jones

2775
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,112
And being a whiny little b**** about it

2776
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,392
And kicking you off my show

2777
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:18,464
Belief

2778
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:21,280
Tell you one of those piece of information that

2779
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:24,096
On the 29th

2780
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:28,448
This interview that went really terrible happened before the interview with

2781
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,472
Check

2782
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,800
So

2783
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,080
If he was going

2784
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:35,104
The question thing

2785
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:36,896
And be like

2786
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:38,944
Russia is

2787
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,224
You're saying

2788
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,272
There are some Russian

2789
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,552
Enforces better

2790
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,576
Behind Isis

2791
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,880
I better rethink everything

2792
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:49,184
Then he's got a dovetail that in TuneIn

2793
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:49,952
Interview with Steve

2794
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,000
Right after that

2795
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,816
I would posit that those moment

2796
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:56,352
That's where he almost realizes

2797
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,376
He's getting played

2798
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,168
Are the aftermath

2799
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,448
Of this interview

2800
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:04,288
With Dr yayla not going well at all

2801
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,104
Possibly of like

2802
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:09,408
Is wrong

2803
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:11,456
Belief

2804
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:13,760
His belief has been shaken

2805
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:15,040
Not his propaganda

2806
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,440
All right there

2807
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,208
All right there

2808
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:26,048
No.

2809
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:27,840
It's just such complicated bulshit

2810
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,120
It's very difficult

2811
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:31,168
Unpack exactly what

2812
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,192
Is being Express

2813
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:32,960
Austin what

2814
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:33,728
I what

2815
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,032
Bratz

2816
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,312
Isaac

2817
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:39,616
It's possible

2818
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,896
This belief is being Shake

2819
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:41,664
In a little bit

2820
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,456
I'm Steve trying to come and gone a little

2821
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:44,224
B of A booster shot

2822
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:48,064
In some way that I'm getting out of this

2823
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:48,832
Possible

2824
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:49,856
Possible

2825
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,392
I don't know

2826
02:22:52,416 --> 02:22:53,184
Bottom line is

2827
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:53,952
Is that

2828
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:56,000
I believe the December 2015

2829
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,280
Was a month

2830
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:58,304
Destroyed archon

2831
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:02,144
But there was a chance

2832
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,680
For Alex Jones to be

2833
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,960
Becoming antihero

2834
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,776
Are you f****** Blewett

2835
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:11,360
You f****** blew it real hard

2836
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:16,224
It was possible

2837
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:18,016
I think even a

2838
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,552
Even

2839
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:20,832
Very dumb

2840
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:23,904
Man who believes that the Civil War was about tariffs

2841
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,208
Going going through our investigation

2842
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,280
Has made me believe that he never had a chance

2843
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:36,192
Maybe maybe that would be at every point

2844
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:36,960
One of the top

2845
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:37,728
3

2846
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:40,032
Maybe we'd be in a different situation

2847
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:42,848
Grandpa was

2848
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,664
Who else was he going to go to

2849
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,224
I'm crossing my arms right now very aggressive

2850
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:53,088
For a couple of

2851
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,112
5

2852
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:58,464
The reasons that I'm doing that are like

2853
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,256
There have been election

2854
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:01,792
I swear he's just stayed out of

2855
02:24:02,304 --> 02:24:03,840
Even if he's not picture

2856
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,376
Because you can't

2857
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:07,424
Falls out

2858
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,728
It doesn't necessarily mean that he would just

2859
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:11,776
Have to choose somebody in the Lacs

2860
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:12,544
He's done that

2861
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,312
The past

2862
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:16,384
Piecewise together chance

2863
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:18,944
You haven't experienced what I've experienced

2864
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:21,760
Nion

2865
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:23,808
Hundreds of hours of Alex Jones

2866
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:25,600
How are you trying to say

2867
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:32,000
Asperger's and b*******

2868
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,584
But the reason that I bring that up is that like

2869
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:37,120
In my investigation

2870
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,656
Can I listen to a bunch of

2871
02:24:38,912 --> 02:24:39,424
Old stuff

2872
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,448
Stuff to

2873
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:41,728
In addition to the 20

2874
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:43,776
15 stuff cuz every now and again

2875
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:46,336
I'm trying to find like stuff from 2008

2876
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:47,616
2009

2877
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:48,640
That

2878
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:50,432
And I would be a good episode

2879
02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,456
Right

2880
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:54,272
And you see a different man then

2881
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,808
You see if

2882
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,088
Not

2883
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:05,024
There's no doubt about that

2884
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,072
Will you see a completely different person

2885
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:10,912
Like there's an episode in 2008 I was listening to the other day where

2886
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:12,960
He sings along to the Renegades of

2887
02:25:13,216 --> 02:25:13,728
The funk

2888
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:15,520
As they come in from commercial

2889
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:21,920
Actually enjoying himself and having a great time on that episode it's right when Jesse

2890
02:25:22,176 --> 02:25:25,504
Ventura gets his Conspiracy Theory show pilot

2891
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,064
It's a Jesse Ventura as a guest on the show

2892
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
And Alex is like

2893
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,368
He's so

2894
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:36,768
Excited and bubbly about the idea that friend is going to get a Conspiracy Theory TV show

2895
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:43,424
Look I want to be weird but you should have me as a sidekick there's a bubbly like

2896
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:45,984
Laughing like not fake laughing

2897
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:50,080
Real there's a sincere enjoyment of being VSCO

2898
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:52,896
And I don't feel that anymore

2899
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:55,456
I don't feel that in 2015 I don't feel bad

2900
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:56,224
June 27th

2901
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,760
I feel like he's a

2902
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:58,528
Broken

2903
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:00,320
A disaster of a person

2904
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,880
And I do think there is a chance for Redemption

2905
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,416
In terms of

2906
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,696
We see it

2907
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:09,024
Very clearly in the stuff that we've got over on this episode

2908
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:12,096
Bubbling point of all the stuff that we've seen

2909
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:12,864
In the last

2910
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:15,680
F*** 20 episodes of the investigation

2911
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:18,496
There are there are forces that are trying to manipulate

2912
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:23,616
Their forces there and I don't want to take his responsibilities out of it

2913
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:24,640
But

2914
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,920
He had a chance

2915
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:28,224
2 speed that Steve pieczenik

2916
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:29,760
And Rodger Stone

2917
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:30,784
And who knows who else

2918
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:31,552
Behind the scenes

2919
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,856
We're lying to him in a concerted effort

2920
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:36,160
To be their propaganda mouthpiece

2921
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,184
Yeah

2922
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:38,976
And if you turn Face on them

2923
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:43,840
If you can hit the bad guy with a chair right there right there is that

2924
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:45,632
Possibility

2925
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,912
Botanica Goldstar

2926
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:55,616
Maybe I watch too much wrestling watch too much wrestling and there is that idea that there is the Ville

2927
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:57,920
Dylan's Redemption

2928
02:26:58,176 --> 02:26:59,968
Like all of these things are possible

2929
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:03,040
From everything I can see

2930
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,832
He had a chance

2931
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:06,624
It was in December

2932
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,160
Eddie f****** blue it

2933
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:13,536
Okay with that argument and that's from a personal

2934
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:17,632
That

2935
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,168
My parents

2936
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:21,728
I agree to see through

2937
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,520
Fat Republican bulshit

2938
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,312
They had a chance

2939
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:27,104
Corso now

2940
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,640
Corseted

2941
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:30,176
I just don't think

2942
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:36,576
Every person every person that has different like when it is in your personal

2943
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:39,392
If your journey in your life

2944
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:42,464
I think everybody has a moment where they can go

2945
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:48,864
Superbad or super good parents probably only affect you

2946
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,888
Like

2947
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:53,216
I mean and some other people around them in their personal life and the rest of my

2948
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,312
Sure that small-scale

2949
02:27:57,568 --> 02:27:59,360
See the propaganda put millions of listeners

2950
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:01,408
He had he had the

2951
02:28:01,664 --> 02:28:03,712
If the difference between with your parents at

2952
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,736
The Twig breaking

2953
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:06,528
Scheme of things

2954
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,552
With Alex

2955
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:10,112
A glacier falling apart

2956
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:11,904
I just don't think we ever had a

2957
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:17,280
The moment the nominee was Hillary they never had a chance

2958
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:22,144
Like Hillary but even if it was Bernie

2959
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:25,216
If you eat

2960
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:25,984
For him

2961
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,520
He could stay out of an election

2962
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:28,800
In between Bernie

2963
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:34,944
Absolutely entire worldview is based on socialism leading to totalitarianism

2964
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,480
To fight Bernie

2965
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:39,040
He was a white

2966
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:41,344
Bradley's Bernie was a

2967
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:44,416
Have gone through

2968
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:47,744
But almost certainly

2969
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,768
100%

2970
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:50,816
But yeah but

2971
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:57,728
I think they never die think the Republicans never had a

2972
02:28:58,752 --> 02:28:59,520
Because of Hillary

2973
02:28:59,776 --> 02:29:02,848
Like they were they were primed for the con man

2974
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:05,920
Because they were so blinded by their hate for Hillary

2975
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,480
I think there are a lot of

2976
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,504
People who are like that

2977
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,272
Alex Jones

2978
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:16,416
I hesitate to say exactly a large

2979
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,952
Piece of it is a piece

2980
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:20,512
Of his journey there

2981
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:22,560
But that's that's

2982
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:24,096
Is

2983
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:25,376
Wildly simplest

2984
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:28,192
The idea that most of what motivated

2985
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:29,472
Anti-hillary

2986
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:31,264
I think it was a part of

2987
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:32,800
But I don't think

2988
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:37,152
50 Whispers in the ear from Rodger Stone

2989
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:37,920
We're like

2990
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:44,576
I understand that is motivation

2991
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,368
Partially

2992
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,648
Is negative Hillary

2993
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:49,696
But more of it

2994
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
Pro Trump

2995
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:51,744
Based on

2996
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:55,328
You've been told about what Trump will do to

2997
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,864
To be fake globalist

2998
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,168
What he's going to do in the world stage

2999
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:03,264
The idea that he's going to leave office like so long

3000
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:04,544
It's nonsense

3001
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,616
I don't think

3002
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:09,664
Well I don't disagree

3003
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:12,480
I think my I think my

3004
02:30:13,248 --> 02:30:15,040
My view on it is of course not

3005
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,064
Simplistic

3006
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,600
It's just that they hate

3007
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,416
My view on it is that

3008
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:21,440
Because of

3009
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:22,208
Their hatred

3010
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,512
As a linchpin

3011
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:25,792
Of their beliefs as

3012
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:27,328
For twenty years

3013
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,120
Yeah

3014
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:30,912
That they could not

3015
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:32,192
Abandon

3016
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:32,960
Without

3017
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:33,984
Great person

3018
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:37,312
So they were primed for the con man

3019
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:42,944
Of the

3020
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:49,600
Vicious weirdos the Rogues gallery that Alex Jones

3021
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:51,136
Never

3022
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,696
Is Larry nickel

3023
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:54,464
Scores

3024
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,000
All these other people like

3025
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:57,536
Steve pieczenik is now on the out

3026
02:30:58,048 --> 02:31:00,096
Yep.

3027
02:31:00,352 --> 02:31:04,960
Documented the last like three appearance of the two of them

3028
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:09,056
He's doing this Las Vegas

3029
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,360
Probably not

3030
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,384
You going to be

3031
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:13,408
Hanging

3032
02:31:13,664 --> 02:31:18,272
In the near future I'm not entirely sure Ron Paul was on the other day had a f******

3033
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:20,320
I don't know if

3034
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,600
Ron Paul is like

3035
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:22,368
Alex

3036
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:26,464
And him are going to be tight

3037
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,488
Anymore

3038
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,304
Rodger Stones a different quantity e

3039
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:35,680
Amorphous blob of whatever the f*** you want knows where his bread is buttered

3040
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:39,264
Now at more than the other part of Trumps

3041
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:41,056
Right though he

3042
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:42,080
Sort of irrelevant

3043
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:44,896
Oldies like old-time weirdos

3044
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,224
Really the one who'd never

3045
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:49,248
That is the problem

3046
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,528
Is there a nickel

3047
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:52,576
And ideas

3048
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,344
I mean it

3049
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:57,696
Like it's not to say that's the reason

3050
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:04,096
Trying to get to is if it's the most attractive most universal

3051
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:07,424
But I mean more of

3052
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,448
Two cards of their beliefs

3053
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:09,728
Which is not

3054
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:13,312
And any little thing

3055
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,336
You don't have the card

3056
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:18,176
Now he kills dog

3057
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
Yep

3058
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,696
We cracked the case

3059
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:32,000
It's like it's like a

3060
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:34,048
Anti-hillary was

3061
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:34,816
The Cornerstone

3062
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,608
If you pull that

3063
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,144
Then everything

3064
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:39,936
So they didn't have

3065
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:40,704
Chance

3066
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,472
Because they

3067
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:43,776
Could not post if you actually

3068
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:45,312
Get those people to say

3069
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:47,360
Will Hillary would be better than

3070
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,152
That means

3071
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:50,432
Hillary is better than

3072
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:53,248
And they cannot believe

3073
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,784
They can't abide by that

3074
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,624
Cuz that would destroy their she is the worst human being ever

3075
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:04,768
Suggest to them that maybe there is a career politician

3076
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:07,072
Who's better than a non career politician

3077
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:09,888
Any of these people for them to not vote

3078
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:11,424
The people who hate Hillary

3079
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,192
So f******

3080
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:13,984
For them to not vote

3081
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:15,008
Gangster

3082
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,032
Is

3083
02:33:16,288 --> 02:33:16,800
Insane to them

3084
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:18,336
That's pop

3085
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:20,896
What's that's compelling

3086
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:22,176
Which again is why he

3087
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,200
Could not fit out the

3088
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:25,504
This election now

3089
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,528
420

3090
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:29,088
He hasn't

3091
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:32,416
Is is Associates have he gets

3092
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:35,232
Distracted

3093
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:38,304
Granted Hillary is Hillary

3094
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,328
She's also a witch

3095
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:40,096
Great

3096
02:33:40,352 --> 02:33:43,168
She and the Real Housewives of New Jersey

3097
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,984
Nono's Linda bloodworth-thomason

3098
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:46,752
They're all the same

3099
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,544
F****** design

3100
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:51,360
The only rebuttal I would make to that cuz I

3101
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,640
Mostly grievers

3102
02:33:54,176 --> 02:33:54,944
Even if

3103
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:56,480
Anti-hillary stop

3104
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,504
Cornerstone

3105
02:33:58,784 --> 02:33:59,808
The other stones

3106
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:03,392
Without them you don't have ability you don't have a building

3107
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,160
Bright

3108
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:10,816
You don't have a building without the other Stone even if there's one that holds everything up the other ones are necessary for the

3109
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,840
Construction

3110
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:13,120
And those other ones

3111
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,168
AR

3112
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,728
I mean they're all

3113
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:19,008
Is but absolutely

3114
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:22,080
It's fascinating to me

3115
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:25,920
I mean I want to get back to the episode that we were just

3116
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:27,968
This conversation is good and all but like

3117
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:32,832
It's not as though it's as though nobody's ever had the autopsy of

3118
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:39,232
People really hated Hitler right that's a little that's not a groundbreaking

3119
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:43,072
Absolute

3120
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:45,120
Don't discount that at all

3121
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:47,424
I think there is a

3122
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:48,704
Truth to that

3123
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,984
But the other thing

3124
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:51,008
Is that

3125
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:54,336
What we what we've just witnessed

3126
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:56,640
In this episode

3127
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:58,176
Alex Jones

3128
02:34:58,432 --> 02:34:59,968
Bees very willing to be lied to

3129
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,600
So opposed

3130
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:07,392
To the idea of someone in

3131
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:08,160
Impugning Russia

3132
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:11,232
Like I want to bring that back

3133
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,256
Here really quick

3134
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:15,072
Yeah in the sense that that is the only thing

3135
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:16,096
He really can't app

3136
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:17,120
In

3137
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:18,912
Dr. Galas

3138
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:19,936
Tripped

3139
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:21,216
Has it worked

3140
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:25,056
Like he doesn't even Rabat necessarily the idea that

3141
02:35:25,312 --> 02:35:25,824
There were

3142
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,360
Syrian oil fields

3143
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,896
Is that Bashar al-assad

3144
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:32,480
Set people to fix so they could sell oil

3145
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:36,320
He doesn't even respond to that except

3146
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:39,392
You say Michael in says that us is behind it

3147
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:41,184
That's true

3148
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,232
The only thing is like this is stupid

3149
02:35:43,488 --> 02:35:44,768
Is the idea that Russia is

3150
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:48,608
Is involved to me that indicates

3151
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:53,984
It's much more

3152
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:57,056
Problematic

3153
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:59,104
Goddamn thing about the other things that he said like

3154
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:02,688
He doesn't know anything about turkey

3155
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,504
He doesn't know anything about

3156
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,296
These people Russia is the only thing that he

3157
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:08,832
He does think he knows any

3158
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,136
The only thing

3159
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:17,792
He has big pun about claim

3160
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:19,840
Absolutely

3161
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:20,864
So he thinks

3162
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,400
She has that piece of information

3163
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:25,216
Witches

3164
02:36:25,472 --> 02:36:25,984
Fighting back at

3165
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,264
Step on that point

3166
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:33,152
F****** off the reservation

3167
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:37,760
Siri on Siri

3168
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,832
Franklin

3169
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,368
He has no idea what

3170
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,648
Bashar al-assad

3171
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:44,416
Actually does

3172
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:45,440
No

3173
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:46,464
He thinks that he wants

3174
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:47,488
Go back to Britain

3175
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:50,560
Look at mean Workwear spiraling a lot

3176
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:54,400
It's f***** up

3177
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:59,008
It's so f***** up and it's not like

3178
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:02,336
I mean we can come back to this 100 if

3179
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,360
Sometimes but it's like

3180
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:05,664
Okay

3181
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,688
I get it

3182
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:07,968
I'm going

3183
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:09,760
Crazy

3184
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:13,344
No I know

3185
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,136
Penolak

3186
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:17,696
I get I get the idea that people think

3187
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:20,000
Like I have friends who are like what are you doing

3188
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:23,840
I run into people I used to do stand-up with and they're like

3189
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:29,728
What have you been doing

3190
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:36,128
Just about everything else because I am an intensely

3191
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:38,944
This is the thread

3192
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:42,272
Really is

3193
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:43,808
Now granted

3194
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:46,624
That's red that's a loser is like

3195
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:50,464
If we could hack Breitbart emails

3196
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,744
Break BuzzFeed

3197
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:56,352
If we could get

3198
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,632
A data dump

3199
02:37:57,888 --> 02:37:58,656
Like

3200
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:05,056
It would be so much easier going on context clues and his actual word

3201
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:07,360
Yeah I legitimately think

3202
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:09,152
This is the loosest

3203
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:12,736
Thread unravels everything that's right I think that

3204
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:13,760
From

3205
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:15,296
Experience from listening to him

3206
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,320
From understanding what he

3207
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:17,344
He's talking about

3208
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,392
A people even who

3209
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:20,928
There are so many people who dis

3210
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:22,208
Alex Jones

3211
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:25,536
Crazy he's a crazy

3212
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,840
0 people

3213
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:31,680
Think that they know something about Alex Jones

3214
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:33,728
VIP don't know who Steve pieczenik

3215
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:37,056
Like it's right there

3216
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:38,336
They don't know who

3217
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:40,128
They don't know Rodger Stones influence

3218
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:43,968
Like we talked about earlier to spell his name

3219
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:47,808
You do a podcast about

3220
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:50,624
I've always pronounced it

3221
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:54,464
Troyer this cuz Vince

3222
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:58,048
Minimates

3223
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:02,656
There there

3224
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:06,496
I'm I'm

3225
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:07,776
Maybe going crazy

3226
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,080
But the only reason is

3227
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,616
I'm a hundred percent can

3228
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,152
Zeze

3229
02:39:13,664 --> 02:39:14,688
Circumstantial

3230
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,712
Pieces of evidence

3231
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:16,480
Build up

3232
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:17,248
2

3233
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:19,040
A very compelling

3234
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:21,344
And the compelling argument is

3235
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,624
But there is a group

3236
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,416
Call the 45 group

3237
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,952
Rodger Stone

3238
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:27,232
And Steve pieczenik

3239
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:29,024
Have admitted to being a part of

3240
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,120
On Alex Jones Show

3241
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:34,656
In Russian interests

3242
02:39:34,912 --> 02:39:36,192
Then they are an American enter

3243
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:37,984
Right and what they have done

3244
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:39,008
Is concoct

3245
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:41,312
Crazy bulshit narrative

3246
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,592
That they have

3247
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:44,896
Convince Alex Jones

3248
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:47,712
Is true and they're using him because

3249
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:50,272
Let me let's go back to our first f****** episode

3250
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:53,088
One of the things I made very clear on the first episode is it

3251
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,136
Alex Jones is incredibly Talent

3252
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:58,720
Yes very good at this propaganda game that he plays

3253
02:39:58,976 --> 02:39:59,744
And I don't

3254
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:00,512
I don't

3255
02:40:00,768 --> 02:40:02,304
I don't take that back at all

3256
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,096
100 and something episodes into this

3257
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,632
He's very good

3258
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:08,960
And if they recognize that and are using him as a weapon

3259
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:09,984
Now

3260
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,008
Your point

3261
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:12,544
That he had no shot

3262
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:13,824
There's no chance

3263
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:15,872
But things could have gone better

3264
02:40:16,384 --> 02:40:16,896
That is

3265
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:18,688
A difference of opinion

3266
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:20,480
If you might be right I might be right

3267
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:23,552
Impossible

3268
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:28,928
Take down your arms but either it's also a glass half full glass half empty

3269
02:40:29,184 --> 02:40:30,464
Course

3270
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,488
Not is

3271
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:34,304
If you were

3272
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:37,632
To pull off a massive scam

3273
02:40:38,144 --> 02:40:39,680
If you were trying

3274
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:43,520
Do something really f***** up

3275
02:40:44,288 --> 02:40:46,592
Alex Jones is amazing person to have on your side

3276
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:47,616
Yeah

3277
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:48,640
I mean

3278
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:50,688
A white

3279
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,808
Clear ultimate disagreement on this

3280
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:56,576
Is

3281
02:40:56,832 --> 02:40:57,856
Nothing to do with

3282
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,416
Any of the circumstantial evidence

3283
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,720
It is that

3284
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
I just

3285
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,304
Have such a hard time accepting

3286
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:10,144
But they actually pulled off this oceans11 scam

3287
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:16,032
But that's that's where Cambridge analytica

3288
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:21,152
That they would act

3289
02:41:21,408 --> 02:41:22,688
We be able to pull off

3290
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,992
East of the century

3291
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:27,040
Steal the president here's the thing

3292
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,344
They didn't

3293
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:33,696
Cambridge analytica in the Mercers dead

3294
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,488
They did

3295
02:41:35,744 --> 02:41:37,024
The actual height

3296
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:38,560
Alex Jones

3297
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,584
Is dyspraxia

3298
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:43,168
Alex Jones it was running the

3299
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:48,800
Hey look over here and the reasons it right it gives away the bank robbery

3300
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:49,568
Is because

3301
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:51,104
He's so obvious about it

3302
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:57,504
Yeah that is the point I'm trying to make I believe

3303
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,784
Oceans 12

3304
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:02,112
Movie is which

3305
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:04,672
People who are actually cracking the safe

3306
02:42:05,184 --> 02:42:06,976
Cambridge analytica

3307
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:09,536
Jared

3308
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:12,608
These are the people who are actually the ones who

3309
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:13,376
Involved

3310
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:17,984
Alex Jones

3311
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,264
What is f****** hon

3312
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:25,664
Jimmy Caan son of course our analysis wind up being the brother of a famous person in the

3313
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:26,944
Son of a favor

3314
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:27,712
Exactly

3315
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:28,736
Perfect

3316
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:35,392
Considering the world we live in

3317
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:36,416
We're looking at this

3318
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:37,696
In terms of like

3319
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,232
You know

3320
02:42:39,744 --> 02:42:43,328
A lot of really serious people only want to focus on what happened to

3321
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:44,352
But the safe

3322
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:46,400
Very valid

3323
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:47,936
Point of Investigation

3324
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:50,752
And quite frankly I think it's a part of investigation that I

3325
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:56,128
Mueller well I wish

3326
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:57,152
Probably not

3327
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:59,712
I was looking at that well

3328
02:43:00,992 --> 02:43:02,784
Help with is

3329
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:04,064
Review the tapes

3330
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:04,832
Brunswick

3331
02:43:05,088 --> 02:43:11,232
Casino where there's people acting real weird

3332
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:14,816
Interesting

3333
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,144
Let's listen to what they were doing a couple months before

3334
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:25,056
And all turns out they recorded all the things they were doing a couple months before and they're basically laying up

3335
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:26,336
Everything that ends up have

3336
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:30,176
Who is the guy with a backpack

3337
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:31,968
Is that what's going on

3338
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:39,648
The demolitions expert

3339
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:41,184
Alright great job.

3340
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:41,952
Look

3341
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:46,816
I don't think we're spiraling way out of control but

3342
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:48,096
I'm just

3343
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:52,448
Unbelievably fascinated horrified by all the stuff that we

3344
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:53,216
We talked about

3345
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:53,984
Edit

3346
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:55,520
It's such a

3347
02:43:56,032 --> 02:43:56,544
Elite

3348
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,080
It's such a jump

3349
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:00,640
I have to

3350
02:44:00,896 --> 02:44:02,176
To be skeptical otherwise

3351
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,200
I feel like I'm

3352
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,992
Start get into a place of magic

3353
02:44:05,504 --> 02:44:06,016
Thinking

3354
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:10,880
Missouri health

3355
02:44:11,136 --> 02:44:12,416
Against this because

3356
02:44:14,976 --> 02:44:15,744
A compass

3357
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:16,512
Scentsy

3358
02:44:16,768 --> 02:44:17,536
That I am

3359
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:20,608
Unwilling to accept

3360
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,448
If they were actually this

3361
02:44:25,216 --> 02:44:25,984
If people

3362
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:30,080
It seems as though a lot more wood

3363
02:44:30,336 --> 02:44:30,848
Get done

3364
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,176
But from my understanding so much of History

3365
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:37,248
Century

3366
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:41,600
You're welcome

3367
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:44,416
But you're talking about

3368
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:45,696
Capable of

3369
02:44:46,464 --> 02:44:46,976
Securing this

3370
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:48,512
Years

3371
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:51,840
Disinformation campaign against Alex

3372
02:44:52,864 --> 02:44:54,144
With without breaking

3373
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:58,240
What

3374
02:44:58,752 --> 02:45:03,872
Thanks SNL sketch without breaking your misinterpreting

3375
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:04,896
Okay alright

3376
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:08,736
Steve pieczenik is involvement in the scam

3377
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:10,016
It's probably much

3378
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:11,552
More recent than his entire

3379
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:12,576
History on Infowars

3380
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:14,624
It's not like he was there years

3381
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:15,648
Planted in advance

3382
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:22,304
I'm still talking about the same people

3383
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:26,400
Who was hit the nas

3384
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:28,704
Righttime

3385
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,240
Did just have to hit that booster

3386
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:32,544
At just the right time as they did

3387
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:37,408
That's the entire race

3388
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:38,688
Even given

3389
02:45:39,200 --> 02:45:41,760
Inkling of like hey by the way I talked

3390
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:45,344
Because stone is realize like this is a better gig

3391
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:46,880
Stoners

3392
02:45:47,136 --> 02:45:53,280
Like you realize I think that's like Infowars dirty sleazy f****** dude

3393
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:59,680
This is much better for me I make money

3394
02:45:59,936 --> 02:46:03,264
Be involved in politics

3395
02:46:03,775 --> 02:46:07,615
That's what it seems to me is what's going on is much lower Stakes

3396
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:11,199
It's not going to get him in front of the house intelligence committee

3397
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:12,479
Most likely

3398
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:14,783
I think that Steve pieczenik is gone

3399
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:18,623
Off the reservation he's going nuts with the like

3400
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:20,159
He's doing his own game

3401
02:46:23,487 --> 02:46:26,559
Right Riemann him on the hurricane right now

3402
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:32,959
Oh hey let's Double Down hook

3403
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:35,519
You got intimidated out of

3404
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:39,359
Pretty sure operation

3405
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:40,383
Deteriorate

3406
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:44,479
I don't think it matters anymore they did the job that needs to be done

3407
02:46:44,735 --> 02:46:46,527
Still fighting

3408
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:48,319
Like a guy

3409
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:50,623
Behind Enemy Lines doesn't know the war has ended

3410
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:53,695
Yeah he's a guy who's drunk because

3411
02:46:53,951 --> 02:46:55,231
He's changed friends

3412
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:56,511
And now his friends

3413
02:46:58,047 --> 02:46:59,583
Is Renzo D Mike cernovich

3414
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:01,631
Was friends are jakpa sobiech

3415
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:03,167
These people who

3416
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:05,727
Like they aren't ideological

3417
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:07,519
They're not smart they're not spur

3418
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:09,055
Chicken the same way that Rodger

3419
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:09,823
Rodger Stone

3420
02:47:12,383 --> 02:47:14,175
To some extent Larry Nichols

3421
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:15,711
Alex is just

3422
02:47:15,967 --> 02:47:17,247
You even a new ocean

3423
02:47:19,295 --> 02:47:20,063
Inasmuch as

3424
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:22,367
Yeah the same boat

3425
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,903
Yeah and the boat is what

3426
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:24,927
Rodger Stone

3427
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:25,695
Gave him earlier

3428
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:31,327
That metaphor fell apart

3429
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:35,679
No problem

3430
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:37,215
You had a good

3431
02:47:37,471 --> 02:47:38,495
Great great jump

3432
02:47:39,007 --> 02:47:40,287
You do

3433
02:47:40,543 --> 02:47:42,335
Perfectly in the belly flop

3434
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:48,223
Amazing

3435
02:47:51,295 --> 02:47:51,807
I mean

3436
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:53,343
It's just we have so many

3437
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:54,623
We have such a

3438
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:55,391
Cast of carrot

3439
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:57,183
Who all seem

3440
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:58,975
Pathetic

3441
02:47:59,231 --> 02:48:01,535
Whenever you reveal all of this stuff

3442
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:03,327
And it

3443
02:48:03,583 --> 02:48:04,095
They are

3444
02:48:04,863 --> 02:48:06,399
But yeah they're not not no

3445
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:10,495
Because because you put out

3446
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:11,519
Compelling argument

3447
02:48:12,031 --> 02:48:12,799
You really do

3448
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:13,823
Like I have no

3449
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:15,359
I have no real life

3450
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:19,967
Put a little hole in this here in a little hole in this air

3451
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:20,991
That would

3452
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:22,271
Deflate your balloon in

3453
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:25,855
I think there are some places where maybe you've gone

3454
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,903
Too far or not

3455
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
But

3456
02:48:30,207 --> 02:48:30,975
That is part of the

3457
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:35,071
Sure I just WWII memes

3458
02:48:35,327 --> 02:48:36,095
Just have a hard

3459
02:48:39,167 --> 02:48:40,703
Like a version

3460
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:41,727
To accept

3461
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:44,031
Set these Pokedex

3462
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:45,567
Pull it off

3463
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:47,871
Like probably

3464
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:51,967
You're pretending

3465
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:58,367
People could pull up a maybe maybe I'm just misreading so much

3466
02:49:05,023 --> 02:49:05,535
Harvey Weinstein

3467
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:08,863
Yeah

3468
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:10,143
A really powerful dude

3469
02:49:10,655 --> 02:49:11,935
Like it.

3470
02:49:12,191 --> 02:49:15,263
I mean it is a little bit reductive and

3471
02:49:15,519 --> 02:49:16,799
Insulting to call it a scam

3472
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:18,335
But on some level

3473
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:20,639
The serial sexual harassment of

3474
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:22,431
Women who are

3475
02:49:22,687 --> 02:49:25,247
Your subordinates or you're in a power position

3476
02:49:27,551 --> 02:49:28,575
April

3477
02:49:29,343 --> 02:49:31,135
Personal stamp

3478
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:32,671
But it is

3479
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:35,231
The cover-up of it is another scam

3480
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:37,279
All the time

3481
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:39,327
I think the idea that these people

3482
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:41,631
Did those people aren't really that smart

3483
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:48,287
Harvey Weinstein isn't that smart in front of people

3484
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:54,943
Smart it's smart doesn't matter right paying people who are good covering stuff up right and manipulating peep

3485
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:56,991
Is what does the work

3486
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:59,295
The people who are behind the scenes

3487
02:49:59,551 --> 02:50:01,343
Doing PR work are the people like Steve

3488
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:04,927
Here is your simplest

3489
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:06,719
When

3490
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:09,279
Powerful people are insulated from

3491
02:50:09,535 --> 02:50:10,815
Any consequences of their action

3492
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:12,095
Why the f*** would

3493
02:50:12,863 --> 02:50:13,375
Right

3494
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,655
Like just like

3495
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:18,239
Just like that's the thought that I had

3496
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:20,799
If you are insulated like even now

3497
02:50:21,567 --> 02:50:23,359
His worst consequences

3498
02:50:23,871 --> 02:50:25,663
I retire with my billions of

3499
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:29,247
Sprite like if your insulated from any actual count

3500
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:32,063
Why the f*** not play this game

3501
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:37,951
It's like gambling

3502
02:50:38,207 --> 02:50:39,487
Threatened that maybe

3503
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:41,279
Explain some

3504
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:42,303
Trump's motivation

3505
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:46,399
Go into what we already talked about about man

3506
02:50:53,567 --> 02:50:55,615
And some people who are desperate to avoid

3507
02:50:56,127 --> 02:50:58,687
They're coming together

3508
02:50:58,943 --> 02:50:59,711
In a terrifying fashion

3509
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:04,575
Really the ultimate

3510
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:06,623
Of all of this is that

3511
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:08,415
Whenever people are insulated

3512
02:51:08,671 --> 02:51:09,183
Consequences

3513
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:10,975
Perhaps

3514
02:51:11,999 --> 02:51:12,767
Jordan's been fun

3515
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:19,423
This is

3516
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:21,471
Except

3517
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:28,383
Hold on one second

3518
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:30,687
Let me just put two Cthulhu right

3519
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:35,807
In front of me and now the video episode

3520
02:51:36,063 --> 02:51:36,575
Now we can talk

02:51:36,831 --> 02:51:39,903

Twitch

3526
02:51:52,191 --> 02:51:56,543
Appreciate it I would like to do our bit but

3527
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:57,823
Be honest

3528
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:00,127
That's really bad

3529
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:05,503
There's this guy

3530
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:08,319
Holding

3531
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:13,439
Alex
