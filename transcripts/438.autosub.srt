I don't put out promotional materials on Twitter

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368

Taste from when I was 14

31
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216

51
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Best I can

52
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Consider a productive way

Stuff that goes on

54
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159

Take that generous spirit and apply to a local

00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
I'll tell people where I need

81
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
So Jordan like I said this morning sell to report what is going to get it out of the way real quick

82
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
I got nothing

83
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
I got nothing you didn't you didn't try any Seltzer's

84
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
I'm stuck at 92

85
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
I don't

86
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,439
Can I get nothing good to report or accident report can I be honest

87
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Okay

88
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
I every time I go to the store

89
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,935
I try and stock up on Seltzer's

90
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
You know like a bunch of the loose bottles seltzer

91
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
To go to the store over and over again

92
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Like it probably sounds like I am

93
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
I'd like nibble on it like a squirrel

94
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Go out and buy another one

95
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
Yeah it into number of the fridge

96
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
I find this apartment so I've been really busy with that I'm going to

97
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,967
A couple of viewings I haven't really stocked up on Seltzer in a bit

98
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,831
Things that are left in my fridge are all coconut

99
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
I've been just drinking

100
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
Ones that I've already had before that I had to buy a six-pack of

101
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,079
Looks like a couple that are in my pantry that I've just been I got to put these in the fridge for later but apricot coconut garbage

102
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
I did end up having to happen cuz I will never drink those of my own volition

103
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Terrible

104
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
For our next episode I think we should

105
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
Should try both the pantheon of coconuts

106
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
Make it a little bit more tolerable

107
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,191
So that's the shelter report nothing to record but maybe something in the future

108
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
No sales indeed

109
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Like I said

110
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311

111
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
28

112
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
Is it going to be a bumpy ride at Point

113
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,015
In addition to me being sick

114
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Uno

115
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
Not that I generally pull punches

116
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Upon a practice today

117
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
In addition

118
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,791
I feel like I would like to offer a little bit of a window into the creation of one of these episodes

119
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
It's a long way I'm going

120
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
To give a couple of little notes

121
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
They can help people understand exactly what the process that goes into

122
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
About that and it's really difficult for me to answer the question without doing some of it illustratively

123
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
The show itself

124
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
If you notes along the way

125
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
Don't have those in my process

126
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,743

Where we start on the 26th

129
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,959
Launching into a bit of a new narrative surrounding

130
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Coronavirus statistics

131
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
He seen a man named that

132
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847

133

134
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
This is just in the news

135
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039

138
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Coronavirus death

139
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
This is some real original reporting

140
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Information Act

141
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Request and they admitted

142
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Gunshot wound

143
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
Suicides

144
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
And then they text you

145
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
With the bill of Melinda Gates you in

146
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247

147
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,575

Coronavirus

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,559
Listening

151
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Alex

152
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,703
And what took over 2 hours

153
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
To break down

154
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,359
Right now we can ignore all the stuff at the end that's just the b******* about that

155
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
You had a cold in the last decade all that's pretty standard stuff

156
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,063
This is this report was put out by the foundation

157
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
Which of the name but if you hear it used to be like that I don't know about that every organization that we talked about

158
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
National Freedom patriotism is very trustworthy

159
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Are a real life

160
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
So Alex absolutely is not read this report because he's just making stuff up about the Freedom of Information request

161
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Distance of like that

162
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
It's no idea what this actual report was saying

163
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
In the record they were looking at Washington State out how many of these deaths were caused

164
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
Definitively by the virus

165
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,023
And which might have been people virus but unrelated

166
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Too that I've done

167
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Listen to Bad question to be asked

168
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
Since the more precise data we have

169
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
The better we can respond to the situation in front of us

170
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
However in the hands of conspiracy theorist

171
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,383
Audiences were just here headlines and made-up

172
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Conclusion

173
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Freedom foundation's first piece about this came out on May 18th

174
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Hypothesize that the states

175
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
19 deaths total

176
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Is inflated by as much as 13%

177
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,303
This number was taken from Washington's Department of Health percent of death switch

178
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
Involve persons who had previously tested positive for covid-19

179
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,007
But did not have the virus listed anywhere on their death certificate is either causing or contributing

180
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
This is not.

181
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
If you read the report

182
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,223
Freedom Foundation clearly has an angle on this

183
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
Such as to imply that most

184
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
These aren't coronavirus deaths charts

185
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
Lexus take on it well I mean even if it is actually

186
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
13 Earth

187
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah 13% than that

188
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
Great there's 87000 dead

189
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,567
Due to Coronavirus

190
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Is

191
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Yeah

192
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,759
Pine-Sol on May 21st they were boarded an update on the story

193
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,599
Which included reporting on a telephonic press briefing that the Department of Health

194
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Open house

195
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Poh statistics manager Katie Hutch

196
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,327
Over the course of the outbreak we've been monitoring and recording the causes of death as we know it

197
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
We currently do have some debts that are being reported that are clearly from other causes

198
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,311
We have about five deaths less than 5 deaths that we know of that are related to obvious other cause

199
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
In this case they are from gunshot wounds

200
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,991
This is the image that people like Alex will latch onto and Baker big story

201
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,135
Serious concerns that this report and freedom Foundation is not given the full picture about this press conference

202
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:56,511
Luckily I got my hands on the audio this press conference and I can play for you some of the parts that are

203
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Conspicuous

204
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Distance from the original reporting

205
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Which naturally means

206
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
By the time the connection to the primary source

207
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,895
A clip beer is dr. Katie Hutchinson explained that there are some non covid deaths

208
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
That get listed

209
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
We've been hurt

210
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
You think death information Within

211
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
One day

212
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
We're or notice

213
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Spell particularly

214
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Culinary

215
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Data this rapidly

216
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Is really not our normal

217
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Or normal process

218
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
Relief relief

219
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
Explain in a few minutes

220
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Takes up

221
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
280

222
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
From start to finish

223
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
We also found that in the early stages

224
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
The outbreak

225
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Medical certifiers

226
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
We're really not aware

227
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Location

228
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Covid-19 and did not have a clear

229
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Understanding

230
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
How to complete

231
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
The death certificate accurately

232
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Because of this

233
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
We implemented some prophecy to connect

234
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Data from multiple data

235
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Detroit identified

236
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
To covid cases

237
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Earliest

238
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
And to work with certifiers

239
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Local Healthcare

240
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Under which

241
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Over the course of the outbreak

242
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
We have been

243
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
A small number of death

244
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Ingrid

245
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Word that end up not being due to

246
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
I'll describe these.

247
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
More specifically in a few minutes

248
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Removing them

249
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
I'm overtime

250
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
This is part of our regular

251
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Elementary in

252
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
We know that the Quality Inn

253
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Information

254
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Naturally

255
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Ultimately

256
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
As I will describe in a little bit

257
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,807
We suspect that we are actually more likely to be under counter

258
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
And become more apparent Once you walk through the process

259
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
So here Hutchinson is a

260
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,119
This kind of reporting is not business as usual

261
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
The Department of Health and naturally

262
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
The process would be

263
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
In order to create

264
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
The kind of

265
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
Information that people need

266
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,383
You have to do all the mantid process

267
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
That's right we don't have time to maintain our high level of quality standards

268
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
As soon as possible that half

269
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
These

270
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,767
Sort of death certifications can take up to a year

271
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
And by that point

272
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,935
You are out of the window where this information would be a guide for us right now

273
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
There are going to be little things that come up along the way

274
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Did these

275
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
You cases that you talkin about

276
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
Included in what you would call those cups

277
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Here to talk about that a little bit more

278
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
We currently do have some death

279
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
They're being

280
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Reported that are

281
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
Clearly some other

282
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
We have about

283
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Lesson 5

284
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Let me know

285
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
That are related

286
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Obvious

287
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Gun Shop

288
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
We don't have any. Currently being

289
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Car crash

290
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,431
There were a few cases there was something I could catch a gunshot that was labeled as covid-19

291
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,271
Mental process refines itself those cases will be removed for the telly

292
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,415
This is the only thing that people like Alex will hang their hats on because it's what they need to create a narrative it all deaths

293
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Probably fraud

294
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
As opposed to this being part of a system working

295
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
Far outside its normal operation

296
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,863
We're serving the needs of the few mistakes

297
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
Earlier we heard Hutchinson say that she was convinced that the numbers were actually undercounting actual covid-19

298
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
And she says more about why in this next clip

299
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
This is a particular issue

300
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Earlier

301
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Where at

302
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Pneumonia

303
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
And the certifier with

304
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Unaware

305
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Could have been

306
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,607
Currently in our system

307
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
We have about 3,000 that certificate

308
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
What indicates symptoms

309
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Unclear whether

310
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Are any of these

311
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Belated

312
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,967
Press conference from the freedom Foundation

313
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,599
If you have an interest in Investments has covid

314
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,743
Worried about the possibility that

315
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
UNS

316
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,007
The state of Washington only has an official death count of about 1,000

317
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
So if any considerable portion of those 3000 death certificate

318
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah

319
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
That could be

320
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
April's like on the low-end twice as big

321
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
I refuse to believe any sincere person could hear this press conference and Come Away with the impression that be less than 5.

322
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
Shameless acts like Alex Jones.

323
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Go back to work

324
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,519
And also to come as no surprise to literally anyone

325
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,103
It's almost entirely bankrolled by conservative billionaires

326
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,503
The recipients of money from the coax from the donors trust as well as from the Bradley Foundation

327
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,855
They're little more than an anti-union auntie worker agitated policy house

328
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,719
Which is paid by the super-rich to argue against their workers more

329
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,119
For instance in 2014 they released a policy paper arguing against mandatory six sick leave rules for employees

330
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,727
The guardian release Foundation

331
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,383
The freedom Foundation is a proven plan for bankrupting and defeating government unions their education litigation

332
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Legislation and Community activation

333
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,527
They've also been militantly opposed to raising the minimum wage laws

334
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,135
The freedom Foundation is exactly the sort of place you would expect to hear this kind of ship from

335
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,512
Their bought-and-paid-for mouthpieces of the people who aren't worried about the virus except in terms of

336
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Y'all keeping people home from work

337
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:28,960
I know I don't need to spell this out for you but to make things perfectly clear these people are paid by billionaires to make everyone else's lives worse

338
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,336
Covid-19 Washington story not because they're uncovering some truths about these

339
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Less than 5 deaths

340
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,456
Because it helps shift the conversation and it gives cover for politicians

341
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
To put workers at risk

342
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,040
The dead giveaways they're funded

343
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,184
But also the fact that their article doesn't mention the 3,000 death certificates aren't listed is covid-19 cases

344
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
The omission of that information is proof positive that they took

345
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,096
Wanted from the press conference

346
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
We just brought July

347
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:04,288
Reproduce this seemingly professional piece with a snazzy headline and then Alex in Russian

348
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,640
And that's all anyone will hear they will go find the actual press conference and listen to it

349
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,456
It's hard to read there might be as many as four pages

350
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
These people

351
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,024
And they do it because their lies are profitable to the right-wing billionaires who pay them I think billionaires are

352
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
Great first off

353
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,328
I'm isolated position

354
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,704
And has always been I want a small number of people to have as much money as possible

355
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Through and through

356
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
That was really frustrating

357
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,592
But I'm glad that I understand it

358
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Yeah

359
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Yeah

360
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,528
Alex talks about the New York Times I know your favorite

361
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Black Friday

362
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
Fix the name on

363
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
Bless you stick

364
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,120
27 year old man who was murdered

365
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,960
When you get stabbed when you get shot

366
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:05,984
You are

367
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
This is all

368
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,408
Who's Alex's

369
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
Defense sensitive support for his other

370
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,808
Of the narrative which is this Washington

371
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,368
Whatever

372
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
I suspected I was just taking the story from the Washington Times Sunset the favorite source of his

373
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:40,032
Mr. Haynes name was later omitted from a dramatic front page list of nearly 1,000

374
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
Usf's

375
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
An incalculable loss

376
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,200
New York Times issued a correction and they fix this

377
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Before the late edition white out

378
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,856
You sorta mistakes and oversights can happen and the times did with their supposed to in that situation

379
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,928
They owned up to the error made a statement to correct their mistake

380
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Published an updated version

381
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,584
Something tells me that this was a solitary error in there listed because I have a hunch that conspiracies

382
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
Anyway the point here is its X made a mistake and they

383
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Responded appropriately

384
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,968
I'll take Alex seriously about this complaint about other media Outlets making errors once he issues a correction properly

385
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,528
Maybe about the whole FDA closing down the lab

386
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Story that he mentioned earlier

387
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,440
X

388
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
A calculable loss

389
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,328
Good workout

390
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
God you are

391
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
What's my name tissue correction about this to

392
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Covid-19

393
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
Because it's a fraud you die

394
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,816
Other diseases in kidney

395
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,888
Failure in liver failure and lung cancer and bone cancer

396
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,240
Can you list design be a fraud

397
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
When you cry

398
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
I know

399
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
All of you know this

400
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:27,552
Anger is not true

401
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
That's not surprised

402
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,416
Supremacy DC's provisional data

403
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,024
Covid-19 related deaths

404
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Over 85,000 179 deaths of May 16th

405
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,240
That's 80% of 100,000 right that's right

406
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,848
The total 1613

407
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,712
Which would make the population over 85 represent 32%

408
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
Of the covid-19 Cure

409
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,624
Easy highest overall individual group

410
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,488
D75 284

411
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
And 65-74 is 21%

412
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
A drop-off from there but the population between the ages of 55 and 64 is still 12%

413
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Feel something

414
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
This touches

415
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,336
Making up numbers

416
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
Because the actual numbers are contradictory to his narrative

417
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:29,504
Also if Alex has to be believed there's very important question that he needs to answer

418
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:36,160
He's a legend of these evil globalist just take me everyone is over 85 and gets sick and dies of natural causes in a collie

419
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
Covid-19 to scare everyone

420
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,816
It seems to be him leaning closer to the David Icke there is no virus area Coronavirus

421
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:48,704
Read meadowside Gmail has to explain why there are so many more people dying this year than usual

422
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,872
If it was just a thing where they're just buys fine natural cause deaths is covid-19 to scare you

423
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
Other years they just all be covered.

424
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,968
And that is not what you're seeing

425
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,064
The CDC put out a report on May 15th which calculated that just

426
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,856
New York City from March 11th

427
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
May 2nd

428
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,464
4172

429
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
Compared to long-term averages for that. Of time

430
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:19,424
It's really hard to get a clear picture of things right now but some of the indications are looking like when the dust settles

431
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
Will be looking at larger numbers than we're seeing now

432
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Even without nailing a

433
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Precise specific

434
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:31,456
I would like Alex to explain those excess deaths missing the real plague here

435
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,784
Hornets are taking over the northwest

436
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,208
I did for you know we haven't heard about those Hornets take one today

437
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,352
Or you know

438
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Explain.

439
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,008
You want you want to get married to go is it matter if you want to go hang out with Carrie cancer

440
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944
If your whole thing is going to be this game

441
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
I'm sick of it

442
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Anyway

443
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Alex believe

444
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
The Dakota

445
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Situation

446
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Although

447
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Juno

What have you

450
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
It's to make us not stand up

451
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
We submit the more they

453
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
To see what they can get

454
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Progress

455
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
Human standing up in demanding Liberty

456
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Blood

457
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Treasure

458
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Everything else

459
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,040
So bad

460
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
We face

461
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Society

462
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,584
Spoiler alert

463
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,680

00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Selling his product

468
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Camping

469
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,232
I don't know he likes the camp he does like to run around shirtless in the wood that's true

470
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
Part of it

471
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,424
No his other passion is telling me not true stories of social interaction

472
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Always makes time to do that

473
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Gas station I go into

People that had cancer

478
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
I heard that

479
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Actually somewhat info

480
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
We already know all this

481
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Then you need to tell other people

482
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
You need to

483
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
Let them know it's a frog

484
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,552
This female waitress was sitting there yesterday she said you're right

485
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
And the manager

486
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440

Working at a restaurant in Austin you're not aware who Alex Jones

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,000
It's a he's a either wacky dude

I want to exchange numbers with this cap

498
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:38,240
Stop yelling everything off during this pandemic

499
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
You sound trustworthy take over for a bit

500
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,528
This episode and the next

501
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,928
The story we heard on our last episode we covered of Alex's which is about that guy there was a twenty-year-old in Detroit who beat up an l

502
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
Elderly man in

503
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:05,888
Unfortunate wrinkle to that story and that is

504
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Batman

505
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:12,288
Tested positive for covid-19

506
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,360
No Alex is going to take that story

507
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
And he's going to build on it

508
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,480
And try and create a narrative

509
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
That the Democrats

510
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Are trying to ship

511
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Young people

512
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,952
Into nursing home in order to kill off the old people

513
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
Why in New York

514
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
In Michigan

515
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Oregon

516
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
In Washington State

517
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
In Minnesota

518
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
New Jersey

519
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
They're on record skipping

520
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Young people

Nursing homes

522
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,224
Nursing homes artwork covid patient

523
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
T-Mobile hospitals are empty

524
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Nursing home

525
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
Almost abusive

526
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Amargosa

527
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,792
Angel

00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Purple

529
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
That's 13th

530
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
And then

531
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,896
Lordy lordy lordy

532
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
Years old on average

533
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
When I get that car

534
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
They said

535
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,064
Un set the standard

536
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,368
Make

537
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
Thousand

538
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Sweet cheese

539
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
But you got

540
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
To put the poison in

541
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
Peabody nursing home sick

542
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
So you're fine

543
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
People making me uneasy

544
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
Skip that weapon light

545
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
British troops

546
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Smallpox going

547
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,040
Smallpox on Egypt

548
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
And then you get all that

549
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:09,280
According to Alex is 20 year old in Detroit

550
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
He was in the hospital because

551
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
You tested positive for Coronavirus

552
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Really true

553
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,872
Scan Medicare or something

554
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:28,992
Was that a little bit

555
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
Obviously

556
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
Westwood Nursing Center cannot release this

557
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
This guy's medical information

558
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,512
But they did, undergo Rehabilitation and Recovery

559
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,656
More specific

560
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
And suffers from mental illness

561
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
It seems very likely

562
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
Rehabilitation on one of those grounds

563
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:57,152
Fox2detroit

564
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
What was diagnosed with covid-19 and was quote

565
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Supposed to be taken

566
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
To another facility to be quarantine

567
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
From all indications that I can see here

568
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,928
What happened is likely complete breakdown of responsibilities

569
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,792
It seems entirely possible there was a failure to communicate

570
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,888
And further his father is said quote he was there I would have never

571
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Consented to it

572
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
Anyway

573
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
The point here is that back up his claim that they're sending young people with covid-19

574
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Infect the elderly

575
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,480
That's an example of him taking some of the details of the story

576
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:37,344
Twisting them

577
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
Weiss all these evil Democrats it's just his perverse imagination

578
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
How much

579
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Or how little these people view the value of a human

580
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Like

581
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Really

582
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,984
40 Grand is what you're willing to kill people for right

583
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,824
Like if you believe that make sense to you

584
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
That's because you believe that

585
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
And how much do you think

586
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,624
People are like making from insurance and Medicare Medicaid for other procedures that are

587
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Would happen normally

588
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:18,560
How much do you think it's not that much more than a lot of other procedure

589
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:22,144
Teachers need an extra gram

590
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,008
It's ludicrous that even worse once we realize

591
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
Something down the line

592
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,152
Preclude them from behaving this way

593
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
You know

594
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:39,808
Alex's Alex has a really swinging. Because

595
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,440
I don't know what the odds are but there's a possibility that people in Iowa kazadi

596
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,976
I've lost family members

597
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:53,376
Maybe even have some family members who are in nursing home that kind of thing

598
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
Create your your settings

599
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
A fire saying that your political enemies as bio-weapon

600
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
How to kill your family exact

601
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
4:30

602
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,712
Also he does still support

603
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,248
Serial episode

604
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,320
We have to talk about in a while but I think

605
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,672
So in this next people are criticizing Trump

606
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Chloroquine

607
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Perhaps

608
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,632
We don't need to go over that too much because

609
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
Freaks out like a little baby about it

610
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
And then he tries to

611
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
Like focus on the stories about

612
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
There's always fake diagnosis of covid-19

613
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
Do his own show

614
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,600
Buy arrest all over the news

615
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,520
In the world

616
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,224
Fake fake

617
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
We are on

618
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:30,144
Gunshot wounds

619
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
County mall is covid-19

620
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Gunshot

621
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,736
Account

622
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
The Coronavirus

623
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
6 a.m.

624
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,184
7 year old man

625
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
Who was murdered

626
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,536
Can you go deeper in the whole list just full of pee

627
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
John Carter

628
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,176
Operate

629
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Despair

630
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,744
I have no doubt that he shows up to the studio 10 minutes before the show

631
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
These a couple adlines and is like I can work with that

632
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,144
He has a has built up in his head where he has all the proof

633
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
But when the rubber meets the road this is what you have

634
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Yo to headlines

635
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:44,640
Complete Fabrications about Beau and then reading the same headline is second time without realizing it's the same story

636
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,736
Alex has absolutely zero familiarity with the topics he's covering

637
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,552
That's the surface headline level and it shows

638
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
It's just a bummer

639
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
I would say that you should retire so some

640
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,232
Hungry, I could come in and take his place in the pecking order

641
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
But I don't think there's anyone to do that

642
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,888
He's still should probably retire though cuz it's getting depressing to watch

643
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,704
Filled with a lot of rage

644
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,336
It's very difficult for be2

645
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:20,736
I'm just not loud I'm just shaking and the window open today

646
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
I did notice

647
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:29,696
A little bit of what I would describe as a coiled spring

648
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:34,560
Sorry hypertension episode

649
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,840
So

650
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
If I get a heart attack then I'll be counted as covid

651
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,192
Absolutely

652
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
So Jordan if you think you're

653
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,568
You're not mad

654
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
You're not mad

655
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
Not compared to Alex in this next clip

656
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Also

657
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
Partially

658
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,088
Because he thinks about Brian stelter

659
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
In the pool

660
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,232
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer

661
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
And what she is done

662
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Related to the virus

663
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
You got the baby

664
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,192
Don't want to fireworks

665
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
I want to give you a little warning visit along

666
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:52,895
Alex

667
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:57,247
Play Over the Top with this

668
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,927
I can get away with

669
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,575
We sit there and put up with him killing his unborn baby

670
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,071
Whatever the hell we get and let me check we're going to get

671
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Governor

672
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
Do you have any

673
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:00,223
Watch Josie and Brian stelter books

674
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,039
Are you joking

675
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
Michigan just a random photo vraska

676
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Video

677
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,503
Disgusting

678
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Lookout

679
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
Wow

680
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Countdown Pacino's what are we doing

681
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
You can take

682
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,639
People and lockups

683
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Lock up your door

684
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991
Coming for you

685
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
I got to bring Bilbo into this

686
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
That's not human

687
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
I just get upset around me

688
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
Look at that face

689
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
It wants to do

690
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
About 2 months ago

691
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
Don't put sick

692
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
People in the nursing home

693
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
He said we're sending the covid page

694
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:49,791
I was trolling a little bit there I wanted everyone to feel my pain

695
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,143
Cuz I think sometimes I do Alex a solid

696
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,847
So similar to

697
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:10,015
Media kind of packages with Trump says cuz if you print actually

698
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
Islam stupid

699
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,855
Wait where we've run out of inches

700
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
Pointed out every time

701
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:26,399
Never talked about it

702
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,543
Cvlife

703
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,383
So anyway Alex has the story about Gretchen Whitmer a little bit wrong

704
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:41,759
Michigan Governor covid-19 cases be sent to nursing homes however

705
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,575
You did sign an executive order in April which quote

706
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
Nursing homes with less than 80% capacity create dedicated isolation units for covid-19 affected

707
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Residence

708
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:58,143
And I'm live article about this from April 15th makes it clear that what the order was seeking to achieve

709
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,727
Separate areas in long-term care facilities where was possible

710
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
In cases where it was not possible

711
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
Transfer patients who test

712
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,639
The positive to quote the facility in the region that has one

713
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
Which is be a dedicated unit

714
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:16,319
Right people who tested positive for covid-19

715
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,671
That will only provide care to Residents who have tested positive for the disease

716
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,767
Alex is trying to twist that wording into being that

717
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,839
Become Regional hubs for anyone who tested positive

718
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,983
This is about nursing home residents who tested positive

719
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,775
We still need specialized

720
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Care

721
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Give a good idea

722
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Alex

723
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:46,783
She looks crazy that's who's going to win tonight Dia in an approach to challenging problem

724
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah

725
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:52,415
Executive order

726
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
Some roadblocks

727
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,607
41 it makes its executive order it makes it so any of any long-term care facility

728
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,679
What are more of the principal symptom

729
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,263
Sims 4 covid-19 president

730
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:12,895
But their employer shall not discharge discipline or otherwise retaliate against them

731
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
Skiers looking to spread a virus

732
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,039
Easy to leave that paragraph out

733
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
I think they I think they definitely use that is a smoke

734
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
Screen

735
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:30,559
All this going on here is the governor Whitmer is someone who Trump has targeted in the past so she's one of the big villains for Alex

736
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Right now

737
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
I don't know what I think

738
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,215
Entirely the executive order because fully evaluating it is far beyond my paygrade

739
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,103
Can say is it nothing in it is about sending infected persons to nursing home to intentionally infected

740
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,431
That's just bullshittin Alex's dreamed up to make himself mad

741
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
If I had to guess

742
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:53,855
Alex just recently read headline about how Whitmer amended the order to give disabilities more flexibility

743
00:47:54,111 --> 00:48:00,255
Giving rid of the 80% capacity rule

744
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,303
We can set up a unit while we can

745
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,679
I heard about that

746
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
Just got mad about it

747
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,519
These are looking for ways to escalate

748
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Something

749
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Yeah these people

750
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
Discontinued

751
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Alex and Superman

752
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Damsel murdering us

753
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
Human time bomb

754
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,575
Into nursing home sure

755
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,695
And this is where I want to give the second glimpse into the creation of these episodes

756
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,487
At this point

757
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
You know

758
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,607
We had that whole thing at the beginning about the freedom foundation and Alex

759
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Is freaking out a bit here

760
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Until I heard this next clip

761
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
I wasn't sure if we had an episode

762
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
This clarifies like

763
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
I think I think we got something we can work

764
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Those and killed an old person their house for $1,000

765
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
A jewelry

766
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
Can we send her ass to me

767
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
Send them to the lethal injection we should

768
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,743
Door when the government corporations

769
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
Please note

770
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
Borrow.

771
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
Number two

772
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
Who promoted worse and worse people

773
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
In the power position

774
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,103
Now watch a Democrat event men women black

775
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Why don't you

776
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
The movie

777
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
Gremlins

778
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Ridiculous

779
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,487
So

780
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
What being under them

781
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
How much to say

782
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
The lilliputians

783
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Nani juice

784
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Won't be here

785
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
Special running

786
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:55,103
Global Grover

787
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,527
Spider-Man 3

788
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
I want I want

789
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
Catches her now on a limited number of movies that have Gremlins in them

790
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
There's a directed

791
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:41,183
Backflip is going to be nosey

792
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,727
I've never heard an ad picture he's like mentioning a sail through

793
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,991
Of course we got coconut protein bars

794
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,743
On this 26-episode it was really interesting to listen to because

795
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
Really felt like

796
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
Alex is almost

797
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
In Subway's returning to normal

798
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
Like

799
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:27,263
It felt like there was a lot more

800
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,151
There's like more familiar thing

801
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,711
Started to dip his toe back into Southridge stop

802
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
Little bit

803
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,855
Springfield like a gradual return to like you used to do this

804
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Of course

805
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Oh boy

806
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
Systems of Islam

807
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Antichrist

808
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
Wait till I tell you about what you believe

809
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
The war

810
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
But in Europe

811
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,855
Accepted

812
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Islamic

813
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
Call to prayer broadcast

814
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,839
Speakers in Great Britain

815
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
That's been

816
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,143
Celebrating

817
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,471
As political and

818
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
He couldn't afford it buddy

819
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:49,183
So what's going on here is it because it was Ramadan number of cities you know they've granted

820
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:54,559
The Coronavirus

821
00:53:54,815 --> 00:54:00,447
This was not something that you like through the entire city of London or anything it was more localized to communities

822
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:06,847
People living near mosques in London which is a bigger city than be overwhelmed by

823
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
9 loudspeakers

824
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,967
ARF and Abraham told the Metro

825
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
Because the mosque is such a focal play

826
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
Point especially this month not being able to go is very

827
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,999
For my parents at home and heard it so at least they could listen to your coming directly from the mosque

828
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
It meant a lot for them

829
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,095
That the mosque is still there

830
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,679
Hopefully this will be over very soon get back to some sort of normality

831
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
So

832
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Normal

833
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:39,615
Imagine if I were to build a building and then regularly at certain intervals of time

834
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,735
A large monster would I be

835
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
Trying to scare his audience

836
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,671
Taking over the last year

837
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,279
Is essentially white nationalist agitation comforting blanket of victimhood

838
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,607
Like you mentioned church bells ringing through American cities all the

839
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,519
State Street downtown Chicago

840
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:13,919
I used to work downtown and literally every day on my way to redline

841
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,967
Microphone plugged in

842
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:22,367
Every single day I would have to walk past him yelling at people they're going to be found on

843
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Godly whores

844
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
And saying all kinds of homophobic s***

845
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:31,583
This guy out on State Street harassing people he's up there so much that he has his own Wikipedia page

846
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,191
Specifically because he harasses people with such regularity in Chicago

847
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
This is how like this how cute

848
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
Castle the sky is

849
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,615
After Trump cancels his rally in Chicago back in 2016

850
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,199
The right-wing was going on about how Chicago doesn't care about free speech

851
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:52,575
Pig response people started posting a meme with the states and the caption

852
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,159
Anybody taking Chicago denies freedom of speech doesn't know this guy

853
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:03,071
In the biggest busiest section of one of the country's biggest cities a Bastion of evil globalist demon

854
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
This guy has not too loud speakers for decades

855
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,471
You don't have been harassing people pretending that's preaching

856
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,007
And no one is shut him down

857
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
So f*** you but it's

858
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:25,087
Since we've had one of those marriages

859
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:31,487
Denying hundreds of 100,000 deaths for a long time

860
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
So focused on Lakewood

861
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
You know

862
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
Virus in China stuff

863
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
That is almost as backup

864
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Because of the story I guess

865
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:46,335
I don't know what's called supply shop

866
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,383
For them so that's threatened

867
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
For Alex

868
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,455
But because

869
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
On the Run

870
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,623
In an interesting way

871
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
Michigan

872
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,719
London to Los Angeles

873
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
Rio de Janeiro to Berlin

874
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
Name five more cities

875
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Cuz I know it's a group

876
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,223
See this here's where I really and truly my f****** self

877
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:30,111
It seems has no problem with the Chinese treatment of Muslim

878
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:36,511
This just doesn't square with whatever you wants to attack China Alex

879
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,583
This is just so indicative of how everything is a tool

880
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
For Alex

881
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:44,191
Has is used whatever he needs to attack

882
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:47,519
When he's trying to make people scared of Islam

883
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:53,407
It's not productive to be concerned about oppression directed at Muslims if your argument is supposed to be that they're taking over

884
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,015
I feel like a pure distillation of Alex's worldview is captured right there

885
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Do whatever you want

886
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,623
But we people who remind me of myself a lot

887
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:08,511
That's basically the bottom line

888
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Essentially genocide

889
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,071
Listen China

890
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
Go ahead with the genocide just leave me out

891
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
Continue to yell about the things that I find abhorrent

892
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,591
You guys are ready whenever I need to make

893
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
About you

894
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:27,711
I mean I want you to keep doing it because then I get to Yellow

895
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,831
So some people in the UK

896
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:38,719
We're passing along with the Muslim Community in solidarity

897
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:49,215
Fasting for holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Muslims

898
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,031
So this is dim Democrat leader over there

899
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,847
Is promoting you know

900
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
Sexualization of children everything

901
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,407
Sure

902
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
30 Rock

903
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
Today

904
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Ramadan

905
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,767
I won't see you shortly

906
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,047
To this month

907
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
I'm not saying this as a child molester

908
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Reaping

909
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,223
Is it here all the Muslims

910
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
Virtue signaling

911
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
Disgusting to see the way that Alex was so wantonly use accusations

912
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,839
Anyone he wants to attack

913
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:53,983
If you decide to engage in an act to make non-white non-Christian groups feel welcome in society

914
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
That's enough to trigger Alex

915
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,335
Like it's crazy

916
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:04,735
Yeah it doesn't take much to go from just regular old evil globalist obviously

917
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
He looks like a pedifier

918
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,831
There's also something interesting

919
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,487
Because I'm sure

920
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
What are the folks that was doing this gesture in solidarity a guy named Ian Manning

921
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,239
Are you planning to do this fast for Ramadan

922
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:32,639
But eat so you woke up in the morning and he tweeted a picture of his breakfast pre-fast included bacon

923
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,271
Apologize I realize

924
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:44,671
Whoops a doodle

925
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:51,839
Whoever

926
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,679
You know whoever is nice to people I don't like

927
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
Sonreal

928
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
What a disgusting monster totally

929
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
So

930
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
Alex

931
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,663
I've got so we haven't heard from in a little bit

932
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
He is

933
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
The guy who

934
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
Has been known

935
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
To have his own currency

936
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:16,927
Sure sure better tip you off

937
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,463
Before he comes on air

938
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Scott is going to pop in

939
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
History show on RT

940
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
Just turned into a

941
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359

Alakazam

943
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
Just trying to push people into

944
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,703
Particularly through the channels

945
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,007
Rite Aid or Thursday

946
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,567
You and Alex

947
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,591
Hey Alex

948
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,503
I tried to give you a ton of Bitcoin worth millions

949
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
Alfred me

950
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,975
Like 1,000 Bitcoin when they were worth a penny

951
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Dial like

952
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
Sure

953
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
More than more than 10 for Alex

954
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:41,919
Sense of how rich Max geyser is

955
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Dammit most likely

956
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:48,575
Evil always win

957
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
A lot of milk

958
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Dobbs

959
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
Alex

960
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:58,047
Before you get to the center of the day

961
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
Put play

962
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
The Red Rocker Sammy Hagar

963
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,447
A boy

964
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,495
Anymore

965
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
This is this is a Gordon

966
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,335
This is important.

967
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Sammy Hagar

968
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,175
So

969
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,015
Cabo Wabo

970
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,039
You know what

971
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,319
Booze that's interesting

972
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,463
I was going to DUI a little bit ago

973
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,303
Because then you know no one will have it over me or anything

974
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
Bad news about that

975
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
I was

976
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
To tell a story trailer

977
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567

01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,655
Jennifer's birthday out ever it is

983
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:13,055
They all showed up to the liquor store by Cameo

984
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
To get some beer and wine for a party that I shouldn't

The entire time

993
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,583

01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
I don't even know how to set this up

996
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,543

Get across the border with money that's yours

1018

You're on the show I need you by Plumb

1020
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,183
What circulation

1021
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,871
I thought you were ready to go into

1022
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,711
Shut off my break

1023
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:34,111
That's why I'll just got to produce your show man

1024
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,791
That is brewdog destroyed by Owen

1025
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
I surprised Alex

1026
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,727
The URL stand

1027
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:56,127
Drug that's such an ass kicking is a flex of the highest order

1028
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,223
Before the interview if you start selling interview

1029
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,527
Not only doesn't end the interview

1030
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
Max

1031
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:10,719
He has to prepare that

1032
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,255
Just completely

1033
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:18,655
Forced Alex into that

1034
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:26,335
Play Power imbalance Max knows he can

1035
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
What's on the show

1036
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,527
You Makes Me Maybe suspect that this is broker program

1037
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,343
Another possible explanation

1038
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,135
Is that you know

1039
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,719
We're looking at how she is treating Joe Rogan

1040
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:49,119
Spotify deals

1041
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:01,919
It's just like hey my world this this is how we would browse doing

1042
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:08,319
Job way

1043
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:14,719
I can't wait to take advantage of a moral buckedup way

1044
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:21,119
Makeup for all of them

1045
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:25,215
Dollars of Bitcoin is what when 1001 something terrible

1046
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:27,007
So Alex in this next

1047
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
If they come back and kick Max off a little bit

1048
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,455
But the problem that Alex has

1049
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,991
Is he's not getting paid

1050
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,831
Fix the problem

1051
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Understand

1052
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,335
Get rid of the preamble

1053
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:07,455
Call Liza mobile

1054
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:12,831
Important that we get this information out there at 7.

1055
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,111
Alex

1056
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:20,511
Good being like it's always like that makes me think that

1057
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,655
You make me think of those are his primary considerations Maybe

1058
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,239
Negotiations were Max's been like you'll get all this money

1059
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:36,639
Alex is out front

1060
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:43,039
If we use one of those f****** referral program

1061
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:48,159
Maybe knowledge

1062
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
Keisha

1063
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
You know

1064
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,095
By the time this interview wraps up it feels like Alex's come around on it

1065
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:01,471
What is also telling his audience like hey this is bad news but I'm okay with it

1066
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
Separately

1067
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,335
Moving away from animal put up your lur to put out for folks one again

1068
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,919
I think as long as you take it is that

1069
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,183
Why are you allowing someone

1070
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,767
To sell your audience cheese on a mousetrap

1071
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:29,119
I think what China is doing with Lakeline is horrific

1072
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
And it's terrible also hey you do what you do just so long as I don't get f***** up my audience yeah I would like

1073
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,591
No interest in all of this

1074
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
People you swindled

1075
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
Weird

1076
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,527
Nonsense

1077
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,831
27th and by this point

1078
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,391
Trump has started to make some noise

1079
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,951
About

1080
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:56,767
Sure

1081
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,631
Support.com

1082
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
Close down social media

1083
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,639
They're blocking the President telling people that

1084
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,223
California

1085
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
New York

1086
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,671
There are five states in the United States that conduct

1087
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
Elections by mail

1088
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,303
Colorado Oregon Washington and Utah

1089
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,911
There's no indication of any increased fraudulent Behavior

1090
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:41,567
California Nebraska and North Dakota all allow counties to decide if they want to do mail-in ballots for their elections

1091
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,103
Bunch of other places that allow

1092
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,639
Varying degrees

1093
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:49,247
This entire talking point from the right wing is exclusively about trying to suppress the vote

1094
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,831
Is there people have to go to crowded building

1095
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,159
Devote you're going to convince at least a portion of them to stay home

1096
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:00,255
And this election in particular seems

1097
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,095
It's just about who has more folks

1098
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:04,863
Come out

1099
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,167
In that environment if you're looking to win

1100
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
The best strategies

1101
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,215
To suppress voter

1102
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:16,127
They're waves collection safely but they're going to have to include some of these remote voting strategies

1103
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,759
Impossibly allowing voting over a week instead of one spread out the number of people at polling location

1104
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,807
The number of ideas people have floated

1105
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,159
You can expect Trump in his mouth pieces to resist all such measures or suggest

1106
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,951
This being inherently fraudulent

1107
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,791
And please do know that their concerns aren't sincere at all

1108
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:40,703
CBS News reported last week that White House Press Secretary Kayleigh mcenany

1109
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,751
They're attacking Malin

1110
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:47,103
She herself voted by mail in every election since November 2008

1111
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:51,967
It's not a fraudulent system when they use it but it is when you do

1112
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
Are you I'm s-so

1113
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,343
Media has failed us entirely on this

1114
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,927
Because that should be this entire thing should literally be like

1115
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
Republicans are lying to suppress the vote

1116
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,535
Talk about voter fraud

1117
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,863
Don't even mention voter fraud whatsoever

1118
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
Just say

1119
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,703
That the Republicans are lying to suppress the vote

1120
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,239
It just

1121
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:20,639
Yeah that's it that's all you need to do even pretending to take them seriously is doing every

1122
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
One such a huge disservice

1123
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,015
So it turns out Trump

1124
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Is on the warpath

1125
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,647
Cuz we live in the single worst timeline that I can

1126
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,951
Is also still Palace intrigue

1127
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,351
You have nothing against

1128
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Personally

1129
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:58,527
If that is what you believe that you have to believe that Trump

1130
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
Is fine

1131
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,855
Having them

1132
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:05,183
High-level advisers and to have

1133
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,231
Google up their ass or whatever

1134
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,935
This is so stupid is Trump and I want him to have complete

1135
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:22,335
Total power as much as possible

1136
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:28,479
Well that's just how it works and I'm fine with that I look I think it's bad but I still want him to be God.

1137
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,807
God I hate this is a nonsensical

1138
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
Gap

1139
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
So we we not revisit this narrative about Democrats sending covid patients

1140
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
Cancel destination

1141
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,863
51%

1142
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
Domino's

1143
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Think about

1144
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,823
The cold-blooded miss I miss the UN comes up with it

1145
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
Put out

1146
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,991
Yeah think about the cold-blooded mythology

1147
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:11,487
People with pneumonia

1148
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,375
The one group that was killing that they knew

1149
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,007
1040

1150
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Not really

1151
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
54000 dollars

1152
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,135
Gravy you got your chicken fried steak

1153
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,791
Name five more Foods

1154
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,631
Alex is hungry

1155
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,191
So couple things to remember in terms of nursing homes

1156
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:58,079
Is particularly vulnerable populations

1157
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,639
Higher there than in the general population

1158
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:07,295
A second thing is that because we all understand that Dynamic much more stringent testing

1159
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
Care facilities

1160
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:12,159
And for the general population

1161
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,463
Because it's really important to know

1162
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
Resume comparison in Massachusetts there's a 90% threshold that's required for testing

1163
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,471
Where is the general

1164
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,751
There's no requirement

1165
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:33,151
Obviously I'm not trying to minimize the issue the fact that a lot of people are dying in these nursing homes easy horrible tragedy

1166
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,455
I only want to provide a little context for Alex

1167
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
Bulshit

1168
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
Also I'm not sure

1169
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,599
About his statistics about the ratio of deaths in nursing home

1170
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,927
According to a May 26th release from the AARP

1171
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,743
Approximately 16000 people who are in nursing homes

1172
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,815
Either residence or staff have died from covid-19

1173
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,839
Didn't close

1174
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:56,191
You have the number United States I'm not entirely sure

1175
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
A couple of things that were

1176
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,799
I think one of the things that was getting

1177
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,383
Is there are like

1178
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,431
Some states where the number is much

1179
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,247
Percentage of people who are interested Holmes is like

1180
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,527
You know 50

1181
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
50%

1182
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,367
Of the deaths in the state and then in New York it's like

1183
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:20,511
13% might be getting mistranslated is not waiting these numbers correct

1184
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,327
I think I'm not entirely sure I don't want to

1185
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,655
Say for sure but that AARP thing is pretty recent

1186
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:32,287
They're in the business of knowing things about retirees seems like now their lasso

1187
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,335
I'm not entirely sure

1188
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:39,967
I don't even particularly care to get into the stupid conspiracy by Democrat States intentionally

1189
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,575
Nursing homes because honestly it's nuts and wanted more dangerous possible.

1190
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,391
Could be advancing as a conspiracy theory right now

1191
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:52,511
There's no excuse for this kind of thing and he is absolutely no proof of anything like this is happening

1192
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,583
Outside of an executive order Governor Whitmer signed

1193
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
But he hasn't read

1194
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
His theory is that

1195
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:05,311
Teen cases in nursing home so they could infect everyone it doesn't make a lot of money by scamming

1196
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,871
And then the steak is power or whatever

1197
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,711
This theory is stupid but it gets even stupider when you consider that on March 4th

1198
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,295
The centers for Medicare and Medicaid services released

1199
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:21,183
They put into place additional regulations related to screening and infection containment protocol at nursing home

1200
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,207
If not followed

1201
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Results

1202
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,255
Disqualification

1203
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:27,327
From participation in Medicare and Medicaid

1204
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:31,167
For behaving in the ER

1205
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
There's a memo here that makes

1206
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:37,055
The clear that they would be ineligible to collect the money Alex things as one of their main motivation

1207
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,735
All of the money from Medicare and Medicaid

1208
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
Go to jail

1209
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:52,415
Yeah this is fun games for Alex

1210
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,975
Something for him

1211
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,047
Absolutely reprehensible

1212
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,095
It's normal for Alex but it is

1213
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,119
F****** villain

1214
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:05,983
It's tough to look at because these are very sensitive things

1215
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,031
I mean with the amount of Rage

1216
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
That is

1217
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
Everywhere

1218
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,663
It's just it's so irresponsible to

1219
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,455
Suddenly just blame

1220
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
The all of the fuc

1221
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,343
People trying to help are now the people that are Target

1222
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Get to

1223
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
All these f******

1224
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,023
So there are number of states that Alex Democrat states that are doing

1225
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
Patsy have

1226
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,839
Primarily here Michigan

1227
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:36,959
Governor Whitmer and then New York is also apparently at Alex's crosshairs

1228
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
Because of something about their website

1229
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,079
Documents

1230
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
45

1231
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,455
Website quietly delete

1232
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:51,039
Controversial,

1233
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,647
Federal state law New York

1234
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,975
Delete delete

1235
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,655
1663 u.s. code justice.gov

1236
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,055
74

1237
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:22,016
New York

1238
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,320
So scared of beautiful

1239
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880
Although I'm so scared of beautiful

1240
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,464
So I really enjoy the turn of phrase

1241
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
You know Alex always shoes

1242
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:38,656
Yeah let's get into the article

1243
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:44,288
The website of the New York

1244
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,848
That's not the same thing as deleting a record

1245
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:53,248
Statute that's completely unrelated to removing some website

1246
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:59,648
Trump's Administration taken off websites and Alcove care about that at all

1247
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,464
Worried about the EPA and climate change

1248
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:09,376
In this Daily Mail article spokesperson said that this was just a situation where there was update

1249
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
Built upon the original declaration so they replaced

1250
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,472
The original guidance

1251
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,336
Failing to understand is pretty much without exception

1252
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:22,176
All of these situations that he's talking about with these Democratic Governors and all this

1253
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:27,040
These orders are about making explicit that Health Centers could not discriminate

1254
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,856
About which patients they would or would not accept

1255
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,648
Based on their covid status

1256
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,440
This is about creating risks

1257
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,464
Nursing home

1258
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,024
Ensuring patients rights to care

1259
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,840
So they're even rules in place that it places

1260
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,424
Cannot accept patients if they are unable to provide adequate care

1261
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,472
Including staff screening CPE

1262
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
And infection

1263
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
Control measure

1264
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:52,640
So even in the original thing that was taken down from the website

1265
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
Proper update

1266
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,992
If these places aren't up to the task

1267
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:03,392
Housing and given adequate care to patients who tested positive then they

1268
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
The original order is

1269
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:11,328
Hospitals are probably going to turn away poor people and then the other order is

1270
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
But if you can't

1271
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,424
Do anything then you can't

1272
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Do anything

1273
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,984
And people who are in

1274
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,872
Long-term care facilities have specialized needs that may not be able to be helped

1275
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,968
Normal hospital or just a regular run-of-the-mill Hospital

1276
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,552
There might be a particular reason why

1277
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:35,136
They need to be taken care of by specialist

1278
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,720
And denying people Healthcare based on

1279
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,024
Their conditions America's way

1280
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
It's it's

1281
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:46,656
Negative consequences for people

1282
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
Who would be refused care

1283
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,752
And so

1284
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,056
Primarily New York

1285
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,896
And Michigan were misrepresented around

1286
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Because of course

1287
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
And that's where he's getting into this

1288
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,600
They sent these people in with the coronavirus in order to in

1289
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,624
In fact these people

1290
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
And now he's getting to the point

1291
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,744
Premeditated

1292
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:15,072
I'm kind of insinuating that you should go show up at hospital

1293
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:20,448
The people that took Medical

1294
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,080
I just spent the whole first hour on that I'm having trouble getting off of it

1295
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,760
To go physically

1296
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
Places

1297
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,256
I hate you

1298
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,096
Person rabbit they love the power

1299
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,960
Kill an old person

1300
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,592
Besides shades

1301
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:04,736
Insinuations of murdering children in math

1302
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,040
Kind of same vibe

1303
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,368
Because no one teaches him less

1304
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,696
Cuz nobody is held accountable when you're in the right wing

1305
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,536
Apparently no rules

1306
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,352
He does these things

1307
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
Potential consequences

1308
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Racine

1309
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,752
The patterns of behavior that are facilitated by people

1310
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,568
You know encouraging this

1311
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,640
People don't start showing up at hospitals

1312
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
Thinking you're going to

1313
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Free

1314
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,992
Elderly patients who are being

1315
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:41,088
Hospital

1316
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,880
Alex should be immediately removed

1317
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
You probably won't

1318
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:52,352
So his next clip Alex

1319
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,632
Continues on this theme

1320
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,192
I'm talking about how all of his enemies

1321
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:02,592
Everybody throw zombies maybe you should probably kill him

1322
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,128
Hey Mary hey

1323
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
Look

1324
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
Caleb at the most

1325
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:14,368
Legal limit that I can get Iowa

1326
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,160
But I'm not doing it

1327
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,744
Zombie

1328
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
Jamey Johnson

1329
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
What

1330
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
The zombie one

1331
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,416
Because he doesn't have brain

1332
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
Allegory

1333
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
What

1334
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
You got brain

1335
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,560
You got a husband and you got a wife

1336
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
You got a lot

1337
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,400
You got a charger you love God you're not perfect

1338
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:04,032
But you believe you don't like it

1339
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,832
Do you think you can make a deal with a zombie

1340
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,464
You throw a zombie me over your fence

1341
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
You're thinking of possums

1342
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,096
Placating

1343
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,264
Violet

1344
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
Governor

1345
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Whitmar

1346
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
Good cowardly America

1347
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,184
So if you're not a good calendar

1348
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,376
Turn them into

1349
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,216
Shut the last thing we want is a little hair on American soil

1350
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,496
Lycos had to be hard

1351
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,288
We need to destroy his name

1352
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,640
Monstrous

1353
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,736
Them to be indicted

1354
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:21,088
If I were a dishonest actor I would have cut that after

1355
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
You know that

1356
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:31,072
Clearly

1357
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,376
Would kill the governor

1358
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,544
And I don't think that that part at the end actually takes away my problem

1359
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,944
I mean that's just the same thing as I'm going to kill them politically

1360
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,760
You can walk away from that exact same impression

1361
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
And it's just like

1362
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:55,392
Add a recent downsides to killing him but maybe you should or maybe not I don't know

1363
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,440
Also he's really just describing

1364
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:01,536
The Scarecrow but I guess like George Romero's take on the Scarecrow

1365
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:05,376
Yeah there's some problems I get really tired of

1366
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:09,728
I get really tired of doing like Alex Jones literary analysis

1367
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,520
Lower history

1368
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,336
He's wrong about everything pretty much everything

1369
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:17,152
Best clips from May 27th

1370
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,456
It's Alaska because

1371
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,064
Tower of the f****** show is libertarian

1372
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Former Satanist

1373
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,904
Priest guy was named I've already forgotten

1374
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,464
5

1375
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
Click

1376
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,000
Yes

1377
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,280
Don't give a s***

1378
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
It is a

1379
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,096
A real

1380
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,912
Real disaster

1381
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,264
Yeah I used to be

1382
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
It sucks quite annoying

1383
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,248
So you're the last clip

1384
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,808
Is Alex lying about the Twitter stock

1385
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,576
Check

1386
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,672
Declaim

1387
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,352
The 2020 election was stolen

1388
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,728
Please

1389
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,080
There's a rattlesnake

1390
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,408
Don't stick your hand out at you're going to get bit

1391
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,456
Maybe it's not hungry

1392
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,760
Maybe it doesn't bite you

1393
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,808
That was not their problem

1394
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,832
Their problem was

1395
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
Primarily twofold

1396
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:36,512
One is that there isn't evidence that mail-in ballots have a higher propensity for fraud

1397
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,816
And the second is that

1398
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
What Trump was doing

1399
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,936
Was literally an explicit

1400
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,960
Of election

1401
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Misinformation

1402
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:52,640
We primarily use mail

1403
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,456
What you saying is that your system of election

1404
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,552
Is rice

1405
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,576
Is

1406
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:06,976
Peaceful transition of power at the end of 20 the electoral process of at least five states

1407
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:10,304
Well you'll be very concept of an electoral

1408
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,888
You back he would prefer not to have

1409
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:19,776
Twitter fact-checks things not because

1410
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:24,384
Ridiculous

1411
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
I'm going to be real sad day

1412
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,784
Navigate to the 28th Thursday show

1413
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,808
And

1414
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:38,464
I thought this was going to be because of things are happening

1415
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
In the world

1416
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
Particularly in Minneapolis

1417
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:46,400
I was pretty shocked when we opened the show

1418
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:52,288
I know that there's a lot of different political ideas looks systems out there in the world

1419
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:57,920
What I do

1420
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:02,272
Robber Baron dynasties actually believe interrupter show

1421
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,136
Cuz you run propaganda for a McGriddle to this show it's the reason

1422
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Broadcast

1423
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208
It's the reason that millions of people

1424
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,888
Know what you're talkin about

1425
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,912
Today

1426
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,496
And this is real in this is unfiltered

1427
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
Now

1428
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,944
I'll just an Australian I'll just in UK but now the US has come out the state park

1429
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,504
Confirmed they knew they were doing bio weapons

1430
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
Development

1431
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:35,808
Viruses

1432
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
You know what that means

1433
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,144
That means

1434
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,776
So this is how we starting to show he's talking about

1435
01:31:56,032 --> 01:32:02,176
I tried to find with this disarray State Department

1436
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,736
Snowy

1437
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
I was I was

1438
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,880
Completely thrown

1439
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:17,024
I heard the air-raid sirens I thought for sure you'd be talking about the situation is unfold

1440
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,632
Immediately but he does get to it pretty quickly

1441
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,936
What he does is something that I

1442
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
I think

1443
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
Yo

1444
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:33,152
I kind of have a sense of how things are going to go

1445
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,224
I think there's probably a lot of people who figured you was blow up in

1446
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,064
Freak out

1447
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:45,952
What are you going to do is give a patronizing call for Unity

1448
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,280
Yeah this is where Alex

1449
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
It turns out I was Gray

1450
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
Dodger said be positive

1451
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,240
Positive talk about what unifies US

1452
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,264
Because that's weather

1453
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
Music

1454
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,408
Really

1455
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Fun

1456
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,184
All of us

1457
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,488
Black or white

1458
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,328
Similar cases of white cop sitting on top

1459
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:27,168
Like I said smiley bags is terrible footage

1460
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
You want just one of those you killed

1461
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:40,736
Portrait

1462
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,856
About 8 minutes

1463
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
1 sides locked up

1464
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,632
To death so you don't like it

1465
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,960
All the people died in nursing homes with

1466
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,520
Blond

1467
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,080
Quiet

1468
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
Crazy cover

1469
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,152
Black beating up white

1470
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
All

1471
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
Going on

1472
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,016
Evil Fallen

1473
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
In general

1474
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,488
You can look at those images and then look at all the

1475
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
People burning down Target

1476
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,192
Applewhite ladies to their white

1477
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
It's all stupid

1478
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
The people perish for lack of knowledge

1479
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,088
Are going to win their coming after

1480
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:54,720
Like I said this is about

1481
01:34:54,976 --> 01:35:01,120
Come to expect from whataboutism injury

1482
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:06,752
Instead of being a brutal Act of horrific violence doesn't know what he's doing

1483
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,664
Just be very initial framing of this is indicative of Oz angle to minimize the murderer

1484
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
In focus on the public backlash

1485
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
To what was felt to be an inadequate response firing Wisconsin

1486
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:26,464
Alex does not give a f*** about this story or George Floyd

1487
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
Just gotten too big for him to ignore

1488
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:33,376
I can see that pretty comfortably considering that this is the first time the story has come up

1489
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,424
Thursday episode

1490
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,520
Has killed on Monday evening be released soon after

1491
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,592
Alex could have easily brought this up on the show on Tuesday if he was

1492
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Concerned about the cops action

1493
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,480
Stupidly minimize on the Coronavirus

1494
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,016
Large protests

1495
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:54,624
Took place on Tuesday police responded protesters with percussion

1496
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,928
Which is a very Stark technical difference

1497
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,488
The way the police responded

1498
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,512
Invading State Building

1499
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,792
Complain about Starbucks

1500
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,584
Enclose just a few weeks ago

1501
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:09,216
Valic scared about this story you could have covered the protests that took place on Tuesday on his Wednesday show

1502
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:14,848
He's too busy lying about Democratic Governors intentionally infecting Coronavirus

1503
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,408
Interviewing the satanic libertarian

1504
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:24,320
The protests were in response to the police department just firing officers who were involved instead of charged with murder

1505
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,856
That was force

1506
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,928
On Wednesday night there were more protesting again

1507
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
The police used tear gas

1508
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Flashbangs

1509
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
To try and disperse the crowd

1510
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,816
There was property damage and the chaos

1511
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:39,936
Look at the ensuing events and not understand exactly how this happened and how he could have easily been

1512
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
Completely averted

1513
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:47,616
The situation is still ongoing and I do not recording feel like I have enough information

1514
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
Grasp

1515
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:54,272
A lot of the intricacies things I've been trying to keep up as best I can but I feel like

1516
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,808
It's very difficult

1517
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
For me to fully

1518
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,648
Understand b b b b

1519
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,720
Yeah

1520
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:05,024
Towards the evening

1521
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:11,680
I don't know what's going on

1522
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,240
Get to into coverages.

1523
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,800
Alex's

1524
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,336
Doesn't care

1525
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,896
About that

1526
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,688
Here's

1527
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,736
If This Were reverse

1528
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,016
So to speak

1529
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,088
If this was a white probe

1530
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
And they have done what they done

1531
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,952
Alex would immediately be like

1532
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,792
This country was started because of property damage

1533
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:43,424
The Tea Party damaged property

1534
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:49,824
Then they don't listen then you have to get louder in the only way to get louder and make them listen is with property damage

1535
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
So I don't know

1536
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
I don't care

1537
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:58,784
I don't give a fuk with any of these right-wing dum-dums have to say I don't know everything but these

1538
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
People shut the f***

1539
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
Just shut the fuk

1540
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:08,512
So what's going on here is the Alex wants to take the initial inciting event

1541
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:14,912
A murder of a subdued man in police custody and say well that's a shame

1542
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:22,592
He can pay lip service to the initial is at

1543
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,872
Existing narrative

1544
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,408
About the nursing home

1545
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:28,992
20 year old beat up that elderly guide

1546
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,064
Even in the way Alex connects these stories

1547
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,856
He's picking

1548
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
Little concession that George Floyd

1549
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:42,048
Temping killed

1550
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,704
The story without saying it's bad things to which tells you all you need to know

1551
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,336
It's imperative for Alex to find ways to refocus the story of the

1552
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:58,432
A defenseless black man by the police

1553
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:01,248
Are you done that is

1554
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
It'll bring up in

1555
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,832
Instances of unrelated bad things

1556
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,368
And to reframe stories

1557
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,904
Disgusting

1558
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,672
Protest

1559
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:14,816
In such ways to Center white people's Victor Wood stories as the main thing to really worry about like woman in the wheelchair

1560
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:21,216
He's talking about this is supremely unsurprising

1561
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:21,984
Wrapped up in

1562
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,800
Being entirely about white identity

1563
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,872
People always under attack

1564
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
We feel like

1565
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:35,040
Especially compared to his rhetoric from the 26th and 27th where he's like

1566
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,600
Literally murdering people

1567
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:43,744
And then you look at the racial disparity in not just police violence but in the attack

1568
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,304
People and there's it's hard not to

1569
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:51,424
Is passive genocide going on and then an active

1570
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,704
And it's

1571
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,032
So yeah wants to Center

1572
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
White victimhood

1573
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
So

1574
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
Surprise

1575
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,968
About

1576
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,248
We just do this

1577
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:09,856
Let's just play 14 radio listeners

1578
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,160
45 clips

1579
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,232
The Looting and the rioting in the race

1580
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,024
In LA

1581
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,048
Minnesota

1582
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,376
You know this is how he's starting out

1583
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Discussing the story is by

1584
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Apria

1585
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,752
Front loading

1586
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,568
The stories about tax on whites

1587
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,616
And scary black people looting

1588
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:36,736
Are focusing on that angle of the story is a way to contextualize things

1589
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,040
It's intentional it's what Alex is doing

1590
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,088
The first two jobs he's achieved

1591
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,392
What he plans to do

1592
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,440
Is making a guy

1593
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,768
You shouldn't have died you should have been killed him, didn't know what he was doing

1594
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,560
And the second is

1595
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,608
Center everything around White

1596
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:57,472
Alex

1597
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,008
Appeal to you

1598
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:05,664
Protesters multi-generational multiracial

1599
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,480
And the people on the other side are white

1600
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,016
It does seem that way

1601
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,320
Another part of this

1602
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,112
It has to be done is Alex

1603
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
Make excuses

1604
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,696
For the officer

1605
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,488
And here

1606
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
People

1607
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
And somebody

1608
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,520
Killing killing

1609
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:32,288
Yes he did

1610
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,080
Dumbass said no about Anatomy

1611
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,104
He's a murderer

1612
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,248
Unis Robinson carotid artery Bubba

1613
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:50,208
He's a dumbass like so many other people there dumb cops are good cops

1614
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:52,000
You're dumb doctors are good doctor

1615
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
Bad

1616
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,816
People people they're good people

1617
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,704
Dumbass you can see you soon

1618
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
Enjoying it

1619
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
He's in charge

1620
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,824
All he's doing

1621
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,176
Is murdering his whole life

1622
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,480
Along with George Floyd

1623
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
I'm here

1624
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,832
DC primary teachers

1625
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,904
Alex's white apologize

1626
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,232
The problem is shuffling Blaine

1627
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,560
Guarantee

1628
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:32,960
But the cop had no idea that he was killing Floyd

1629
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:36,544
You go back to the beginning when I clip his exact words were close

1630
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,616
And I'm glad people have some Humanity when they see somebody

1631
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,640
Penndel baking

1632
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
For their life

1633
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,760
He said that right before saying that the cop didn't know he was killing him

1634
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,320
Alex can watch this video and see

1635
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
For his life

1636
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:55,232
The others couldn't see this

1637
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,864
I think you can see how this doesn't come anywhere close to passing the smell test analysis isn't making sense

1638
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,192
Doesn't situations like this

1639
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:09,056
Is addiction a real meaningful blame away from White aggressors against non-white people

1640
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:15,712
We saw this recently in the case of Ahmad

1641
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,992
Suspicious

1642
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,552
And after they chased him down he defended himself

1643
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:23,904
This is a softening of the way in which the murderer is discussed

1644
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,952
Same thing here

1645
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:30,048
The cop is only responsible for this

1646
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,864
Which is kind of cowardly position

1647
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:39,776
The Daily Beast reported on May 28th about a man named IRA tolls

1648
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,800
2008

1649
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:43,360
Missing number of other incidents in the Scots history

1650
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,432
A generous reading valances positions is that he's naive

1651
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,480
But I'm past the point of generosity

1652
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:53,856
He's calling to stop an idiot and that he had no idea

1653
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,416
Out tonight the story

1654
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:00,256
Make up his own narrative about it

1655
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
So this is a game ticket

1656
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,304
Get played

1657
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,096
I am certain

1658
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,656
It's beyond

1659
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,960
It's just beyond what you can

1660
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,776
Reasonably expect from a human being

1661
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,800
As he says

1662
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:13,568
With a

1663
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
Yep

1664
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:20,736
So he wants to do that with take a natural human reaction to empathy

1665
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:23,040
To feel the concern the outrage

1666
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,856
YouTube

1667
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
Well I mean

1668
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,696
Play the clip

1669
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,720
Video

1670
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,512
Which we won't be listening to on the show

1671
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,584
This is what he says immediately after

1672
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,120
You just watch them

1673
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,216
Kill me

1674
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
Murder

1675
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,824
I want you to check what you just saw

1676
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,176
56,000 people

1677
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,248
White young

1678
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,784
But mainly old

1679
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,808
Hospital

1680
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,088
Me and murdered

1681
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
Opposed

1682
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,280
I mean this very sincerely

1683
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:08,352
Determined

1684
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,264
He's hoping to take whatever rightful responsive to see the police kill a defenseless man

1685
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,592
Shoes of police brutality or racial differences in policing

1686
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,152
Appointed squarely at his narrative

1687
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:27,296
It's an attempt to basically take over the story by way of minimizing it and co-opting it which is really shity

1688
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,368
It's pretty clear to pay

1689
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,392
Yeah

1690
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,416
So Alex is

1691
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,952
Seriously Focus

1692
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,232
On doing this

1693
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,256
Shifting

1694
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:39,328
The narratives

1695
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,632
And also insisting

1696
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
The cop didn't know what he was doing

1697
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,984
Was listening to this clip

1698
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,544
I had some very visceral flashbacks

1699
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,848
Two other things we've covered on this episode

1700
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,128
I'll explain myself

1701
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
On the other side

1702
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,944
Show us the footage

1703
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,832
Police officer committed manslaughter

1704
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Murder

1705
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,184
Somebody

1706
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
So this is murder

1707
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,512
Dumbass cop

1708
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,536
Did not know he was gay

1709
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Murdered

1710
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
Knowing you

1711
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:18,752
Because

1712
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
He should be punished more

1713
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,504
Kathy empathize for everybody

1714
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,088
62 million babies would kill

1715
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,136
Millions have been kept alive

1716
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
Don't you think about them

1717
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,304
About

1718
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,608
Neither is f****** Floyd anymore

1719
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:45,888
Good

1720
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,008
Not all those old people in all those babies and you ask

1721
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,336
Where are the people piss upset about that

1722
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,384
Where's the targeted action

1723
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,920
Call Target

1724
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,968
You'll burn down Target

1725
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,064
Kill the black guy what about the people

1726
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,744
Like I said when I was listening to

1727
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
I had a visceral

1728
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,048
Flashback

1729
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
I felt sick

1730
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,608
And I realized

1731
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,936
That the way Alex was talking about this current tragedy

1732
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,336
Who's exactly what he did the day after the Charleston shooting

1733
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:29,408
You're so Alex open to show on June 18th

1734
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,432
2015

1735
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:43,232
Charleston on the East Coast

1736
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:47,840
Looking young man

1737
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,448
Church last night

1738
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:58,080
Shooting and killing execution-style

1739
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,616
9 black people

1740
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,152
On a

1741
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,456
White on black racial attack

1742
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:08,064
And this is one of these events that I call a Rosetta Stone

1743
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:13,696
This event look at every angle of our problem

1744
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,464
Front

1745
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,096
Sarcastically

1746
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,936
Dylann roof

1747
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,944
Himself wearing South African

1748
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:35,968
And patches

1749
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:40,832
John and God

1750
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:44,672
Medical school to be an abortionist

1751
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,488
Thousands of black people in his career

1752
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,280
And be called a great number of society

1753
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,352
Racist

1754
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:57,216
This is one of Alex's big strategies for minimizing violence against non-white

1755
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:01,312
If you ever find yourself caring about an unarmed minority being murder

1756
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,688
Which should help you to stop caring so much

1757
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:12,832
Preclude you from ever considering the things we could do as a society to stop

1758
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:13,856
You never

1759
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,392
And I mean never

1760
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,232
This strategy is a crime against the wipers

1761
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,608
Can you imagine him responding to the Kate steinle shooting by saying it's terrible and sad

1762
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,888
Consider

1763
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,168
Of course not

1764
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:32,032
He use my breath for months to argue against the US allowing in any immigrants

1765
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,824
This is a technique

1766
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,128
Alex wants to look like

1767
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,176
To broaden the scope of the story

1768
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:40,224
Psycho take this and consider

1769
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,040
But in reality these trying to shift

1770
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:47,392
Stories like these two are very threatening to Alex

1771
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,160
About them

1772
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:52,000
The best lip service to the very clear reality

1773
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:55,072
And then tried argue that the real story is abortion

1774
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:58,912
Why do bog down and bickering about one death when there are so many baby

1775
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,960
Math never gets

1776
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,752
Deploy to distract from

1777
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,104
It is in reality his way of minimizing of non-white death

1778
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
And it's very clear

1779
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,152
If you pay attention

1780
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,712
So this is a bummer

1781
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:20,160
One thing I find pretty interesting is that Alex doesn't stay on the story all that long

1782
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,184
Just got a touch

1783
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,488
Do this thing and then move along

1784
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:30,912
For too long is not in his best interests of his audience

1785
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,448
Or into

1786
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:36,800
No they already didn't care you don't need to convince them not

1787
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,664
And so we jumped from here onto just talking more about gay

1788
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,456
Gates and vaccines

1789
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,832
Wow wow

1790
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,856
Junior

1791
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,136
Can a mother Children's Health

1792
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,976
In the news

1793
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,104
Bill Gates

1794
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,688
10000

1795
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:17,760
To have 700,000 people get sticker.

1796
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,392
20% is not 1,000

1797
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,584
Seven and a half billion people

1798
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,888
Adverse reaction

1799
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
What 20%

1800
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
7 + 1/2

1801
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,496
Billion people

1802
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,128
You clearly don't ya

1803
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:46,176
100

1804
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,712
Plus million people

1805
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,040
We all know the math

1806
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,320
Wow

1807
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
I bet

1808
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,976
So Alex

1809
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:05,376
The touchdown that over the course

1810
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
No connection with reality

1811
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:11,776
Vaccine story visagist anti-vax propaganda that's being put out by Robert Kennedy Jr

1812
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:18,432
The headline of the story is quote another Gates vaccine Bites the Dust which Alex's interpreting as a story about a vaccine not working

1813
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:23,552
Misrepresenting the results of preliminary trials

1814
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,648
This Kennedy articles are in the process of development

1815
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,976
What is from moderna which is a course Spanish for mother

1816
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:36,864
Nickelback I don't have to wake up

1817
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,680
I got a. Do jokes like that

1818
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:50,432
The press release titled moderna announces positive interim Phase 1 beta

1819
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:53,504
MRNA vaccine against novel Coronavirus

1820
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,832
The other is a different vaccine which is being tested on macaque

1821
01:52:57,088 --> 01:53:00,416
Kennedy in his article rights quote

1822
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:05,024
Vaccinated mechanics sickened after exposure to covid-19

1823
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:11,680
The wintry provide is to the pre-publication data of the University of Oxford

1824
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,704
V Network website

1825
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:15,008
If you read it you'll find this line

1826
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:20,384
Asaurus CO2 challenge post-vaccination

1827
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:26,784
Clinical symptoms in 5 out of 6 vaccinated disease progression compared to non-vaccinated

1828
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,136
Which is what

1829
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:37,536
Kennedy recorded in this article

1830
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:44,704
He's an a****** isn't as the receipts take seriously on this issue but Alex is more than happy to blindly accept his narrative

1831
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,240
Cuz they help attack vaccine

1832
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:49,824
Man that's wild that the son of a guy who

1833
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:50,848
What who is like

1834
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:56,992
Transformed into a bit of a progressive hero many people fantasy book on creating a better America

1835
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
Bag

1836
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,208
That's a real bummer

1837
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:10,048
It's just a step in the process

1838
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:13,376
Super 20% number that Alex seems to be citing

1839
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:19,008
I think he was percent of the monkeys got sick or something share

1840
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:24,384
But that was about the Kennedys article

1841
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,664
Time trials

1842
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:32,576
Moderna press release which is what is a supposed to be sourced from

1843
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:36,416
In a related fraction anywhere in the press release

1844
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:40,768
I honestly have no idea where that number is coming from because it's not in the source

1845
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:45,632
Nor is any indication that there were high incidence of adverse reactions

1846
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,424
Really seems to all to be made up

1847
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,984
No one is suggesting given

1848
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:54,336
Anyone that vaccine or any percent negative reaction rate

1849
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,992
Is that number were actually reflected in the data that would be one thing because I understand

1850
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:04,832
Next is figuring out what went wrong

1851
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,624
This seems like another

1852
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,160
Honestly

1853
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:10,720
I found it offensively Petty

1854
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:20,192
Serious stuff going on right now

1855
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:24,288
Junior's nonsense child

1856
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,824
It appears to be made of

1857
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
I think

1858
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:33,760
Almost any other issue than the

1859
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:35,552
What's going on in Minneapolis

1860
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832
Is probably

1861
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,880
Small potatoes in terms of

1862
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:41,184
Relevant

1863
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,744
What's going on in the world

1864
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,512
Alex

1865
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,304
We talked about so I could attack

1866
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:50,144
So I am disappointed by talking about a dumb Gates vaccine thing

1867
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,168
However

1868
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,984
I'm not disappointed by this next clip

1869
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,008
Is this is where he commits

1870
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
The felony

1871
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,056
I think he's lying

1872
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,128
Even f****** serious trouble

1873
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,176
Not about taking credit

1874
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Taking stock

1875
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,536
President

1876
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:20,352
Cuz if you did

1877
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
Why do hats

1878
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:28,032
Pollock

1879
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,824
Play the biggest in d.c.

1880
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,296
Dried up grass

1881
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,576
Executive orders

1882
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Commission

1883
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:55,424
People in jail

1884
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,192
Medication

1885
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,360
Very close on like in the chair

1886
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,248
What you doing

1887
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:12,832
He's talking about Trump's executive order about social media

1888
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
Keith Urban

1889
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,672
According to that last clip

1890
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:21,536
What's the number for firms to draw up some plans for Trump to uses

1891
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,328
Executive order

1892
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:25,632
Apparently signed today

1893
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,424
I don't believe any of its real

1894
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:32,288
But if we pretend it is let's consider some ramifications of this admission

1895
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:34,592
But I don't think Alex realizes he say

1896
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,640
E-40 saying is true

1897
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,200
No longer fake journalist

1898
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,736
He's no longer broadcaster

1899
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:41,504
Use explicit

1900
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:48,160
The argue for specific desired legislation is basically the definition of lobbying

1901
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:48,928
And guess what

1902
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:49,952
If Alex

1903
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:53,024
Did you what you saying and he didn't report the money spent

1904
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
You could get arrested for that

1905
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,608
That is very illegal

1906
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:00,448
Assuming that he's not making this up

1907
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:04,800
According to the lobby disclosure disclosure Act of 1995

1908
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:08,640
If you will employ lobbyists and you're not a non-profit

1909
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,456
You have to register with the secretary of state and the clerk

1910
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,248
Of the House of Representatives

1911
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,648
You don't need to register if you spend less than $11,500 but Alex said he spent a lot of money on this

1912
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:22,208
The top three firms in d.c.

1913
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:28,608
So he's not making s*** up he's been more than 11 five

1914
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:35,008
What's the top three law firms in d.c. are not giving out

1915
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:38,336
F****** president

1916
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,360
Small Potatoes

1917
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:44,736
People who are in the position Alex's pretending

1918
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,272
Activity

1919
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:51,648
So can lead to a fine of up to $200,000

1920
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:56,256
There's an additional problem Becomes of this

1921
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
Regarding lobbyist

1922
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,096
And that is what I want to show

1923
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:02,912
Popcorn

1924
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,520
Affirms to Lobby to Trump

1925
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,824
Positive coverage that Alex

1926
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,872
Is a form of donation in kind

1927
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,664
Which could be considered a gift

1928
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,432
Trump

1929
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:18,272
Sycophantic exuberance Alex says for everything Trump does

1930
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:21,600
Could be reconsidered as an illegal donation to try to sway the

1931
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,648
The person you're

1932
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:27,232
In terms of enacting legislation or in this case an executive order

1933
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:28,256
Which could

1934
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:30,048
Make you see much bigger crime

1935
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,584
If someone were to investigate this

1936
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,888
And find that Alex had actually done this

1937
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,680
Which I still don't necessarily think

1938
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:39,520
He actually did Al Capone tax evasion

1939
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,288
Situation

1940
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:46,688
I don't believe

1941
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:51,040
3 top law firms

1942
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:55,392
Is normal blowhard narcissist braggart self

1943
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:58,464
You can't stand to not make himself the center of everything

1944
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,744
He's not lying

1945
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,048
He better have reported that s***

1946
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
Like I searched

1947
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:09,216
The US Senate lobbying disclosure act database Alexander

1948
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:12,544
Or anyone associated with Infowars or Free Speech system

1949
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:17,152
I can see that he could have some fake business name but he's hiding under that's possible but

1950
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:20,224
It's better we better

1951
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,784
F****** hope that no one decides to investigation

1952
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,320
This could get you jammed up

1953
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
Please

1954
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,392
Play Somebody

1955
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:32,000
Something to bad people just once

1956
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:38,400
In my life I would like to see something bad done too bad it's just random weird thing to be discussing

1957
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:42,240
Second person

1958
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,288
Actually I kind of used

1959
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,848
When I hear that

1960
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,640
That's somebody else's story

1961
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:51,712
Somebody else did that and Alex has been like

1962
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:58,624
Oh that sounds like a good story for me to be

1963
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:05,536
Mostly cooked up by someone from the Heritage Foundation

1964
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:11,680
It's possible that I'm just saying

1965
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:15,520
Probably isn't Medicare

1966
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:16,544
Call Barb

1967
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:27,808
Alex isn't going to say that's why then

1968
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:33,184
774 nuclear submarines I was building

1969
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:37,024
I wasn't trying to get 74 golf course I was trying to get something for supper

1970
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,584
Something from the present for me

1971
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
Yes you did

1972
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,168
Or be back on Facebook and Twitter

1973
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,704
Everybody

1974
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,544
So I guess trying to come from but legally that doesn't matter at all

1975
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:54,176
You're still required to report

1976
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,200
Stupid

1977
02:01:55,456 --> 02:02:00,576
Even point

1978
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,344
Bulshit

1979
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:06,720
Social media platforms like Twitter Facebook and YouTube would be worth millions in Revenue to Alex

1980
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:13,120
Lobbying the president to try to force these companies to allow you on their platform

1981
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:15,680
Yeah the subsidy or not it's the same thing

1982
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:20,288
A big deal firms a ton of money

1983
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:22,592
President to do something

1984
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:25,920
Back on social media social media

1985
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,784
Everything's get murky

1986
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:37,440
Trump's executive order is trying to take away the legal protection that these platforms have regarding what

1987
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
Posted

1988
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:43,328
Princeton's if you post some copyrighted material on YouTube YouTube isn't held response

1989
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:45,120
That's the nature of

1990
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,144
The dynamic

1991
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,448
In terms of being a platform for

1992
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,472
The publisher

1993
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:55,872
You know like it's Alex Jones educates people about a satanic eating children at a pizza place Twitter isn't responsible for

1994
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
No sex

1995
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:00,992
If you platforms have to take responsibility for the things that individuals post

1996
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:02,784
They will not exist anymore

1997
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:07,392
It's equivalent to them like breaking the toy that someone won't let them play with because

1998
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:11,488
You know the other person's last time we played together you punch them in the face

1999
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:14,560
That's the mentality operating from

2000
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:18,656
If it does work on his only service to humanity

2001
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:25,568
Destroying all of these companies

2002
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:31,968
Disabling their online community

2003
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:36,320
Running a place to assume responsibility for everything anyone Post in their space

2004
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,856
It's no longer worth it

2005
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:38,624
Open Spaces up for

2006
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,392
Communication

2007
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,952
Also a whole lot of people are

2008
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:47,072
Really only still on social media because the individual companies aren't responsible for what they post

2009
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:52,704
If anything removing that protection will only result in a way way more strict content rules

2010
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,032
Also

2011
02:03:56,288 --> 02:04:01,408
It will never really hate everybody

2012
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:03,712
The media has failed us on a level that is

2013
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:07,808
Incomprehensive even even legally this is Quest

2014
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,856
Probably won't work out

2015
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:13,696
It's a stupid short-sighted authoritarian

2016
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:16,256
It'll definitely has nothing to do with Alex is supposed

2017
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,536
Sloppy

2018
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:21,120
Fact check on Trump's tweet clear instances

2019
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,400
Electoral

2020
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,192
Information

2021
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:30,592
I was using the apparatus of the stage retaliate against a private company which is constitutional

2022
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:35,200
Alex

2023
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:41,600
Oh well use the federal government private business

2024
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:48,768
These predictions are going to kill Trump

2025
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:51,072
Sure he actually has a specific

2026
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:54,912
Prediction

2027
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,984
One to write down I don't think it's going to come through but

2028
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,544
Here are some of the predictions that he's got going

2029
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,384
Women come out

2030
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,432
Already did

2031
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,296
Already did

2032
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,624
You got that going on

2033
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:17,440
BB's Earth-like kinetic normal predict

2034
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:20,000
Alex has a total what feels like preemptive damage

2035
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:24,608
Control as standard stop

2036
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:27,680
Alex is the China going to move in on Hong Kong which

2037
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:28,704
He's against

2038
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:35,616
I wonder does he not know that the Trump Administration just certified in Hong Kong is no longer considered autonomous from shein

2039
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,736
Does the Alex not realize that Mike Pompeo came out and just declared that this Wednesday

2040
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:45,344
Is that what's really that unaware of the real world that he doesn't realize that he's team

2041
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:51,744
Is already signaled The Bayview Hong Kong is part of China most likely as way to ratchet up tensions with China

2042
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,048
Like this is critically important to understand

2043
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,584
Austin

2044
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
Nothing nothing

2045
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:01,216
Pompeo

2046
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:04,032
Cool that's

2047
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:06,336
I don't like a b****

2048
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,360
So

2049
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:10,432
NSX could we get back to the summit

2050
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,456
Feelings about

2051
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
George Floyd

2052
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
What are the things

2053
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,112
But I wanted to bring up

2054
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,136
First of all

2055
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:21,184
The way I would say that's the narratives

2056
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,744
It brings up like consider the abortion

2057
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:27,328
It's something that is explicitly and specifically done on his show

2058
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,608
In order to minimize

2059
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,656
Non-white victims survive

2060
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,960
Is one thing that is very important

2061
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:35,520
I think it's essential that we highlight

2062
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:36,544
In terms of this cover

2063
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:39,872
This second comes up in this club

2064
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,920
The point is though

2065
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,320
And their children a reason needs to go out

2066
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:50,112
Kurdish military

2067
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:52,416
Well it's uniform

2068
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,208
These are white

2069
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,816
At least the first step to understanding

2070
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,960
The first level of fighting

2071
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:07,264
First level

2072
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:09,312
The Real Enemy

2073
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:11,360
Engineered all of this

2074
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:14,432
Politically stand up

2075
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,296
Politics in life

2076
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:23,904
State Building

2077
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:28,768
Interesting about this is I think this is how Alex thinks

2078
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:32,352
I think of the time you think that's what it says

2079
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:35,424
We should go after them politically you think he thinks

2080
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,984
I think that Alex

2081
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,008
Boot licker

2082
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,544
Might believe

2083
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,128
This is how he always react to situations like this

2084
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:49,248
But it's only true when there's white on black crime

2085
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:52,576
He's like we need to kill these people and find them in their house

2086
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:56,416
Politically he thinks it's the same as being like

2087
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,208
If you guys put all of that

2088
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:03,584
Revolutionary energy into just really engaging with the political process

2089
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:06,656
All the time

2090
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,960
Response to

2091
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:09,984
Hey

2092
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:16,384
You see someone do something really bad to an innocent civilian and what you do is you respond

2093
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:21,760
To these markers about them like they're white or they're a cop

2094
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:25,600
Good that you get mad about that but you need to focus

2095
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,392
Alex

2096
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,160
Tendon

2097
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:31,744
That is the way he behaved Universal

2098
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,280
And it is not true

2099
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,584
Like I said this is only true

2100
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,704
Okay sis where there's white on black crime committed genocide

2101
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:47,104
He absolutely doesn't encourage people to look past the racer position of the perpetrator when there's a situation with a white fish

2102
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,152
Victim

2103
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,432
In those cases

2104
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:54,784
He's very much about seeing who did something and indicting an entire group

2105
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:59,392
When Kate steinle die Daleks created an entire imagine storyline

2106
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:04,000
And then killed her because he thought that the

2107
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,280
The dad was her boyfriend

2108
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,072
He was jealous that he couldn't be with this

2109
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:08,352
Beautiful white woman

2110
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:12,192
Alex cover Discovery dishonestly and racistly per month

2111
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:17,312
Despite evidence coming out in trial that completely contradicted his made-up version of the story

2112
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,592
And at no point was the

2113
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:21,664
The identity of the person being blamed for the death

2114
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,456
And focus on the globalist

2115
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:25,504
What Alex was covering the story

2116
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,064
He was doing so to agitate specifically against

2117
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:35,744
And he use the entirely fabricated version of it that his perverted mind dreamt as a weapon

2118
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,280
Against a vulnerable community

2119
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:39,328
It's important to understand this

2120
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:45,984
Alex sounds so conciliatory and like he's Above The Fray when he's here on are saying that it's sad that died

2121
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,032
It bog down and who did it

2122
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:49,568
Focus on the evil globalist

2123
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,872
That's part of Alex's trick

2124
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:53,408
It's a misdirection

2125
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:56,736
And it's so obvious when you consider how these stories get cover

2126
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,272
To refresh your memory

2127
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,296
Here's a little clip

2128
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,600
Discovery Kate steinle stat

2129
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,880
Making up details

2130
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:04,672
And editorializing like crazy

2131
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:06,720
Shot

2132
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,512
The 31-year old

2133
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:16,960
He was found about a mile away or later arrested

2134
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:20,800
If he has an attorney I would want

2135
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:23,360
She was loving smart beautiful

2136
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:29,760
Complained

2137
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:34,624
She was smoking hot that's why

2138
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:47,936
Young woman

2139
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:52,288
Help me help me

2140
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:05,088
So you see the complete different

2141
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,880
Absolute

2142
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't know I want to come up with $5 word for essential

2143
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:17,632
Different quintessential sure go for a structural difference

2144
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,168
It's in the way these things are presented

2145
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,192
And make no mistake

2146
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:23,776
Episode

2147
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:27,872
Singularly focused on the identity of the

2148
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:30,432
Complaining about how know headlines about

2149
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,736
Undocumented

2150
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,272
When was a single

2151
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:40,672
Popping sound in here we don't call the cops

2152
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,976
Illegal

2153
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:43,744
God

2154
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,816
And so

2155
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:53,984
She fell the ground well I mean

2156
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,056
Alex is not above

2157
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,384
Afraid he's not above the right left Paradigm Egypt

2158
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:05,248
Pretends to be because that tricks idiot

2159
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:07,552
Reasonable ideas

2160
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:13,440
Racist ideology

2161
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:18,048
This is part of the gigantic trick that I'll explain what you think about like

2162
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,072
How much

2163
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:21,120
Mileage you got out of people being like

2164
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:21,888
Yeah man

2165
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:24,960
Sure sure he hates to

2166
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:30,848
Like okay what you're trying to imply is that he's somewhere in the middle and he calls out everybody know

2167
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:34,176
The bush because Bush wasn't far-right enough

2168
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,992
Cuz he was black

2169
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,832
That kind of distills in

2170
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:44,416
Alex really wants to in these situations

2171
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:46,208
Like when there is

2172
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:51,072
A very obvious case of a white police officer killing an unarmed black man

2173
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,376
You can't deny it

2174
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:56,192
You can't make up a story about it can't do anything like that

2175
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:57,216
He has to

2176
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:00,032
Rely on this

2177
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,568
She got to be above it

2178
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:04,384
You don't fall for the globalist tricks

2179
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:07,456
And then when the situation is the opposite

2180
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:09,504
Let's get all immigrants out of the country

2181
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:14,112
They're just jealous of beautiful white people

2182
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:16,160
If you understand that difference

2183
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:18,976
Goes a long way towards understanding

2184
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:21,536
The way that Alex Bill to content

2185
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:24,608
And how he hides the true character of what he does

2186
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,632
What do you believe

2187
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,936
And what he wants his audience to

2188
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:31,520
I mean I would assume he wants them to get from his show

2189
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:34,592
I guess that might be a little much

2190
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,872
For me to assume but

2191
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:41,248
I that's what it seems like tonight

2192
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:43,808
So there's this there's that angle to

2193
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,928
He's a he's also spreading the worst

2194
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:52,512
F****** vitriol that will get people killed that I can think

2195
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:59,424
Yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure I take bilking racist out of money but I guess it's fine

2196
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:03,776
Centralized

2197
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:06,080
This was really bad

2198
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:09,664
Waiting to go through this again

2199
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,736
And really have

2200
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:15,296
The the hindsight

2201
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:18,624
The Kate steinle situation

2202
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,160
The Charleston shooting

2203
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:22,720
With Alex's coverage to be able to

2204
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:28,096
Look at the situation

2205
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,376
You start to see things

2206
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:31,168
In a more robust way

2207
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,704
And job

2208
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,240
It's it's tragic

2209
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,520
It's awful

2210
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,824
The real life situation

2211
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:40,640
It's tragic and awful the way Alex

2212
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:44,224
Makes things into a farce

2213
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:47,808
Does with the rest of the show

2214
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:52,160
You're called out of respect for the hour

2215
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,584
Covid-19

2216
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,864
He's got a new piece

2217
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,144
Will be premiering here with us today

2218
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:03,168
As well

2219
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:06,496
So you cheating on Carpe donktum

2220
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:12,896
Cover of Corey Hart I wear my sunglasses

2221
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,968
What about wearing a mask

2222
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:17,504
Cool

2223
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,552
Call Rich

2224
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,832
We're doing musical comedy

2225
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:22,624
I told her doing

2226
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,184
We're doing a right-wing Weird Al

2227
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,976
Great it only goes

2228
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:31,584
For half an hour cuz there is zero chemistry between these two dudes

2229
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:33,376
Alex doesn't get

2230
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:35,168
I think you might get

2231
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:39,008
That the dude is trying to do some B

2232
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:40,288
It's really bad

2233
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,336
Like I told you earlier

2234
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:44,640
Stupid interview is dumb dumb meme guy

2235
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,432
Alex is a specific prediction

2236
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,712
About the attempt

2237
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:48,736
To kill Trump

2238
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:53,088
Doesn't happen

2239
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:54,880
Alex will pretend you never said it

2240
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,184
Trump

2241
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:05,632
Explosive devices

2242
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:09,216
Spots

2243
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:10,240
Months ago

2244
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:16,128
Inside construction Crews on normal Construction route

2245
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,944
Secret Service should

2246
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:23,296
Not the president around any recent construction site

2247
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:24,576
Like the last 6 months

2248
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,368
I'm serious

2249
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,232
Centramatic

2250
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,840
Okay filo dramatico

2251
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:37,120
Decoy helicopters

2252
02:16:39,168 --> 02:16:40,192
Real bunch of

2253
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:46,336
Construction sites

2254
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,360
1

2255
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:50,432
You don't want to

2256
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,480
You got to have some flavor you know like

2257
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:56,064
Of course if you put hundreds of IEDs around

2258
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,624
The only person who will be affected by those

2259
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:05,280
Everybody knows that the ability to coordinate multiple IEDs being buried at

2260
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,304
Construction site

2261
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,608
Doesn't see what you need to go

2262
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:10,144
Just not that hard

2263
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:16,544
It'll keep it simple stupid really does apply to assassinations as well I really feel like Alex Jones just like

2264
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:20,640
His brain just comes up with Rube Goldberg

2265
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:26,272
So what's going to happen is one of those.

2266
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:28,320
Decoy helicopters

2267
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:31,904
Start a chain reaction of dominoes that are going to graduate

2268
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:36,256
That's what I get all the way up

2269
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:42,912
Stuck under the house that he had down there was a game of

2270
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:49,312
Mousetrap just got real f*****-up on those fumes

2271
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:55,456
So now we get to this meme dork Sheila and his name is via bear

2272
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:09,536
This is really interesting because

2273
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:11,328
There is no way I believe that Alex

2274
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:14,912
Wrote this intro

2275
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:20,544
Absolutely disguise script

2276
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,336
Well rarely does an ad

2277
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:23,360
Occasionally

2278
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,664
Surpass the original

2279
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,688
Sunglasses

2280
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:32,064
Has been clipped

2281
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,392
Yes is example of dutiful

2282
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,440
Beautiful

2283
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:44,608
ER

2284
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:48,960
I'm surprised by the way

2285
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:53,056
Not hard to outdo Corey Hart I wear my sunglasses

2286
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:56,896
Classic everyone everyone sings that song on purpose

2287
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:58,176
Not very good

2288
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:02,272
So they talked about this meme

2289
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,296
I really give a s***

2290
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,136
To get into

2291
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,672
Substance with him

2292
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:09,952
It's really sad

2293
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:12,000
They're in the news Chang

2294
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:16,608
Mountain climbing accidents

2295
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:32,992
That's not true also

2296
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:38,368
What are you saying is I don't know how to find them

2297
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:45,792
Very short amount of time compared to other things

2298
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:46,816
F****** idiot

2299
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,888
Like I understand he's a troll

2300
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:52,192
Like yeah YouTube

2301
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:54,752
Is about

2302
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:58,848
Allocution

2303
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:05,504
Are people answering questions answers

2304
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:07,296
Go fuc yourself

2305
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:13,952
Walk out of my life you know what time it is for you

2306
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:17,024
It's a f****** Sugar Ray outside

2307
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,328
9

2308
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,864
Barely even started

2309
02:20:21,376 --> 02:20:22,912
I made all f****** dumb

2310
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:25,216
Corey Hart cover

2311
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:30,336
Alright you're having too much scoffin right now I do

2312
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:35,712
No I meant that in the largest earlier

2313
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:39,296
Jokester

2314
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:45,952
He's wearing a mask throughout the entire anime

2315
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,256
Who is this

2316
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:50,048
Disney commercial break

2317
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:52,096
We're going out to commercial

2318
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:55,680
Media bear decided to start doing a bit

2319
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:56,448
Where

2320
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:59,008
A contact Tracer showed up at his house

2321
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:05,408
Tell him that he

2322
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:08,224
They rushed

2323
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:14,112
Dogman

2324
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:33,312
I'm just busy being a hero right now

2325
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,200
Has great content

2326
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,808
You really are

2327
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:51,744
Biological weapon release

2328
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,048
Biological

2329
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:56,864
MB like animals

2330
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:02,496
Giving improv Partners like seeing partners that you really want to have

2331
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:08,896
In about

2332
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:16,064
Alex Jones all that list

2333
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:22,464
Everybody is taken like a stage 1 Second City class and hasn't had that guy

2334
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,864
Oh I got this voucher for my business cuz they said it was a public speaker it's the time the funniest guy

2335
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:33,216
The office Michael Scott office.

2336
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,360
Almost can't think of things that are like

2337
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:40,640
What is

2338
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,200
Defining

2339
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:44,224
Viscerally

2340
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:46,528
Vicodin the exact

2341
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:47,808
Feeling of no

2342
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,392
It's

2343
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:58,048
I feel like media bear doesn't like Alex. Alex doesn't like

2344
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:01,120
It's just trash

2345
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:03,424
And Natalie Portman and then there's

2346
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:06,496
There's also a farce to it like I said it like

2347
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:07,776
First of all

2348
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,872
It's pretty important

2349
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:17,248
Spending a half-hour talking to this dick

2350
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:22,112
I think it probably ended early and close calls and wasn't call the stupid

2351
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,952
But there is one episode

2352
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:27,232
This caller think

2353
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,816
Did the best thing Trump can do is rehire Flynn

2354
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,584
Michael Flynn

2355
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,656
Will piss people off that will piss people off

2356
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:37,216
True response to that is pretty

2357
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:53,600
Military

2358
02:23:57,440 --> 02:24:00,256
The military

2359
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:07,680
Exactly

2360
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:17,152
Alex and commiserating about how their ideal situation is

2361
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:23,552
Military people

2362
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,832
Play speaking that's worked out

2363
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:26,112
Alex

2364
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:27,136
The Republic

2365
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,208
This guy is the worst

2366
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:31,232
Okay word

2367
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:33,024
This is the worst

2368
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:37,888
So

2369
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,704
The weight

2370
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:47,104
I really feel complete about this a little bit because these circumstances

2371
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:47,872
Are ongoing

2372
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,688
The situation Minneapolis

2373
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
And

2374
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:57,344
But even as we're recording probably happening that irrelevant

2375
02:24:57,856 --> 02:25:02,976
And by tomorrow Alex will have his Friday going over stopping

2376
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:09,376
You'll feel very immediate but we can get to it till Monday and part of me was honestly considering holding off on this

2377
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,400
Until Monday

2378
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:12,704
But ultimately I just saw like

2379
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,472
We got a

2380
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:15,776
Yeah I got to take care of this

2381
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:19,872
Let's go west we gets our way behind and ignore a lot of Alex's

2382
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:20,896
Horrible bulshit

2383
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:21,664
Horrible

2384
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,200
Horrible Bosses

2385
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,504
I don't know I don't know

2386
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,320
I don't know what to say what to say sometimes

2387
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,368
I guess

2388
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:36,000
Tragedy

2389
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:40,608
I would say

2390
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:44,448
That I have is very similar

2391
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:46,752
Two feelings I've had a number of times

2392
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,520
Kind of like

2393
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:49,312
You're just an overwhelming sense of like

2394
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:51,872
Amazing we've let this get to the point

2395
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:58,016
Specifically

2396
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,320
It's so amazing to me

2397
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:01,344
That like

2398
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,136
He hasn't

2399
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:05,184
Just blown up already

2400
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:08,512
There hasn't been the end of his career already

2401
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:09,536
Right

2402
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:11,328
It's it's fascinating

2403
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,632
Well I think it's I mean

2404
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:17,472
The worst the worst thing I have bit all the way back in 2015

2405
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,752
About

2406
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:20,800
How how Trump

2407
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,592
I thought it was very funny

2408
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:26,944
And it turned out to be absolutely true but it was it was the idea of like

2409
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:31,040
A used-to-be one Scandal would take you down but the trick is

2410
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,576
If you do a new whenever

2411
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:34,368
We can catch up to

2412
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:38,720
And it seems like Alex has that kind of thing going on for him to where it's like

2413
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:42,560
Sure he committed to go but

2414
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:45,376
He's already on some new b******* I don't have time to go back

2415
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:50,496
Deal with that stuff will end up catching up with

2416
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:52,544
You hope I think

2417
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:58,944
I don't know

2418
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:06,112
That's what I'm saying about Alex to his military dictatorship who knows we'll catch up to maybe

2419
02:27:06,624 --> 02:27:10,720
I probably should have mentioned that this visit the beginning of the episode but I forgot because of

2420
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:16,608
Issues I think it would be important for us to point out this

2421
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:20,704
There was a resolution in his bankruptcy case that we brought up

2422
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:23,264
And it turns out that the court rules

2423
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:31,200
In dismissing the involuntary bankruptcy

2424
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:34,016
And the reason for that given in this

2425
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:36,064
Is that be

2426
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:39,904
Deal amount that he owes that his ex-wife

2427
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:45,024
Which is about $786,000 according to whatever claims are

2428
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,560
Is less

2429
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:47,840
The amount

2430
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:50,400
That is the value of the property

2431
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,680
That is backing

2432
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:57,056
Buy this property

2433
02:27:57,312 --> 02:28:02,688
More than that amount you can't force someone into involuntary bankruptcy

2434
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:04,992
Because what's security

2435
02:28:05,504 --> 02:28:08,576
Could cover that

2436
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,440
Probably and maybe that's why he's been talking about selling the house because

2437
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,976
I'm not entirely sure

2438
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:17,280
My reading of this is what I can understand

2439
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:18,048
There isn't

2440
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:18,816
So much

2441
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:20,608
Icon testing

2442
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,376
The amount

2443
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:25,728
You can't be forced into involuntary bankruptcy for it about that

2444
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:32,896
His property that is backing it is greater than

2445
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:34,432
Speculated about it

2446
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:37,504
And so it would be wrong of us not to point

2447
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,784
That's why I want to bring it up

2448
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:41,600
The beginning of the episode

2449
02:28:41,856 --> 02:28:43,392
Vamps are probably listen to episodes

2450
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:44,672
I think we'll see

2451
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:50,304
Four other podcasts

2452
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,840
Fingers crossed

2453
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:54,144
But until then

2454
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,704

2457
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:13,600

I'm Leo and easyacc
