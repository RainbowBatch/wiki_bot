1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damned important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Hey everybody

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,096
Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
What up

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
As we all know

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Coming

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
What

11
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,568
Natural wonder would you like to see before the world is change

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Amazon River in the Grand Canyon

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,320
Feel like there's a lot of bugs there are a lot of Associates mosquitoes

14
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
Mosquitoes but just like alive

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,816
Just about everything

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,120
National Park

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
National monuments

18
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Except for I guess like I I don't think of

19
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Maybe I have

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
I don't know if I've been to Niagara Falls

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
I like waterfall a lot of natural Splendor waterfalls

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
You're able to find around the islands

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,672
Says who we gals but I know

24
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,024
I mean like

25
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't I don't know what the likelihood of various things being destroyed

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
Whatever is the most

27
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
BMI

28
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Well I got to go to Iceland

29
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
Big thing of ice

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Not that great

31
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,768
Reaction to when I went to as a child I went to Mount Rushmore

32
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,888
Oh yeah I expected to see something goes like all my God so amazing

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
Bike Race for not being all that impressed with it too I thought it was smaller than I imagined

34
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
I was much more impressed by

35
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
The geyser Old Faithful

36
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
Uninterested Water Campground awesome

37
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay

38
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Different feelings geysers

39
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
We got an interesting episode

40
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
The last a week

41
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,528
He was out at CPAC

42
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,856
Yeah and so we don't have time not going to cover Mike Adams

43
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
Hosting a shower or Allen keys

44
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:47,840
Speakeasy in the economics in here I'm not going to do that we don't have any of Alex Jones's show itself

45
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
To go over but thankfully I was able

46
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,656
Go to find something

47
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Maybe a little bit more fun

48
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
Okay

49
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664

Thank you so much

54
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Very much.

55
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Text with two M's

56
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,143
Generally whenever I'm putting out these spellings

57
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Just their name

58
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,007
Where is the person who actually their name is Ron

59
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Thank you so much

60
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Pronouncing

61
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Text Morgan

62
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
Christy

63
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Clarifying

64
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Christy you're not about to

65
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
I'm a policy wonk

66
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
Generous

67
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
Beyond the level of

68
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
Should be considered normal

69
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Innovative helping us do this

70
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
In an attempt to be

71
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
Someone special this thank you I would like

72
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
2

73
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,191
Soundbite for this

74
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
So thank you so much. You are now a technocrat

75
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
Natalya brilliant someone sodomizing

76
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
I don't want

77
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
Jesus Christ

78
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Bank of the West

79
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,631
Scott's

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Please do.

81
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Helpful

82
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
Jordan like I said his family went to Washington d.c.

83
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:13,759
Please try and whine and beg for attention by taking Z-Pak

84
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
It's somewhat in their conception they were taking over

85
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
CPAP

86
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,975
There also were the highlights from the trip like Gavin McInnes getting kicked out of z-pack and

87
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Gavin McInnes being told to leave the lobby outside c-pack in the middle of being interviewed by Alex Smith about how he

88
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Kicked out asleep

89
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,447
Great highlights

90
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Oh yeah

91
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:40,127
They threw some kind of Gala party on Thursday night but for a person like me who's about to Subs

92
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
It was all about their emergency save the First Amendment Summit

93
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Which took place Wednesday evening

94
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,159
This was an event that promised appearances from the likes of the Millie Weaver Gavin McGinnis and the hastily booked

95
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Nick Fuentes

96
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,559
Complaining about how they're not allowed on social media

97
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
The Birth of a Nation

98
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
Yeah it's not good in what I can only describe as a huge mistake the entire video

99
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Dislike

100
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Leave for the live people just do that

101
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Leave evidence

102
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
They might be one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my life

103
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
First of all as we know the event was being put on by national file

104
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Which is the blog that Alex's employees

105
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Tom pappert run

106
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,839
I called him an employee but that might not actually be at the most accurate term

107
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,959
Like pepper used to host Firepower Rubio until they all realized it was pointless and no one was listening

108
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,591
Any pills in for Owen on the War Room sometime so whether he has a contract or not I consider him an employee

109
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
Even though my terminology might be a little imprecise

110
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
Yeah

111
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
National file with plan to hold an event at a smaller Auditorium

112
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
Now it's heard about

113
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Insisted they rent out the Omni

114
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
A much larger venue befitting of a star of his caliber

115
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
Alex's suggested that he paid as much as

116
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Is $20,000

117
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
Rent a bigger room because

118
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
With a roster like Gavin

119
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
Alex and Nick Fuentes you going to draw crowd

120
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
As it turns out they did not video the summer begins with a wide shot with Rob due onstage giving the odd

121
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Audience an introduction

122
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:19,455
You can see 12 people in the crowd

123
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
Compare to at least

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
40 empty chairs

125
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
I should say in the interest of full honesty that one of the chairs has someone's coat over the back of it

126
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,863
13 or it might be the code to the guy in the chair next to it I don't know I'm not entirely sure it's unclear

127
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
A very bad first date that's for sure

128
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
This is depressing turnout

129
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
I mean there's no way around how sad this is and if you look at the video.

130
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,175
The end of the event where we get another wide shot it doesn't look like many more people showed up over the course of the summer

131
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
The most I was ever really able to count

132
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Any shot was about 34

133
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
But granted the shot itself doesn't

134
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
It show the entire room but it does show the first 10 rows

135
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,303
Mexican restaurant

136
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
How did killed 438 about it

137
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
If I were showcased stuff

138
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
I would love that

139
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Pretty good

140
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,663
I would leave the show like wishing it a bendpak

141
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
Take it in stride

142
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
But here's the thing

143
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
Alex's Brandon's not reasonable now that's not supposed to be the most popular talk show host in the world and everyone

144
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
He's the most popular

145
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
I'm lying about him pretending that he's not exactly

146
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
Live event like this has to be packed

147
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
Any empty seat let alone 40 or more of them in the front Road it's a damning refutation of the image he presented

148
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Themself

149
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
There may have been a few more people than other folks I'm able to count in the video but I also heard from an inside source according to a person

150
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Who was there in the room

151
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
But there was never more than 100

152
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
On the crowd

153
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
I performed independent comedy shows that have been better attend

154
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
And my friend

155
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
I was not a successful comic

156
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,095
There's alot going on in the world I'm pretty sure that Alex has some pretty horrible take

157
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,959
Takes on the coronavirus developments in the situation in Syria and the Democratic primary

158
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
But since he's been out of the studio we have to wait till Wednesday

159
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Check up on any of that stuff

160
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Today we're going to walk through this 3-hour long emergency Free Speech Summit Alex put on desperately trying

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Going to beg for Trump's attempt

162
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
I don't want to Prejudice you or the audience but I have to say that watching this was one of those frustrating experiences I've ever had

163
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Preparing for the show

164
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
This Summit was soap

165
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,839
Iran me to cause me to yell who's in charge here way more than once

166
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,215
As a person who used to produce live stand-up shows they're just so many very basic mistakes

167
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
His friends made clear that no one was trying

168
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
And no one knows what they're doing

169
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
It's infuriating to watch

170
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
But I kept my wits about me and I'm glad I did

171
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Because this Summit is a pretty amazing narrative Arc

172
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
To it

173
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
It has almost nothing to do with the free speech

174
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
First Amendment

175
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Airport

176
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,767
Actually but there is a rich psychodrama but I think I actually has pretty important implications

177
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
For the Infowars you

178
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Okay

179
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Get into that over the course of the

180
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
6 hour episode of murder

181
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,215
We're about to embark

182
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
I believe the word count in my notes is

183
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
16000

184
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,479
Why don't you read enough fella Street

185
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Like I said the first shot on stage

186
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
I guess I mean

187
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
In the audience or if you're watching this

188
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Of the event

189
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
You'd be wrong in that

190
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,095
But Rob dude has welcomed the crowd kind of

191
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
And here's how he does his fees Ram

192
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
You either rambly intro

193
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
There's plenty of others

194
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Federal Reserve

195
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Nice

196
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
Quick shower head how many feet

197
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
People are here

198
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
See

199
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Alex Jones

200
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
Alright well he will be down here in just a

201
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Kick-off this event and then he's also headlining

202
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
The end

203
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Lots of rousing

204
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
The word that

205
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Don't want to hear it

206
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Dangerous Game

207
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Notary

208
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Trigger anybody

209
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Haha

210
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
You guys are at the lackadaisical thin crowd

211
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:55,167
Also by the way like what words don't you want to hear

212
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
Recipe for someone to yell the n word

213
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,639
They're not going to yell at because then you're saying the words they don't want

214
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
That's a good point

215
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
But I'm not entirely sure that his audience

216
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,831
I would have thought that through

217
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
I think that it basically

218
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,231
He is heard as an invitation to say offensive words

219
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
It does seem like

220
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Chomping at the bit to

221
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Heckle

222
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
That's your call

223
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Somebody's out there screaming

224
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
College degrees here that out here

225
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
Stupid sense that I got is that recognizes that the audience's thin and maybe more people are coming

226
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,759
Experience that every single independently-run comedy show ever

227
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
Oh yeah I got some friends that are on the way we can wait 10 minutes

228
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Start time with a button

229
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,047
25 networking has earned around and it sounds meme but I

230
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
Done that myself a hundred times running show site

231
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Give me five

232
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
Absolutely it's it's a technique

233
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,383
At the turnout was trying to vent because I think the Alex also doesn't want to get up on stage in front of this

234
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Like crowd and so

235
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
This is just

236
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Robinhood

237
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Jump

238
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
This is embarrass

239
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
I was waiting for Alex

240
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
To go to oh by the way if you don't

241
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Twitter a lot

242
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
They haven't received any mail

243
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
There yet

244
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Tws

245
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
It is not

246
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Through here to see

247
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
This was a

248
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Rod Blagojevich

249
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Are we really doing this

250
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
There's a reason borracho

251
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Pardon from Barack

252
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
The first thing it's a boy

253
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
Park to point out here is this is an emergency First Amendment summary

254
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,247
Social media and the first person is literally Alex Jones

255
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
And news director who decides to make it clear whilst

256
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
Sing out before Alex shows up but he's actually still on Twitter

257
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
Kind of invalidates the whole argument might be something

258
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Do not call attention to because it raises the question

259
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
What is Alex doing that Rob do hasn't

260
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,751
The fact that Rob dude still on

261
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Maybe people

262
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,919
Kicked off we're kicked off for a reason

263
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
Also that tweet Rob is reading is supposedly from Rod Blagojevich which Rabe is robbed

264
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
As a basis to argue that blacko was expecting a pardon from Obama which he did not get so now he's taking

265
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Tell the world that Obama's gay

266
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,887
I hate to ruin parties at this tweet is from an account called at gov blacko

267
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,703
Bayou is literally quote not the real blogo

268
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
Parody account

269
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
You can't trust him

270
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
That's exactly what I would do damn this account is a person who's trying to sell blogo t-shirts and one of the strategies baby

271
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,063
Post inflammatory jokes about being set up

272
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Tweets about Boos

273
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
February 27th was just quote

274
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
There's drunk and then there's block

275
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,047
And right now I'm at level of blogo drunk

276
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Party

277
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,423
This was followed up by a tweet a little bit later saying quote I'm so drunk I could

278
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,031
Work on the bar I do my best work at this level are you human

279
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
Like I said though this account is clearly also employing some parody

280
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Like this tweet

281
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,551
Theory the Chinese didn't like these terrorist so how do they get rid of them

282
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
Trump how do you get rid of trump

283
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:02,207
Create a virus that will turn into a worldwide plague and caused the American economy to suffer

284
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
You think the coronavirus is an accident blogo doesn't

285
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,703
On one level Rob do thinks of his actually Blagojevich is Twitter because he's an idiot and you never text any information before

286
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
WhatsApp to getting repeating

287
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
But on a deeper level he automatically accepts

288
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
The tweeters real because

289
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Conformist

290
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
And I can't put it more simply than this

291
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,015
A parody account is indistinguishable from what Rob do really thinks

292
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
That's bad you know what I would say to that

293
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Figured out dues

294
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Consider for a moment that Rob dude just told this crowded a free-speech rally that he's still on Twitter anybody got fooled by a Rod Blagojevich

295
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
Parody account that says quote parody account and its bio

296
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
He's work

297
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
For Alex for over a decade

298
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
When you go to Infowars you show up dumb and you certainly don't get sharper

299
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,967
Based on the experience Beyond Paradise

300
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
I prefer to say

301
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
The Rock Vapes B

302
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,231
It doesn't get much better than a fake blogo tweet he's not doing it

303
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,863
Now it's time to get Alex on stage

304
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,591
Well there's a big old traffic jam from c-pack over here we appreciate all you that got here early swear this

305
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Marshawn timer tonight

Nick Fuentes

310
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
And so many more

311
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Stranahan I'm going to be

312
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Peking

313
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Hi Deanna Lorraine

314
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Amazing

315
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
And I got my gun

316
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Before I do

317
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Annihilator

318
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
And there's a big

319
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Traffic snarl

320
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
But we're not going to start

321
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Thule where you at

322
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
And I get pho

323
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Here

324
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,031
I've seen this movie 100 times a poorly-run comedy shows

325
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
The crowd has thinned

326
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,383
Play push back the start time that doesn't help so the host gets up and makes

327
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
An excuse like bad traffic

328
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,479
Maybe it looks like it might rain or something

329
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
Those does what they can to make the people who are there feel special like Alex's

330
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
You're the ones who get it

331
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,815
Ashokan start everybody here isn't watching that Bears game right everybody

332
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:21,215
Also Rob was very explicit

333
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
Gavin is the future Act

334
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
Act this way way too long showcase

335
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
And that Alex is a pointless q-and-a session

336
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
Good to know that's the

337
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Setup of the night

338
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
We'll see what happens

339
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,319
So we end up getting into Alex's

340
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,879
Introductory piece

341
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Okay

342
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
It's Meandering is he going to do a race

343
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
Nobody

344
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
Kind of does a yak off B

345
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
Yakov Smirnoff

346
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
So yes

347
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
We're in digital media

348
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143

Realize I did

359

They abused

360
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Power of big

361
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855

00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
It didn't want you

367
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,887
Subway by country

368
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
I do like a bit of it

369
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Is bragging about his

370
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,311
Chris grade I thought it was about that wonderful weird

371
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
That is in opposition to the

372
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
Reality that's in front of him

373
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,111
He's drawn very miniscule crowd compared to the millions and millions of people with

374
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
Conservatively what is it

375
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
A tenth of the world's population was too much every world leader

376
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
Exact listen to everyday so that stuff

377
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
Yeah you can tell that it it's

378
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,399
Alex is not thrilled with

379
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,959
This turn out like you can see the self-consciousness

380
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
The fact that

381
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Billions

382
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Apple service

383
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
The fact that

384
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
In the middle of it

385
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
See traffic

386
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
Rainey Street

387
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Today's announcing

388
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
That one purse

389
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
4000

390
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Science

391
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Against the tyrants

392
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,440
That is a beautiful thing

393
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,256
That's a rationalization

394
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
Emma's nightclub Alex teases the theme

395
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Who's headlining speech

396
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,752
When I get back up here I've got a plan

397
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:38,176
Calls after this literally working

398
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
I think that you may be brilliantly deduced this might turn into an epic

399
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
At a certain point

400
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:56,864
Big headlines of something

401
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Hey workout

402
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,960
Not coming up in about 2 hours when I get my twin

403
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
I'm going to get it

404
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Smoking Gun

405
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
Governmental

406
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Funding

407
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Censorship

408
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
The American people

409
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
And the blueprint

410
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Now that's really

411
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
It happened

412
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
Right now

413
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
And we have a real

414
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Say no to this

415
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Again Alex is trying to get this sparse audience excited for his headlining

416
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Speech

417
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
It seems like a theme he's going for is basically the first

418
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
They came for poem

419
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,248
That was a poem written by the Lutheran Pastor Martin niemoller

420
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
In the form of the concession

421
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Expressing guilt

422
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
For not doing more

423
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
In the lead-up to

424
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
The Holocaust

425
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Because he thought it wasn't his

426
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Is problem

427
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
It's very clear that what Alex is doing is he's hoping

428
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Evoke that here

429
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,072
He will never ever ever

430
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Actually quote that poem

431
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,192
And that's because the first line is quote first they came for the Socialists

432
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
And I did not speak out because I was not a social

433
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,896
Alex wants to co-op the ever resonant themes of this poem bone ever talk about what the poem actually says because

434
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Kind of invested in the Enterprise of coming for the Socialist

435
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
The next stanza is about coming for the trade Union

436
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,928
Which again Alex would be on the side actively opposing the Union

437
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
The imagery in the

438
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,280
Feeling of that poem but not the specifics of it which is

439
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
Vine

440
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
The poem and the poet was

441
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,496
Dumb because Alex just summed up the whole pillow poem with just like

442
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,568
You know that if you don't stand up for somebody nobody to stand up for you

443
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Spell superlative he's a real poet

444
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Since being a poet

445
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
You can take classes

446
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
And poetry yes I have

447
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
And if you do

448
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
You'll get a great

449
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,112
A stroke that was a long walk

450
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:58,720
Okay in this next clip Alex starts rambling about giving Trump a grade

451
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
His performances present

452
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,632
Ill-advised these are not good things

453
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
To say about someone who your present is good

454
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
My main mission

455
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,336
President

456
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Very true

457
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Not good

458
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
If he doesn't think you

459
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
President-trump

460
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
The deal with you as a psychopath

461
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
And he believes

462
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
America

463
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Promoting archetype

464
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
A

465
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
-4

466
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Report card

467
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
This might not be the best way to characterize your hero president like I don't think anyone should be supporting an elected official

468
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,312
Transactional matters of public interest

469
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
I have no idea how Alex can get in front of this

470
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,712
In Crowd and tell them the Trump doesn't deal with you unless you have something to offer him

471
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Unexpected to sound good

472
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,576
It sounds insanely corrupt like blatant corruption

473
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,648
Even Alex is trying to make it sound good

474
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
It sounds like a mob guy Hey listen all of you 20 people here who totally have a ton of money

475
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
Trump is willing to deal with you if you get positive

476
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
Well-to-do crowd

477
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,568
Suss that out from the

478
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,432
The video Alex definition Trump does not have any interest

479
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
No probably not

480
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,296
So he gets an A minus

481
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Okay.

482
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,464
Minus report

483
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Because when it comes

484
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,792
Standing up

485
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Standing up

486
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Cartel

487
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Binding Force

488
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Ghungroo

489
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,032
And Veteran groups

490
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
Organization

491
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Pro-life groups

492
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
President-trump

493
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Standing up

494
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
I'm not sure how Alex is waiting grades

495
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,048
Here but I didn't realize that he put so little priority on Free Speech stuff

496
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Like you literally yells about it all the time

497
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Completely manufactured

498
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Complaints about the last have to do it

499
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Free Speech grievances

500
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
Like the purple penguin's affair

501
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Free Speech absolute

502
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
Like it's f***

503
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
Company is called Free Speech system

504
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,760
Based on every indication I get about what he pretends his positions are

505
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,832
If a president gets an F minus on Free Speech issues

506
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,184
It should be impossible for there to be a minus

507
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,744
10 amendments

508
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
Guess what

509
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:46,400
You f****** on one Amendment you still got a 90% Dan it looks perfect

510
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,496
Breeds of their system that follow certain rules

511
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,568
There's a method for averaging out great

512
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,616
Creating a grade point average

513
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:00,480
If you're taking college courses nueve's and three of them

514
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
That'll give you a Beat

515
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,296
Bridge or 3.0

516
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
8 - is a 3.7 GPA

517
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
And you need to be taking

518
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
14 classes before an s could be absorbed and leave you with an A- at Everett and that's only if all those

519
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
Those glasses are weighted exactly the same

520
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,752
Average grade is still a minus

521
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
This like so many other things is just Alex talkingshit

522
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
He doesn't really care about Free Speech because if he did it would

523
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Probably

524
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,992
Lisa think we're bumps Trump's grade down to Abbey okay

525
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,808
Okay let's do it this way let's go better than this way

526
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Alright

527
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Let's wait the averages here

528
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
Trump has two jobs

529
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,464
Important amendments

530
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
First

531
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
He's doing great on gun rights

532
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
So he has 92%

533
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
I'm not positive that's even the greatest

534
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Only look

535
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,008
Trump has indicated like

536
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Inclinations toward a red flag laws

537
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Alright

538
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
So maybe the guy who promises everything has delivered on fucholand is made himself a lot of money in the

539
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
Process that's why he's the greatest president

540
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,512
History of the world I think is just a strong indication that Alex realizes like

541
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Can't

542
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,424
They even B+ cuz that would take that as an insult my chances of getting his attention

543
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,776
Wow versus Howard

544
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
I told you

545
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Very weird Lizbeth

546
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,664
So Alex is spend a good portion of the his

547
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,736
Doctor reset talking about Julian Assange needs to be pardoned

548
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,600
Sure seems to be one of the only things that really enlivens the

549
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Krowd

550
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
President

551
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
Read Sign

552
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Metaphysical

553
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Candidate from

554
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Months before the alarm

555
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,096
Julian

556
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Sanjay

557
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
You have them released

558
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
And Julian Assange was

559
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Julian Assange

560
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,032
The trigger

561
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,824
And he

562
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Release

563
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
Criminal activities of the deep state

564
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,944
20 cars race Wars

565
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
And biowar

566
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
And coops

567
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,528
Pure Evil

568
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
But he did a hero's work

569
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
Instead of being carried

570
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Down

571
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Main Street in New York

572
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Sitting in a text

573
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Delivering

574
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,864
The shot down the Death Star reactor shaft

575
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Julian Assange

576
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Spent years

577
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
And years

578
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
And years

579
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
In solitary confinement

580
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Coryza

581
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Gibbering

582
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Person

583
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Hardly talk

584
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Seafaring

585
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
President-trump

586
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
What's there on the sidelines

587
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,064
God that sounds familiar

588
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Honorable

589
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Strength

590
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
If he doesn't

591
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Get Juliana

592
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Continue so long

593
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
With this fake-ass

594
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Extradition

595
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
President

596
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,984
Trump has joined all those cowardly globalist

597
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
In the swamp

598
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,288
And makes me

599
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Throw up

600
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Does that mean

601
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Support Hillary

602
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Getting ready to

603
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Hell no

604
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
But still

605
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
It takes a great

606
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
An absolute

607
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,584
So if you follow that he's saying Amazon to drop me to spiritual contract

608
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912
When Trump said release these females

609
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,544
Then Trump didn't follow through by pardoning Assange

610
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,104
Giving him clemency or whatever

611
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
The case would be

612
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,992
And so now Julian Assange is a gibbering a person who can't talk

613
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
And if Trump

614
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Doesn't

615
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Pardon Assange

616
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,880
That'll make Outlets want to throw up

617
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
But it'll still support him

618
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
I will it look

619
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,328
Okay so

620
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,192
Your rights by Line in the Sand but also I will still support you no matter what you do

621
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
I said

622
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:11,360
Yes that you couldn't sit in your hand and then smeared on my face that was my last drop but I swear to you if you do

623
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:15,456
That will be my starting over

624
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
You spew put it in my face again

625
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Support Hillary Clinton

626
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,560
Alright well she's still not running so you say anyone else starting podcast

627
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,656
Oh God I have no backbone

628
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
That seems to be the Republican Party

629
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
So Alex gets up

630
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
Petty grievance

631
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
A lot of like I've been wrong

632
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
This is an episode

633
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
When I've been wrong because it tells me that I'm on the right track

634
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,880
That mentality is going to be

635
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
Ubiquitous

636
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Speakers

637
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,560
Here is one of the first points were like this is not going

638
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
I mean when Alex gets up and just rants

639
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
He does all the times you said stupid things

640
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,520
Is exactly what you

641
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Things start to fall apart

642
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
I get down and

643
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,176
Intuit

644
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
That

645
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
The daggers of Truth

646
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Wonder there

647
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Chris Pine

648
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
In that place

649
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,392
Airfare

650
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
When they attacked me that I know

651
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,232
I've been given the guidance

652
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Strike

653
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
And so instead of being cowards

654
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Slave

655
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
We take action

656
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
Let's go ahead and bring up Tom Papa

657
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,216
National file

658
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Put on this Great America

659
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
I don't think the Tom pappert exactly when Alex was going to be wrapping up this little Randy intro because

660
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,832
Alex just you I was in the middle of yelling

661
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Then Alex just

662
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
Bales from the state

663
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,232
Not waiting for Tom to get up on stage and crucial.

664
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
A lot of open mic etiquette being broken here like if you're in trolling someone you wait onstage for them to come up you shake

665
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
Take their hand and ceremonially give them the stage

666
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,032
This seems like a little thing but it's an important gesture

667
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
Definitely subconsciously notices

668
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,432
Alex by virtue of being the biggest star in the building and most of the people there

669
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,480
Bossed as a position of authority

670
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:28,832
By leaving without greeting Tom onstage disrespect

671
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
Kind of like I've done my part good luck

672
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
It's very rude and it lends the whole show and air of disunity

673
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
Like the speakers are really in this together

674
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:44,448
If your goal is to have a successful performance their little things like this that you need to be mindful of and it just wild to think that Alex has been

675
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,240
In some form of show business or

676
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
And he doesn't

677
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Seem to know though

678
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Yeah absolutely

679
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
Space

680
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
Now another thing that happened

681
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,016
When you surprise somebody then just leave the stage is that you

682
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Completely sandbag

683
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,392
The audience's trying to applaud forensic performance is an introduction

684
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
So when

685
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,976
You know you wrap up as an intro the next person

686
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,024
But they take awhile to get on stage

687
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
The Applause will be clapped out by the time they get to the pony

688
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,680
Instead of being able to ride in on a wave of Applause and support

689
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,520
You're now faced with dying enthusiasm as you begin your presentation which

690
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Uphill battle

691
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,592
Instead of just getting going

692
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
You're now

693
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
Kind of in a position we have to win the crowd over

694
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,552
Which will see Tom tries to do with the you know here let's let's go ahead and listen to that here

695
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Little bit difficult to follow up on

696
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Alex is going to be

697
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Later tonight

698
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,192
Tfue you try and save it would be it's hard

699
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
The following

700
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
But that's a bad piece of business

701
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Unless you

702
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
Put something like a humorous

703
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,712
It's only going to Signal further week

704
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,296
And prove to the audience that you're not in control of the situation

705
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,904
But you act like you're giving the cop out for why I'm not going to be entertaining

706
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,768
It's hard to follow Alex it is it is fascinating how much of our

707
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Creating those

708
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
Little moments that will

709
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
Turn just an event into a f******

710
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
Show it to the illusion of an

711
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Actual show

712
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
Like those tiny little moments

713
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Can change Abby

714
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,360
Yeah and all of our

715
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,992
Very applicable to help poorly there do they don't understand

716
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,296
Tom pepper is f***

717
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
Before he even gets off

718
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
And part of it is specifically because

719
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,416
Alex is a selfish prick

720
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,768
Doesn't understand those little things about presentation and how to be

721
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,840
Magnanimous be assertive given

722
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
With the the space

723
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
It's it's a it's unfortunate because

724
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,056
I mean you could transform something from being like well good luck

725
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,872
To whoever comes up next to being like we're all in this

726
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
You know they're giving Coco

727
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Diesel fuel

728
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
People who have the talent and

729
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,808
Experience necessary to take that awful ending

730
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
Sacrifice their set

731
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,672
Turn into the host and then make the show a much better show

732
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Not that guy

733
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
No no no

734
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,376
And Alex doesn't do any favors as he

735
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
T.i. goes on

736
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
U.s.

737
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,288
New York time

738
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Everyday

739
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
That's right Alex

740
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Woohoo

741
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Can't talk to Alex

742
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Half a team

743
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:59,008
Ahmedabad situation when he introduced him and predictably Tom is not getting much juice going from the

744
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,664
But to be fair his role is mostly to be the guy from National files and plug website

745
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
I would pay for the event

746
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,016
He doesn't really need that much reaction

747
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Consider this

748
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,856
There's been three people on stage so far

749
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,392
I know three of them heading

750
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,440
Erie been introduced in the show as a hoe

751
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
Rob was there to Vamp in I guess

752
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
And then bring up Alec

753
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Alex is headlining

754
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,704
Can't even Alex Jones event without him showing up to say hello

755
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,568
And now pump a does they're doing the actual start of the speaker's block is the head of mission

756
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Mobile

757
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,456
If I'm in the audience this is already a disorienting level of disorganization from a production

758
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Standpoint

759
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Even if I didn't hate Alex

760
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
I would find this very unimpressive

761
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,136
It probably not think that this is going to be a show that has much of value

762
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,488
I don't know what's going on I don't know who's supposed to be the guide through the

763
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,328
Who's going to come up after the next speaker what's going on

764
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
Allegan a shotgun it I have loved Alex

765
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
20 years

766
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
And I have always imagined him to be competent

767
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,288
This is really bad

768
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:08,384
You can see Alex reinforce this feeling you have of

769
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,784
Dis truskin the capability the person onstage when he yells

770
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
I was trying to get through his speech

771
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,512
By Alex interrupting him he's subconsciously telling the audience that this guy on stage isn't worth listening

772
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
His value as a speaker is so low that you can just

773
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
Yell things out whenever you feel like it

774
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
It's very very disrespectful

775
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,544
They're claiming this event is about it's actually about Alex

776
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
What words do you want to hear

777
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,968
Yeah

778
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
So that's not great

779
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
But to be fair like I said Tom pepper

780
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,160
In terms of this show and what it is

781
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,464
He can stand to take a bullet

782
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
He's not

783
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:01,888
It's not going to be a make-or-break thing but it does give the the entire proceeding the appearance

784
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Just sloppy

785
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
He was going to do is

786
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,592
He's going to do the thing in like a barback room and now he's

787
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Suck it up

788
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:17,760
Alex gets to be the star of the show take constantly whenever Alex upstages you

789
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:23,904
Humiliates you too much fun

790
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
But it doesn't really look that bad

791
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,840
Exactly so he brings up the first Speaker official of the day

792
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,656
And the guy named Patrick Howley who works for

793
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,752
I'll do some self a comedian

794
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:56,928
Harvey Weinstein

795
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Can walk again

796
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,768
Oh hell yeah man

797
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:06,400
This reporter for National files coming out

798
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
The joke is a little muddy though

799
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,568
Because I think he's trying to poke fun at the idea that people like Hillary Clinton bring children's blood but

800
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,200
Also speaking at an event put on by Alex Jones definitely thinks people like Hillary drink children's blood

801
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,040
I'll talk about that quite a bit it's a central theme joke

802
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
Point is Muddy

803
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,416
Groans from the office

804
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,696
That somebody

805
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:34,560
Did put something in it

806
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608
That's not good

807
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
That's like going to Chicago open

808
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,472
Ever

809
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
That it is open my flight

810
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
Did you hear the news

811
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,456
I don't know what adrenochrome unseen is drinking but he can walk

812
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,760
Anyway this is Patrick Howley

813
00:40:54,016 --> 00:41:00,160
He's introduced as a writer for National file but mysteriously absent

814
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Daily Caller

815
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,024
When he founded the absurdly far-right blog Big League politics

816
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Is actually still the editor-in-chief

817
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,632
In February 2018 The Daily Beast

818
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Imported the big lie

819
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,472
Politics have been bought by a company called Mustard Seed Media

820
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,568
Which happens to be a political consultant named Riley O'Neal

821
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,920
Just finished up failing to get noted monster an alleged pedophile

822
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
I liked it in Alabama

823
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
So cool

824
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
Political consultant with great integrity

825
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,344
Clients is now Patrick haoles boss

826
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Great great

827
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,440
Also I should point out that the financial Arrangements

828
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,720
Is really shady

829
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,304
Considering the fact that the guy who owns Mustard Seed still in

830
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
Active political

831
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Consultant

832
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,192
He's being paid by candidates and politicians for covered on Big League politics

833
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Riley O'Neal

834
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Consulting firm called Tidewater strategy

835
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Along with another right-wing

836
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,592
Consultant

837
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
That Daily Beast article points out that most

838
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
Politicians who paid O'Neil in fridge

839
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
Recovery typically politic

840
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,623
Like a white nationalist Paul nehlen

841
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
And former Virginia gubernatorial candidate Corey Stewart

842
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
A pattern with these guys

843
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,071
I'll just read to you hear from the end of this daily be started

844
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
Politics is Antonio's first foray into the political news

845
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,799
And at least one other media property controls has promoted his Consulting firm's clients

846
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
First in Freedom daily North Carolina Central conservative news

847
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
Efforts by to O'Neill's clients

848
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,087
North State Leadership Council and North Carolina gun rights

849
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,903
Story promoting both of those groups were written

850
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,183
By Spencer hardest

851
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
Who works for Tidewater

852
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
Consulting Group

853
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,559
Hardison began contributing to Big League politics

854
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
This month

855
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
This is all super shady s*** and anyone in

856
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Interested at all

857
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,775
In any kind of journalistic Integrity would absolutely never

858
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Have their right-wing

859
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,127
Propaganda blog Beyond by active GOP political

860
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
Consultant yeah that's that's

861
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,711
Probably unethical

862
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503
How say that

863
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,879
Bi-level Albuquerque

864
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,671
But what frustrates me most is

865
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:12,511
She's apparently as some sort of syllabic meter requirements for his name

866
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
Mustard Seed Media

867
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
Big League politics and don't got the same

868
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,895
Beyond being a dumb dumb in a sellout I'm not particularly interested in Patrick Howley

869
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Is very boring

870
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:33,759
And that's funny as evidenced by

871
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
So we're not going to listen to anything more than half

872
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,647
Now when Panther gets done with his speech

873
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,951
He introduces the next speaker

874
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,743
Do their shotgun holsinger

875
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:49,887
Apparently they don't have any don't have another house, Patrick just bring Millie Weaver

876
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Speaking next

877
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,263
Who's got the chops and experience to really bring this whole thing together

878
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,591
Got it

879
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:04,991
So save the day talks about how Alex Jones woke her up

880
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
So how did I

881
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Get woken up

882
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
Who woke me up

883
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
This man sitting here in this room

884
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Alex Jones

885
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,863
Alex Jones is what

886
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Started

887
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Might reject

888
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
And everything

889
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Send

890
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
I have been working

891
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
Hard to

892
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,407
Millie Weaver speaking Next In Her speech

893
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,783
Start by talking about Democrats and Liberals are just dumb people who don't know the truth yet

894
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,343
She knows this firsthand because she used to be one

895
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,183
Jimenez you heard she gives Alex credit for waking her up and now she's smart

896
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,791
This is particularly funny because I'm old enough to remember when Billy Weaver tweeted Out quote

897
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,863
I think Facebook is a privately owned business

898
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,399
There's a thing called fact

899
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Checking Facebook

900
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Is a public business is publicly traded

901
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,311
Using that argument to justify Banning Alex Jones doesn't work

902
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
She got us

903
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:08,735
Nailed it has woken up to the smartest truth there is it's so awesome when these Dum Dums get so convinced there

904
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
Write about something that they shoot off some

905
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:15,135
Completely inaccurate thing while chastising people to fact-check

906
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
Kruger or like this little never get this

907
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
Like it bad

908
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:25,375
Really, Nan is it work here

909
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
And that is provided her with a lucrative Outlet where she could be marginally famous and there was absolutely no

910
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,567
Accountability required

911
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
That might feel like waking up

912
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Up to you but it's

913
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,407
It's called copper now

914
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,551
I steadfastly refuse to believe that to take anyone saying that Alex Jones

915
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
When it's just a normal everyday person saying it I think it sounds a little more reasonable because Alex can be persuasive in the

916
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,743
Simplicity

917
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Seductive

918
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,839
You can experience that is waking up but that's not really what it is

919
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,167
It's more just being indoctrinated into a bad thinking pattern

920
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
Cult leaders can

921
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,727
Makeup believe just mad at me

922
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:05,823
One of the reasons is that bad thinking pattern is satisfying

923
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,711
It's very easy and it feels good mostly because it allows you to imagine that all the other people in the world are blind

924
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Obvi

925
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,015
Reality that you've woken up to

926
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
And nothing is your fault

927
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
No ever

928
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
Its intellectual junk food

929
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,135
Just empty calories

930
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:25,535
For someone like Millie however when I hear her say that Alex woke her up there's absolutely zero chance that she isn't

931
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,303
S***

932
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
I just refuse to believe that anyone could work at Infowars a paying attention at all to what set on the network without realizing it out

933
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,239
I was just making up most of it

934
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
Basically nothing is real

935
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:42,175
Yeah the only way you can maintain respect for Alex working there is to have no principles to basically to be sleepwalking

936
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
Through life and not paying attention to anything he says

937
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,295
Which I would say is the opposite being woken up

938
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:52,671
Yeah that's that's like being put back to back to sleep like a little baby

939
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:58,559
Oh you don't have to worry about anything ever again just say it's the Liberals fault

940
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:05,471
The feel-good story for Millie to tell how she was a dumb liberal until the stupid texting yelled at her and showed her what reality really

941
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,751
It's like but it's b*******

942
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,287
It's just a factor

943
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,359
Manipulating people might be disaffected Liberals are in 2

944
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Pendants

945
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,967
You know it's kind of like a right-wing propaganda version of come on in the water's fine

946
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:21,855
That says reason why all of these right-wing grifters magically have some form of this backstory

947
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,159
Candace Owens Brandon straka

948
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,511
Of the Walk Away movement hashtag walk away they all have the same thing

949
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,047
Because it is

950
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
It's almost like giving permission to The Listener to like you can do it

951
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
Was a liberal

952
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,311
And then I was offered good money for no work

953
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
And now I'm not

954
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,151
And you two can do that

955
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
Little boy

956
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
So Milly

957
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,039
Assertive

958
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,623
Appreciative to Alex or like you're celebrating Alex a little bit

959
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
She gets into a story

960
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
The cheese I've heard her talk about before

961
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:02,815
I find no real talent

962
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
She was covering the Kentucky Governor torque tutorials race and she has a conspiracy about it that I've

963
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
Bring up a couple times and I don't find it

964
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,895
Compelling but it's interesting she says something while talking about the story in this

965
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
Speech

966
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
That she should be deeply ashamed of

967
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
I went forward I pushed it

968
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
I told everyone what was

969
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
What's going on

970
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
But some of that information

971
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
We couldn't release

972
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
Because in doing

973
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Lyngso

974
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
We would have been really

975
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
And

976
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
How many

977
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
Journalist Alto

978
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Sitting on information

979
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Love Tarot

980
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
But they can't

981
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
But those who were

982
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Brave like Julian

983
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Assange

984
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Those who

985
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Braids I mean

986
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
Even Chelsea Manning

987
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
I mean even

988
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Those people

989
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
That were Brave

990
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135
Hey what look what's happening

991
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
So like I said

992
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,719
I pray

993
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,743
Julian Assange

994
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
Great that she thinks Miss gendering is funny

995
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,167
Also if you listen carefully with Millie Weaver just did is saying to a hot mic that she's a

996
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
The coward

997
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
She's talking about some hot scoop that you had about Heather's election meddling in the Kentucky gubernatorial race incumbent

998
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
Matt Bevin loses

999
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
Bid for re-election

1000
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:26,271
There's no proof that this election was still a bit here milia saying that she has information that would prove

1001
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
You can't release

1002
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Because she's afraid of the consequences

1003
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,439
He's worried about what would happen to her personally if she revealed this information

1004
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,279
So she's keeping it to herself and allowing a fraudulent election to stand

1005
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,327
I don't believe her at all but

1006
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
If what you was saying we're true

1007
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,887
She's a piece of s***

1008
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,727
What happened to the Infowars model a model of being the tip of the spear

1009
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
What happened to the were the ones who hit the barbed wire talk

1010
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,639
Where's that Kamikaze mentality that Alex screams about all the time

1011
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:57,503
You dare call yourself an investigative journalist didn't claim that you've proved that an election was stolen

1012
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,831
You're not telling anyone what that proof is because you don't want the headache

1013
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
What can happen to you after work

1014
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Even the dramatized

1015
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
Imaginary version of herself familias

1016
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Should be ashamed

1017
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
Sometimes investigative journalism

1018
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,119
Means uncovering things that's a risk

1019
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Your comfort

1020
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
I'm just part of the gig

1021
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,519
Like imagine Upton Sinclair discovering what he did about the US Meat Packing in

1022
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,543
Industry

1023
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
What else could lead to trouble imma keep to myself I mean

1024
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
There something

1025
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,111
He showed up for the most part he's doing a great job as a perfect

1026
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:38,463
The word million all the Infowars people pretend to be

1027
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
Is one that requires hard work skill and a certainty of Khan

1028
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,423
A crisis Point could come at any time when you learn something the public needs to know

1029
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,727
But reviewing it could be bad to you personally

1030
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
If you pursue this kind of work

1031
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
You need to decide well ahead of time

1032
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
The Come What May

1033
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,359
You're serving the public

1034
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,151
Pinterest damn the torpedoes

1035
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
Millie's work shows that she doesn't have the skill nor does she put in the hard work

1036
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
The job requires

1037
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,831
A comments like that one that you had

1038
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
She doesn't have the Constitution

1039
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
M48 either

1040
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
This is embarrassing

1041
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,951
Even in her mythologized

1042
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,999
She's literally saying

1043
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,559
We should be

1044
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,911
Grateful and proud of the people who are brave like Julian Assange

1045
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
Do you like me

1046
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:27,103
I am very clearly a coward in comparison to Beretta to Julian Assange

1047
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
Peaches basically just I'm not cut out for this dude

1048
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,807
Bright and in the meantime I'm going to insult

1049
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Transit

1050
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
Hero

1051
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,415
A f****** true

1052
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,463
Goddamn hero

1053
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,047
But they're lying about who is doing the who did everything that they

1054
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,351
Pretend to have the principles necessary to do

1055
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:53,727
Yeah they should be shamed by Chelsea Manning

1056
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,591
Also Billy should probably feel weird about an advocate for Matt Bevin

1057
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,151
After he lost re-election you want a bit of a partner

1058
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:06,271
According to NPR quote in one case Bevin pardon to Man convicted of homicide

1059
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,415
That Man's family raised more than $20,000 at a political fundraiser to help Evan pay off a debt

1060
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
2015 gubernatorial

1061
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Yeah

1062
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,303
Another one of people Bevin park with a forty-one-year-old management

1063
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Convicted of raping a nine-year-old

1064
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,655
He pardoned another guy who killed his parents

1065
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Another was the guy you pardoned who is

1066
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,823
Convicted of beheading of female co-worker in hiding or butylated body in a barrel

1067
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
He also pardoned a woman who'd been convicted of attempt

1068
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,455
Hire a hitman to kill her child's father and his wife

1069
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,503
And to make it look like a murder-suicide

1070
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:43,391
Interesting leave that woman was a friend of Devon's sister testified her defense during the trial

1071
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,231
Overall he pardoned 428 people and mysteriously

1072
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
95% of them white

1073
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:55,935
Bevin's actions before leaving office were so shocking inoffensive that even noted morally dubious character Mitchum

1074
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
McConnell called it

1075
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
Matt Bevin is a disgusting piece of s***

1076
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
But use the candidate

1077
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
Trump was behind in that election

1078
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
To him losing must be proof

1079
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
Employee

1080
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,479
Hey look I'm not going to part look

1081
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,527
Apartment A lot of people not all good

1082
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,647
Not all you're going to get some bad apples in the

1083
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
I'm choosing to party

1084
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
List

1085
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,583
I'm sure Bevin pardon convicted murderer isn't pedophile

1086
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,655
This isn't a problem for an Intrepid reporter like Millie

1087
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
Assume plenty of them

1088
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
Hey

1089
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,263
Similarly

1090
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
Money go towards

1091
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,991
I'm not sure the only get specific case of that was that murderer I don't know is there more

1092
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,599
I think a number of the people that he did let out people and I just ended

1093
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,159
Dependent of all other contacts

1094
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Okay good

1095
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,047
You know some non-violent offenders

1096
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:04,031
In order to try and mask

1097
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
Cheese's

1098
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,151
20000 seems pretty cheap for a murder party

1099
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,551
Like while he added that he needed to pay and this got him out of that people doing this

1100
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
Just started raising money to I'm going Governor's to get a pardon for your loved ones or somebody not all of them are blatantly

1101
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,071
I'm not saying all of them are but I'm sure you could find a couple shirt

1102
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:32,447
We got blown out here you might still pardon somebody I saw his Twitter

1103
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:38,847
So Milly speech is pretty short and very embarrassing that she should do

1104
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:43,199
I really feel bad about it

1105
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,247
Things that she says understanding

1106
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,783
So now when she's done

1107
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
We could host

1108
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
But it's not Tom pepper

1109
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,439
It's probably due Rob Duke

1110
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,047
Millie Weaver is proof that

1111
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
Conservatives are way better looking

1112
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
Liberals that's not

1113
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
Call Idaho

1114
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
What

1115
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:09,567
Watch Billy's work grow and evolve throughout the many years one of them

1116
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
Great collaboration

1117
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,407
Was helping her

1118
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
Rainbow snatch

1119
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:15,967
Birthday

1120
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
If You Seen Her rainbow stats videos are off

1121
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Strange Bragg wow

1122
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,415
So now we know who to blame for that

1123
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,231
I don't understand how you can

1124
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Be a woman in

1125
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
Still be there

1126
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,071
Like just if you meant that

1127
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,399
Sing that they say

1128
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,703
The first thing is look at how good she look right

1129
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,287
If I were if I were producing comedy show and the house

1130
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,615
Said something like that about a female comic who is on the lineup

1131
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:50,015
I've never broke up again

1132
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,903
That might be really bad for everyone involved but I would be sure to never booked them

1133
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
Again that capacity special

1134
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,559
Inappropriate behavior

1135
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
Attractiveness or unattractiveness

1136
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
Has nothing to do with why you're here

1137
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
What she is bringing to the table

1138
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,263
Ostensible value as a

1139
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
The person

1140
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
To make it always

1141
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,383
Constantly about attractiveness and s*******

1142
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
Is a demeaning

1143
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
On a level

1144
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Buried

1145
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,807
It's an it you'll see more of it and they just keep it look

1146
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:25,343
I know you push it in my face

1147
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
For the 4th

1148
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,695
But I swear to God that is my Line in the Sand

1149
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
Enemy I think they like me

1150
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Interesting conversation

1151
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
I'm possibly about like

1152
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:39,423
It not bothering Millie and that's fine she has the right to not be bothered by it

1153
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
It's still just s*** Behavior

1154
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:46,079
So if you get another guest brings up another speaker

1155
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
Interesting

1156
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,663
Complained about the scammers on the right

1157
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:53,759
People like Ben Shapiro and Crowder and all them

1158
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Olivarez

1159
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Steamed

1160
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
Speakers

1161
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
During the Q&A

1162
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,375
Willie

1163
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
To work in pain

1164
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:31,135
Now I'm going to Grant the people like Steven Crowder Ben Shapiro Charlie Kirk way way more successful

1165
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:37,535
Their game with dunking on people on the street

1166
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
80% of Infowars field pieces are

1167
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:45,471
Like that number goes up to 90 if you're just talking about Owen Shroyer is work

1168
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:50,079
They haven't figured out how to edit the video to make

1169
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
Them look good

1170
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:56,991
See Ben Shapiro and those guys they edit the videos to make it look like they did do

1171
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
I think some of the Infowars ones

1172
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:04,671
Are successful in that just also think that maybe they're not as

1173
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:09,535
Good now we just seen too many anymore yelling

1174
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,887
More yelling base then Ben Shapiro's like Fast talking points

1175
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
Wingstop

1176
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,239
So this guy's name is Pete d'abrosca

1177
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,383
Trying to run for the US House in North Carolina

1178
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:31,039
The problem was the peat registered to vote as a republican in his address on December 3rd but he filed as a candidate to Q

1179
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Quickly thereafter

1180
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,719
North Carolina GOP as a rule that candidates are invalid if they file to run within 90 days of registering as a Republican

1181
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:45,119
Which is far as rules go makes total sense to me why would you want someone to stay

1182
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
I'll register on the day of the primary even though I'm a

1183
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Republican and I'll just do whatever I want

1184
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Of course

1185
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:57,919
Because Peter the kind of guy who'd show up at an Infowars rally he's decided that he's the victim in this whole thing

1186
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Challenges decision

1187
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,855
Honestly it's pathetic these guys can't just say I wasn't aware that rule and honestly I should have planned this out a little better

1188
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,647
Had everything in order I'll take that as a lesson

1189
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,439
I'll follow the rules next time

1190
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,999
It can't do that imagine one of these

1191
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
People just finally

1192
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,047
Please say

1193
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,375
My bad

1194
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:23,007
Every instance of them being incompetent as proof of a conspiracy to keep the real conservatives down or some s***

1195
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
It's such a week

1196
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,847
Cowardly posture particularly coming from the people

1197
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,383
Habitat lecturing people

1198
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Personal responsibility

1199
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,503
Jared Holz headline at rightwingwatch really sums it up perfectly

1200
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:38,367
Anti-immigrant bloggers dreams of Congress crushed by own incompetence

1201
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,719
Jared's article that leads

1202
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,255
In the appeal was quote

1203
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,327
What's the harm of putting mr. Roscoe on the ballot

1204
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:57,311
Your lawyer's best job is basically winking and saying come out

1205
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,175
His appeal was unanimously

1206
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:09,855
This guy Pete is a dumb dumb but he's a dumb dumb wants to end all immigration as a story about running for

1207
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,671
Congress that can be spun in a way as to make him look like a

1208
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
So he get to speak

1209
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
Those two things

1210
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Time to go hand

1211
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,119
It was about at this point in the rally when I was watching it. I started to get a little bit

1212
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Depressed

1213
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:27,775
The audience's problems for the mythology is alleged popularity

1214
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
Any speakers or just the worse

1215
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,407
And not in the sense that they're horrible people

1216
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
Apple speaker

1217
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,247
Patrick Howley was trying to be funny because with

1218
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,855
Millie Weaver is a monotone

1219
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,159
And now there's a whatever he's doing

1220
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:48,511
Cuz I went to the store and I got a six-pack at about this point

1221
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
F*** that really doesn't

1222
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Feel like anybody

1223
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,143
More than 20 minutes before they were about to go up

1224
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
You know what

1225
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,519
He did he had a long and I got a bunch of paper is ready

1226
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:05,663
I can listen to hours of Infowars b******* and even some other particularly unsavory s*** just keep moving

1227
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
There's such an air of sadness and

1228
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,015
Rodriguez free speech Summit

1229
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
It really bums me out there's the illusion

1230
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
When you're just listen

1231
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,415
Sing to the show that you're listening along with thousands

1232
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,999
But when you see that you're at a show

1233
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
Sparsely attended

1234
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,863
Even if you're online there was only 30 people around

1235
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
Is it's a lot sadder

1236
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:33,311
Yeah it's a lot Saturday

1237
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,687
I think when you watch the actual show

1238
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:45,087
Controlled environment in a lot of those production aspects of it can be handled much more easily

1239
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
So

1240
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Anyway

1241
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,999
Like I mentioned he's a player and he he

1242
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
No complaining about these right-wing people

1243
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,143
Going out dunking on college kids and random people on the street

1244
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
Not recognizing that the

1245
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,751
Essential pieces in Forest business model

1246
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,151
But you'll soon as super anti-immigrant and one of his argument seems to be that they don't share American values

1247
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:14,527
And he talks about he uses a statistic here that I think is a real teachable moment

1248
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
Berlin jail

1249
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,719
Replace

1250
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Not respecting

1251
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
I'm looking forward to the

1252
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,799
So this dude is like he's against illegal immigration he's also against

1253
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,639
Legal immigration

1254
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:46,271
So the pictures in the middle of the fundamental rights that Americans have are not valued by Emma Gray

1255
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,319
What he's doing is actually misusing

1256
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,087
Statistics

1257
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
There's no reason for him

1258
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:55,487
Statistics about hispanic attitudes

1259
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,839
Yes absolutely no way of knowing what proportion of the Hispanic people in that

1260
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,423
Study were born in the United States

1261
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,471
He's just conflating Hispanic whatever

1262
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
Rent which is kind of the point for people like him

1263
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:14,431
The conversation we're having appears to be about immigration with a very loud subtext is non-whites

1264
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:20,831
If Swedish people came over but that's not immigration they were born here probably or whatever

1265
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
62% number he's siding about Hispanics not respecting others rights

1266
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,071
A 2017 study published by the Cato in

1267
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,607
But the question was

1268
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
Do you respect others right

1269
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,239
Question is posed in the study was if people don't

1270
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,543
Respect others don't deserve the right of

1271
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Free speech

1272
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
That's not the same question

1273
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,919
I can understand how is your already posture

1274
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,247
Spanish people you're looking for ways to justify your

1275
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
You could get sloppy and choose the

1276
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
It doesn't work

1277
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:58,719
Also 36% of white people answer the question the same ways or wrestle with that couple with that one

1278
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,839
Probably from Sweden classic case of

1279
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,399
He can take the stat misrepresented used

1280
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:10,239
Hispanic

1281
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,031
He seems to not want to report

1282
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
In the same study 7

1283
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,127
7% of Hispanic people agreed that quote

1284
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,175
It would be difficult to ban hate speech

1285
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,479
Some people can't what hate speech is

1286
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Seems to indicate a Rattata

1287
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,063
Since to actually bam this stuff

1288
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
And this is with a

1289
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:25,855
He do in

1290
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,183
God Knows Why

1291
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
But they're throwing

1292
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,047
Includes I wanted to I could have some fun with that study

1293
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
I could tell you

1294
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,679
44% of Republicans and that studies the Holocaust denier shouldn't be allowed to

1295
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
To speak on college campus

1296
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
Oh no they're in trouble that

1297
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:48,383
Also I should point out that 47% of Republicans people who publicly criticize or disrespected

1298
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,943
Please China be allowed to speak at college campus

1299
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,503
So I guess you could draw the conclusion

1300
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,343
From that study Republicans prefer Holocaust

1301
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,023
It's cherry picking numbers and connecting them where they may not become

1302
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
I mean but also that does kind of

1303
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Sure

1304
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,823
I don't know if it's an appropriate use of the study to

1305
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
There's a lot of numbers in

1306
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
If you want to

1307
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,199
It's usually best to know what

1308
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,271
The questions are being asked that lead to the status though

1309
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Expecting that of this piece

1310
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
Guy seems like a big

1311
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Ask

1312
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,183
Man that's that's a heartening level of response from Republicans

1313
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,999
Considering they don't even know how many Holocaust deniers

1314
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Tigers that they support out of regular

1315
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:44,447
Let's get back to that 77% of people in the Hispanic Community. Wanting to ban free speaker

1316
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
You do hate speech cuz we can't

1317
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
Like what it is

1318
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,311
Zola

1319
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
What is Holocaust denial

1320
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
Not good

1321
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,271
So Alex seems to not be into this dude speech

1322
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
Sharky's talking about like

1323
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,135
Policy things

1324
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,159
Alex

1325
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,439
Cut them off

1326
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,999
Here with your policy

1327
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
You do not go

1328
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Stay

1329
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Abdominal

1330
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
2

1331
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
Almost

1332
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,319
I promise

1333
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
Peter Cetera

1334
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
And I love you

1335
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:45,119
BoBoiBoy the audiences laughing because Alex has walked up on stage

1336
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,935
Who is standing next to him ominously like

1337
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
You got to get off

1338
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:54,847
That is exactly how I used to run it over

1339
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,407
Now Alex is a host

1340
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
Naturally

1341
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Inchoate

1342
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,319
It's very it's very rough

1343
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:09,183
What kind of droning on was a little bit

1344
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,207
And so

1345
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,535
You know Pete was talking about how evil immigration is as a whole

1346
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,095
Alex takes that Steven starts screaming about it

1347
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
We love me

1348
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,911
India Mexico

1349
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
You're up wherever

1350
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,983
They're being used as a tool

1351
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
To destroy our American Republic

1352
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Do we have a right

1353
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,359
Water is a wonderful thing

1354
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
The pleasure town of Samantha

1355
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,015
And so we love our fellow humans we want to program future

1356
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,551
But he's right

1357
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,695
The globalist are using uncontrolled immigration as a weapon as a giant sucking sound

1358
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
What the late great

1359
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,071
Patriot from Texas Ross Perot said to lower our wages

1360
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:50,399
Can we see it as a weapon and we rushed Dexter

1361
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,847
Engaged

1362
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:04,223
Performative outrage that you can see like I'm turning it on

1363
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:09,087
I just got to snap this back into place

1364
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:16,511
He brings up another Harvey on the few days like I always had other we just had a real bad answer I'm going to

1365
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:20,351
Steve Harvey real quick and we'll get this back out of Santa

1366
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
So I was introduced as the next speaker in much like Rob could

1367
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,007
Come on stage and after Billy without saying

1368
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:30,079
She was hot Alex has the same

1369
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,359
Young lady

1370
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,175
Deanna Lorraine is amazing she's so smart

1371
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
Bubbly she's on fire

1372
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
He's running

1373
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Against

1374
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,647
Nancy Pelosi age

1375
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
Hi sexy lady too smart

1376
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
That's crazy

1377
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:58,751
The next speaker up is Deanna Lorraine who was recently a guest on Alex's shall we talked about her a little bit

1378
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:03,359
I'm not particularly interested in her since Barn divine intervention

1379
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,151
No idea who she is

1380
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:11,807
She's got this crowd excited cuz they're acting like she's running against Nancy Pelosi but she hasn't even won the GOP Primary yet

1381
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,159
She's not making that general elections is a classic counting chickens

1382
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
Situation

1383
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
Vaccine chip

1384
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
I'm noticing a bit of a trend

1385
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
This point what I'm watching it

1386
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:27,423
It seems like a number these speakers are actually just hopelessly lost congressional candidates

1387
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
Take whatever

1388
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:34,591
He doesn't even on the ballot and he was up there giving the stump speech by his policy platform

1389
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,895
And that Deanna Lorraine is here to campaign

1390
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,455
It's almost like a political sideshow

1391
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,039
Where are you know the people who aren't even serious enough to be at CPAC

1392
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,343
Or trying to pick up whatever scraps they can find

1393
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:49,439
That's a real bummer to be on the side show when the main show involved

1394
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
Carpe donktum and Rick

1395
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,535
From Pawn Stars

1396
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
I dumped him

1397
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,887
Was there he was

1398
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
Slideshow

1399
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,983
Probably

1400
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,055
So do you wanna has

1401
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,383
Stop that she pulled that you wants to brag about

1402
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,967
The computer chip out of a homeless guy

1403
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,807
Although that does happen at the end of this rally

1404
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Very sad

1405
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,487
So what I didn't respond to that

1406
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:28,095
The b**** move a excuse my language but we're allowed to have free speech

1407
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:31,167
And I flew a plane around San Francisco

1408
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,727
The Ted Pelosi for prison

1409
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
Because we need

1410
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,103
To have her accountable for her crimes against America

1411
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
And it is

1412
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
Thank you it's the most liberal District of America and people said oh no don't fly a plane around that says pillow

1413
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,063
Pelosi for prison

1414
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,855
That's not something you should do

1415
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:54,207
So Deanna is assertive here that San Francisco's most liberal District in the United States

1416
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,511
First of all San Francisco is not a district

1417
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,559
He's talking about California's 12th

1418
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,399
Congressional district which doesn't actually even contain all of San Francisco

1419
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,935
Sum of 7

1420
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,215
Cisco's in the 14th

1421
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
Also

1422
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
California's 12th is not the most liberal District in country

1423
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:14,943
This measurement is captured by the cook political report partisan voter index

1424
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
Or the pvi

1425
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:22,111
Send it started in 1997 the PPI is considered one of the most solid Tools in terms of understanding

1426
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,695
Partisan leanings broken-down on a granular level in everything

1427
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Congressional

1428
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:33,119
California's 12th District has a Democrat + 37 pvi which is a strong leading Democrat

1429
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
For sure

1430
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
There's no arguing

1431
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
However

1432
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:40,031
You don't have to look very far to find a stronger leading District because

1433
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,847
California's 13th of the PPI of democrat

1434
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
+ 40

1435
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:49,247
The District of Columbia and Democrat + 43 Illinois 7th as Democrat + 38

1436
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,527
New York's 5th is

1437
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,319
+ 37/7

1438
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,343
Is + 38

1439
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
The 13th is + 43

1440
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,719
Pennsylvania 2nd District is Democrat + 40

1441
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,023
Annie actually the most liberal District

1442
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Country is New York's 50

1443
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Coming in at + 44

1444
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,935
I know that is not where Alexandria ocasio-cortez got elected

1445
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,959
She's from the 14

1446
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
District

1447
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
Which is only Democrat + 29

1448
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,591
San Francisco isn't the most liberal disc

1449
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,127
Certain country but it feels like

1450
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
Get to these sort of hardcore

1451
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
Conservatives

1452
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:21,503
Because the city and the surrounding area played such an important role in

1453
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
The activism in the 60s

1454
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,391
Just lingers to this day to make San Francisco cultural villain

1455
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,415
Conservatives

1456
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,231
Feels like the most liberal District but it's not

1457
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:36,351
Honestly this feels more like Deanna giving herself excuses for why she's inevitably

1458
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
The selection

1459
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:40,447
Hopefully not the GOP Primary though

1460
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,311
Trouble I would assume the people were advising enough to rent out a plane

1461
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
Bob because the disc

1462
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
Too liberal. Because her candidacy is

1463
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
The farce and it seems like

1464
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
I mean not just that

1465
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,039
Come up with an original

1466
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:55,807
My dear lady

1467
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,511
Hey man

1468
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,071
Here's the thing all you liberals go to

1469
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Prison

1470
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
Here's the thing

1471
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
You father playing around

1472
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,471
Indiana

1473
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:19,103
I don't believe this is real

1474
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,919
Honest I hope this is okay but I'm going to play a little

1475
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,967
22nd voicemail from someone

1476
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,807
That that song by Pelosi for prison Banner in the air in Sanford

1477
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,343
I'm going to play a quick

1478
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Clap

1479
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,159
Why don't you call and it's already

1480
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
Adopt a pet

1481
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Make It Rain

1482
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
Make your rapist America

1483
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,391
These are the people that were up against you guys there we are at War

1484
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,927
And we need to fight

1485
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
We need to fight these are the real fascist

1486
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:12,607
I don't believe for a second that that's a real voicemail that some of us are playing the f*** out

1487
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,887
A couple reasons why

1488
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,543
The first is it that voicemail started with the guy saying I got your text message seems weird

1489
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:24,639
About how did you see did you see the plane that I flew

1490
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:30,783
Why is Deanna texting with the guys allegedly leaving a random voicemail everything her Pelosi plane

1491
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,087
Second the idea that someone who doesn't like

1492
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,903
Lucy playing call Iran

1493
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
The death camps

1494
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,719
Because that's where we're going that's absurd

1495
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,279
The first problem is with his is it

1496
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,607
That's primarily an obsession of the right

1497
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
People like Alex Indiana

1498
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:51,263
Alex has been yelling about FEMA camps being right around the corner for over a decade and then that time of

1499
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:57,663
Never heard any of his enemies really suggest that they were interested in putting people in Canada

1500
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:02,783
The angry Democrat can't because you're conservative is a conservative Boogeyman

1501
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,807
Not a real thing

1502
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,879
But more importantly she's f****** up the whole game

1503
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,487
The death camps in shade or supposed to be being pushed by people who were super fart

1504
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,023
The Socialist and communist

1505
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
That's where the future narrative is supposed to live

1506
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,655
The people who are supposed to want to make those

1507
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,007
Camps are also the people in the left who don't really like Nancy Pelosi

1508
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,847
The idea that you're going to offend a leftist by bashing Pelosi

1509
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Laughable

1510
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,199
They may vote for her overweening like DNR

1511
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:40,927
I've literally zero. The Deanna had some record that for so she could play it and show how much airplane is pissing off the den

1512
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
That's the only currency these idiot app

1513
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,095
The notion that their ideas and actions of value because they make their political opposition angry

1514
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,143
It's honestly super sad yeah

1515
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,959
Also I saw a picture of the banner that you flew

1516
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
And it doesn't have a phone number on

1517
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
Entertainment

1518
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,343
A shity photoshopped like it's a banner flying behind an airplane that has

1519
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:15,743
Perfectly right angles on it it's directed exactly the camera has no Shadows are wrinkles or anything

1520
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
It's very very sad

1521
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,839
Deanna posted a picture of the banner with a captcha

1522
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,655
It's raining liberal tears in San Francisco right now

1523
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,727
Another words for how lame

1524
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,615
See pictures elsewhere of the banner

1525
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:36,991
It's like folded over itself like as any battery care

1526
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:42,879
Saw that it was like that doesn't look good on my on my website I'm going to take a picture that says

1527
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,951
Leave for son

1528
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,023
Looks

1529
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Look desperate

1530
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Chicago

1531
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Very sad

1532
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,375
Listen to voicemail

1533
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,423
To that is not somebody who's angry

1534
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,287
Okay and

1535
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
You are a

1536
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,407
And so we are going to keep going on that you're a fat

1537
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,967
Defcamp check that box

1538
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,735
Do deaf

1539
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
Camp alright

1540
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:14,111
You're a bad person anyways see you at brunch tomorrow bye

1541
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:18,975
Done are we get another speaker that Alex has now taken over as just a host

1542
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
I guess because he comes up

1543
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,839
You bet

1544
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
But hey

1545
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
We're here

1546
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Enrique

1547
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:31,519
Get up here and kick their ass

1548
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,919
And with four drinks in here

1549
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:42,015
Available this guy right now

1550
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,855
Yeah it should be part of that Alex is clearly pretty drunk

1551
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,927
It gets worse later

1552
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,487
Where is really showing

1553
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,815
The proud boys

1554
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,351
Be mine real

1555
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,935
At what sort of secret missions Alex's refer him to the eggplant with them

1556
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,775
It could either be not masturbating naming a bunch of cereals

1557
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:09,151
Elaborate plots to Spring Rodger Stone from prison

1558
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:15,807
Or they could just terrorizing on white person but beyond that tario is another hopelessly doomed aspiring

1559
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
Congressional candidate

1560
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:23,487
He's running for housing Florida and there's no chance in hell he's winning and I doubt he's even going to win the

1561
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,279
As we know without Stone

1562
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
In Florida you got no chance

1563
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:31,423
This event for all this pretence of being a free speech Summit really just

1564
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,727
Feels like a rally for xenophobic

1565
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:38,079
Extreme right-wing actually candidates

1566
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
Hey KK

1567
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Promise for nothing

1568
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,199
Time is Grimm

1569
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:48,831
Still not full and the more exotic congressional candidates they have coming

1570
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,111
Good morning feels like

1571
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,183
Desperately trying to assert their relevance to a bunch of empty chairs

1572
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,719
I don't know how else to put it

1573
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
This is a bummer

1574
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:56,511
Not because

1575
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
That kind of evil

1576
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,071
Seattle

1577
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:03,679
Trump's rallies are a bummer cuz they're scared

1578
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,215
Sad sad sad

1579
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,751
Sad world dies

1580
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Definitely

1581
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
I think it's

1582
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
They have to be

1583
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:13,663
Like it has to start Dawning on these right-wing grifters

1584
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
That they got pushed out

1585
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,223
By their own grift

1586
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,503
You know like

1587
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:24,159
C-pack used to be for normal people and then pay got their own big place where they got to be conspiracy crazy

1588
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,487
Enough sebak is the conspiracy crazy they're stealing their

1589
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,511
Conspiracy crazy

1590
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:33,375
So they're going well

1591
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,935
Of like what is okay

1592
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:41,567
The grifter crazy

1593
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:48,223
We might use you if we need right right we are never going to let you at the table like James

1594
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,039
Pokefan Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk

1595
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
Car speakers

1596
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,647
Headlining future speakers at CPAC

1597
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,695
These people are in a quarter

1598
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,719
Purple Ballroom

1599
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,255
But they had to rent out themselves

1600
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
And they're sad

1601
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,839
Yeah I feel like this is like

1602
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Walmart

1603
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:10,495
Moved in on the conspiracy grifter and pushed all these mom-and-pop conspiracy grifters into the knot

1604
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Territory

1605
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
Hey I mean look

1606
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:15,872
That's a little bit of a simple analogy but there might be something behind

1607
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,968
We are brave

1608
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,528
Interesting thought

1609
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
Enrique starts bragging

1610
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
About all the things that he's banned from

1611
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,744
Which seems to be a theme like some of these people were actually kicked off a bunch of stuff

1612
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,840
Like it seems like they're really into talking about how many things are banned from

1613
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,632
Cuz that gives them some kind of a capon

1614
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,728
Just a couple miles away from here on band on

1615
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
I'm going to see

1616
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Seabeck

1617
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
Can't go in there

1618
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,360
I'm banned off of

1619
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Here we go I got a list

1620
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
I should have the

1621
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,456
Scroll through it

1622
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,784
So I've been banned off Facebook

1623
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832

01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,400
Alex I can't keep going with my wrist yesterday

1628
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
Alex is

1629
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,240
Pretty drop

1630
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
Entrapment

1631
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,920
No I think I think

1632
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,480
Reception from the audience

1633
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,552
It's catch-as-catch-can

1634
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
But

1635
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:34,720
Henrico it is important poorly received as let's say that first guy with the bad comedy

1636
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,512
Dabrowska with his boring ass

1637
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,840
Good xenophobic policy my papers

1638
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:44,448
Enrique is doing okay that that is one of those situations

1639
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,472
Drunk

1640
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
Voorhees

1641
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Trying to help

1642
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,848
From the yard as opposed to disrupt

1643
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,128
Yeah

1644
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688
Bell Alex

1645
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Alex gets up

1646
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,040

1647
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,576
He's problem drunk

1648
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
The last stages of gulag

1649
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,208
And they're doing that to Rodger Stone right now

1650
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,144
It's not about silencing us it's not about taking our finances it's about putting us in jail they want us long and they

1651
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
One is dead

1652
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Lowe's

1653
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,800
Amen to that

1654
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Ziffy

1655
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,296
So now we're at the point where they're screaming about

1656
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:35,136
The town is really naked a like

1657
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,160
We're also

1658
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
20 Kellogg's

1659
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,840
Not only is the message they want to put us in a gulag and they want to kill us

1660
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,888
You can't trust the people in this room

1661
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,912
Evil

1662
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,192
Wants to go ahead

1663
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:54,592
And take over this country we call it socialism we call it communism is Satanism it's evil sure

1664
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,616
It is here

1665
01:22:56,128 --> 01:23:00,224
What we do here loved it probably in this room

1666
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,552
How many somebody infiltrated in here

1667
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:08,416
We have today just enjoy your goddamn rally

1668
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,792

01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:18,144
Slowly reveal who did the cry

1670
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:25,056
Where can I find the FBI murder mystery Mouse

1671
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,920
Alex Joseph

1672
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,504
NFL start running from route

1673
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:40,416
Perfect

1674
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,280
Has all the potential of equate you don't need to

1675
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,584
Gas stations

1676
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
Computer

1677
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,216
So he gets done with his paranoid

1678
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:57,824
Speech Alex comes up to introduce the next speaker and

1679
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
He is

1680
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,176
7

1681
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,224
I'll tell you what they fear

1682
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,016
The past already been laid out

1683
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,344
Worldwide

1684
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,624
And we're going today

1685
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,232
And the worse things get the more people are going understand it

1686
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:16,768
Mariah

1687
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,840
Lee Stranahan is investigative journalist

1688
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,864
He's works

1689
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
For all the big leftist Publications

1690
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
The route 3

1691
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
Breitbart

1692
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,032
He's worked for them all

1693
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,432
Solely Stranahan's the next speaker and finally we have someone who's not running a Congressional Campaign

1694
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:39,040
He speaks mostly be about the Ukraine whistleblower

1695
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:42,112
The crowd to keep changing his supposed name

1696
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,904
I tried to follow a

1697
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
And his speech

1698
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,488
But I also found myself not very

1699
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:53,120
It seems like it's Point may have been to be wary of the CIA and if that's what he's getting at

1700
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Good for you

1701
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:54,912
Sure

1702
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
Maryville

1703
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,984
Something here

1704
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Who got a note

1705
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,592
Alex's problematically drunk now

1706
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,408
Have you called Breitbart a leftist publication

1707
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,016
Yeah

1708
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
This is where I started to get worried

1709
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
And the vibe started the trans

1710
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:19,232
This event is really bad

1711
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,536
All right how far is it

1712
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
What

1713
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
How far into the events are we

1714
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
Maybe an hour

1715
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,544
I don't know how long it's supposed to go but it ends up going 3 hours

1716
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Alright

1717
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Alright

1718
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,384
So

1719
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,176
He's giving his speech

1720
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,200
And it's

1721
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Really just

1722
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:45,600
Along the lines like I said he keeps getting the crowd to chant the whistleblowers name

1723
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,648
And it's not a very long speech

1724
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,720
But he gets interrupted by Rob do

1725
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,536
In the middle of it Mike down for this because

1726
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,072
Where Alex takes this

1727
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
Is

1728
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
Japan for the

1729
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,104
Words really really all Eric ciaramella

1730
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,968
Panama band on video and that's where we're going to put this up

1731
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:17,344
Later tonight the system and if there's

1732
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:24,000
The judge in the stone show trial says don't send the name of the jerseys under federal laws will be probably

1733
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:30,400
Because the Democratic party operatives and they're panicking right now and we put out the names of the jury

1734
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:37,056
And now he's burning in hell

1735
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,408
Because her threats

1736
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,944
We're cold

1737
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
We called them

1738
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
And no

1739
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,672
That Amy Berman Jackson Burns in hell

1740
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,072
Loser say this is a speaker

1741
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
It is hard to follow Alex Jones

1742
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,448
Alright I understand that I was pretty drunk by this point

1743
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:10,336
Completely lost his ability to control himself but if I had known it was going on

1744
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:16,736
I would think this was a man celebrating after murdering address

1745
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:22,880
People don't typically help others still alive

1746
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,720
Also Rob do is the saddest little boy here scampering up to the mic

1747
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:31,584
Audience excited about how dangerous it is to say this whistleblowers name

1748
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,656
The f****** out there man

1749
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:35,936
They are not f***

1750
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,472
Checking out there they are effing

1751
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,104
Let's recall that he specifically did not use the word f*** it better not be speech

1752
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,200
It's such a fetishization is manufactured in Imagine persecution

1753
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
Yeah like this is

1754
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,016
The end result of Alex's

1755
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:53,600
Horribly misguided philosophy that you know that you're right when you're getting

1756
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,928
Attacked would you even expressed at the beginning of his speech

1757
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,208
You check at the at the start

1758
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
If you internalize that believe

1759
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,792
Then you'll interpret attacks

1760
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
It's being proof

1761
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,328
But you're right

1762
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:06,400
What gives you the validation and a bit of a dopamine Rush

1763
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,424
We're doing it

1764
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:13,568
What happens when you're not getting attacked and you're very sad. It is just happening and no one cares

1765
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
Well then

1766
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,920
You might just need to interrupt Lee Stranahan to pretend

1767
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,688
You just

1768
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,016
Might get attacked at some point we could then prove that you're right

1769
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,576
And give you the validation you so desperately crave

1770
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:31,488
Tying your value to how negatively people respond to you is a very sad game and it runs so consistently through these people

1771
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,048
Rob's introjection here to Deanna's

1772
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,352
Clearly fake voicemail there like

1773
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,912
Needing that Rush

1774
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,728
Turn the oppositional Defiance disorder into

1775
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,080
So Alex's maybe killed Amy Berman Jackson

1776
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
Sandwiches

1777
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:49,408
Top news

1778
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,200
I have not checked on her recent

1779
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:57,856
So weird that is a weird thing to say at least you see there the cop out of it's hard to fight

1780
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:02,208
Fallout

1781
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:06,560
The trend Alex interrupt their like how

1782
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:12,960
It's surrender in general cuz he has a resume

1783
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,032
He's an actual report

1784
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
He cares too much about this and keeps us

1785
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Speed short

1786
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
He's prepared

1787
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,920
And so he can

1788
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,712
Deflected

1789
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,248
But still that

1790
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:28,576
Alex interrupting and yelling about 80 bourbon

1791
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:32,416
It is only responsible how do you follow Alex

1792
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,208
He's out there

1793
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Yay so he finishes up his speech

1794
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
Alex is still being the house

1795
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
And he seems to have forgotten

1796
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,632
Who's coming up now

1797
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
I got my nuts

1798
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
Alright

1799
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,408
We're having a good night tonight to 5:30 and it's amazing

1800
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:57,248
Thanks, 911 let's go ahead and bring up

1801
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,040
Amorality

1802
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,576
NSA

1803
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,624
We got to show Bill Benny

1804
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,440
You wanted to, couldn't, is working on a project

1805
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,768
They should have Tommy Collins my partner on

1806
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
He's working with me

1807
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
On major

1808
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Operation

1809
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,912
So I've never met Tommy Collins but I'm excited too

1810
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,936
Have them on

1811
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
So Tommy come on up here

1812
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
Thank you so much

1813
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
This show needs a producer's touch

1814
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,848
Because it's sloppy

1815
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,944
I know that Alex is drunk and he's a force of nature so no amount of production

1816
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,760
Is really going to help with that little things

1817
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,832
In terms of making this not seem like a ridiculous

1818
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
Amateurs

1819
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
Spectacle

1820
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,952
The one you could have had the speakers list up there like

1821
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,976
Taped to the podium

1822
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:42,816
Accidentally forget IT Crowd to grab it

1823
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
Because he has no idea who's coming up next

1824
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,424
Another thing that might have been good having

1825
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,752
How to beat the people he's going to introduce introduce

1826
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
Alex lagina

1827
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:58,432
Emily has no idea of Tommy is a man or a woman and yet here he is presented with an expert because William Benny didn't want to show up

1828
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,760
Tommy Collins runs a group called America restore

1829
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,600
I admit that I don't know what that was all about but I do check out their face

1830
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,648
What's that

1831
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:14,048
Look at that another person crazy

1832
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
On February 26th 2020

1833
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:23,520
2020 America restored posted a link to an article with the headline

1834
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,312
Promises to terminate program

1835
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
This was such a blade

1836
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:32,992
These are b******* from some dumb blog do they use the picture of the NBC News logo on it imply credibility

1837
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:37,600
It is so flagrant that even the commenters had to point out that this was a fake story

1838
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,392
As of February 29th

1839
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,464
This post is still up on their page

1840
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
I don't know

1841
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,024
Brother about page

1842
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,816
Christian

1843
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:52,448
List Outlet pushing for what you might describe as either Christian LED Nation or theocracy depending on your point of view

1844
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,496
I don't really care too much about this stuff

1845
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:58,080
Because honestly I looked at it and I think from some of the metrics

1846
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,384
Pretty clear that a lot of the members of

1847
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
A group of bots

1848
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:06,784
Anyway I guess that maybe Tommy works as William Benny on some stuff which is

1849
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,808
Completely nuts

1850
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:14,208
Supposed to be the former technical

1851
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,232
Fake things on Facebook

1852
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,512
Well she has a part-time job

1853
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,304
What a tag team

1854
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
So

1855
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
Tommy gets up

1856
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
And

1857
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,728
Cheat Her speech is obviously about William Binney

1858
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
That's all

1859
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,336
And I would say if you listen carefully

1860
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,616
I don't think she

1861
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
Has a handle on the

1862
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
Details

1863
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,200
Of the things that bill does

1864
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:41,856
Bill if you guys don't know who he is Bill Binney and on most people do but I'll give you a little run-down Bilby

1865
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,928
Is the man that's responsible for building out about

1866
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,488
Two-thirds of the modern-day NSA

1867
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
And he left in the

1868
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:54,400
Don't you know early 2000's and when he left there

1869
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,192
They're still using

1870
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:04,640
I shouldn't say I'm here I either he they're still use heat they're still using the stuff that he had originally

1871
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,664
Developed

1872
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
Powerful

1873
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,528
Bill has been continuing to work on things

1874
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,088
I hit stuff with so Innovative at that time

1875
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,136
They've never been able to get better

1876
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,768
So that's that's green how or who made some stuff

1877
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,840
It's really powerful

1878
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:26,912
You make stuff that's really good stuff these things

1879
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Powerful

1880
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,544
Sometimes I'll be working on some things and I'll think this is a good stuff

1881
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,128
Man I just don't know how to

1882
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,688
You wrote a better sweet most everybody there

1883
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,040
What are you talkin about

1884
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:48,160
The national stuff agency

1885
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:52,256
Honestly kind of wonder if she's even there at the request of William

1886
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:55,840
Most of her speech is pushing the conspiracy that the guccifer hack

1887
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,888
Couldn't have been done remotely over

1888
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
The internet

1889
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:01,728
Would you the position that William Benny has definitely advance

1890
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,288
We also recanted it in 2018

1891
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:08,640
When Duncan Campbell demonstrated to him arrive abeka

1892
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,176
Conclusion manipulate

1893
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:15,552
I honestly have no idea what's going on here but I don't exclude the possibility that William Benny has nothing

1894
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,344
To do with her speech in the present day

1895
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,464
The only connection between Tommy and Benny that I can find online is from 2018

1896
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,256
An interview that she did with him

1897
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,280
Prior to

1898
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,072
To the point where Benny walk back the gusev

1899
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Yeah

1900
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,632
I have no idea what's going on here

1901
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,192
I'd like this is booking that I would have avoided

1902
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,472
If I were Infowars

1903
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,776
It raises more questions than answers

1904
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,568
Provides

1905
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,336
Amateurish

1906
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,128
This lineup is already overbooked

1907
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:45,248
There's no need for this this is not bring anything to the table

1908
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,296
I told today was a good day

1909
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
So

1910
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,648
The reason

1911
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
Bedtime

1912
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,952
She's there

1913
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,488
And read what you got on

1914
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,512
Stage honest

1915
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,328
Is that she promised information

1916
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
In-N-Out

1917
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:02,400
Big Bill Bennington working on

1918
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,448
So they think they're going to break some big news

1919
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,752
Right and that apparently the bills been working

1920
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
Turn on thing

1921
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,592
And she gets into it here in this

1922
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
That's what builds stuff did it pick needles out of haystack it was proven that bill would have asked

1923
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,344
Actually discovered 9/11 before it happened bills

1924
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,136
Forte is bald

1925
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,440
Data his Forte

1926
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,000
Meaning of forte unparalleled

1927
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:33,888
Nothing out there like it it's never been reinvented the NSA is enough to get better

1928
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:39,008
Bill's the bomb he has technology that's never been recreated

1929
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
Great

1930
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,360
Until now

1931
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,688
You guys

1932
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
No right now

1933
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:51,808
Go up to this date has never ever even ask for money for a spa

1934
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:58,208
Speaking engagements never wanted anyone to ever accuse him

1935
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,816
Yeah you never worked up she never got money on the movie nothing

1936
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,376
You don't want to listen to this you guys

1937
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:09,216
I told that's my bills on board with a non-for-profit

1938
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:15,616
Because this is what we're going to do we're going to build out bills technology right now and we need every freedom-loving America

1939
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,920
Can to get on board

1940
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:24,576
Even I was caught a little bit off guard when it's turned into a situation where Tommy is asking for money to make this super powerful technology to belies

1941
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:30,976
Stop 911

1942
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
About this

1943
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
What you don't need bills tattoo I predicted 9/11

1944
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,912
Considering almost all of Alex's credibility is based on employment to have done just that

1945
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:41,728
Play some money

1946
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
Second

1947
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,312
Do you work for the NSA online license

1948
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,112
Hired in October 2001

1949
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,184
Suspiciously basically

1950
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,744
I can't imagine that a roomful of likes

1951
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,632
60 people are going to raise funds to provide some kind of Miracle technology

1952
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:15,776
Considering he was literally at the NSA in a position to use all of his genius at the time when the worst terrorist attack on us soil

1953
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:20,896
No heat what you're missing is he actually created

1954
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,736
Mark Wahlberg who would have stopped 9/11

1955
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
If he was there

1956
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,296
Who's all goddamn Hustle

1957
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,856
And it said on the one hand on the other hand

1958
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:36,256
I got a pretty big charge at a little response Tommy got after yelling until now she really thought there was going to

1959
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,864
Harry Potter

1960
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:45,216
I was very funny I felt that pain entirely

1961
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:51,104
You know granted in those situations are trying to get a laugh not raise funds for an imaginary Splinter Hi-Tech

1962
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,128
Intelligence operation

1963
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:57,248
Field crypto-fascist

1964
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,064
I can't imagine the feeling

1965
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,696
If I say something wrong

1966
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:10,048
Are they going to kill me somebody

1967
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:13,376
Is get out you just get rushed off stage cuz once it becomes clear

1968
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:16,192
She's trying to raise money

1969
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,312
He still needs him as a expert on

1970
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
Non-Stop

1971
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,128
And so Alex

1972
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,664
Japanese

1973
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,432
Boo

1974
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,968
No backstory

1975
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,016
Admittedly in US history

1976
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
George Washington was great because

1977
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,112
William Benny is like a

1978
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,928
Savon George Washington

1979
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
The whole modern essay

1980
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,792
Anyone who expose the corruption

1981
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,072
They went after a man

1982
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:44,096
And try to Kelly

1983
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,144
Is make a big deal about it they poisoning

1984
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,168
Did the Senate

1985
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,984
I'll on Cherry lost his legs

1986
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
He's a real patreon

1987
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,568
Loses legs cuz it was poison

1988
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,592
He has diabetes

1989
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:00,224
They could play Poison them with sugar Dan

1990
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
Alex technology and I think this clip is actually like a really

1991
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:13,536
Amazing little demonstration of Alex not what he's about to say when he starts a sentence

1992
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,608
You gotta follow this track

1993
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,656
That's what people have gone through to bring you

1994
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,192
Just level information

1995
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,008
We're talkin about

1996
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,056
3D imaging

1997
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:26,848
Digital quana

1998
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,128
Computing mapping

1999
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
And

2000
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,688
Literally being able to

2001
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,968
Judge pre-crime

2002
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:34,272
The system didn't want to use that

2003
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,552
I'm not even sure I'm for that

2004
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
But

2005
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,624
They wanted it all.

2006
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,672
Continue they use the computers.

2007
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Continue the crime

2008
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,512
And the continued the criminality

2009
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:50,912
So you see what happened there is that Alex got caught up and rambling about how Bill Binney at this amazing technology created at the globe

2010
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,448
Wanted to use

2011
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:55,264
Is 3D imaging and all that so sophisticated

2012
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,288
Detect crimes

2013
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,056
Before they happen

2014
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:01,408
As Alex is talking he realizes that he's describing something he categorically

2015
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Has to be opposed to

2016
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,248
Is archetypical dystopian fiction stuff

2017
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,552
It is literally the government

2018
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,856
Watching you all the time

2019
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,256
So he expresses that he be in favor of it and then does a little sleight of hand completely flips old story

2020
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:22,656
That's why they tried to continue it and he's even though but that's only because he was going to stop 911

2021
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
He had to retire

2022
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,056
As soon as he realizes that he needs to be against this Minority Report Technologies pretending Benny made

2023
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
He knows

2024
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,640
The globalists now have to be in favor of it

2025
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,664
Reproduction

2026
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,992
As if he didn't save they were trying to stop Benny like 10 seconds

2027
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,088
Nothing Alex says means anything users they could all this

2028
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:46,976
In this next clip we get another introduction it's a Infowars stalwart

2029
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,560
It's Barrett

2030
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,864
Lowe's

2031
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,144
Next speaker coming up

2032
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,168
He's destroyed

2033
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,824
Owen Shroyer come out here

2034
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:08,480
Really

2035
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,320
We're winning

2036
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,368
The goblin for losing

2037
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:18,720
And Judge Amy Berman Jackson is getting ready for a prison cell

2038
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:21,792
Always a good time

2039
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
Going to be part of x-ray

2040
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
Believe me we're winning

2041
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:32,032
Alright alright alright alright

2042
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,872
There's a very interesting Dynamic it played this free speech Summit

2043
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,920
One thing is that Owen isn't drinking

2044
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:40,224
Consistent motivation

2045
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,296
He comes off as a level-headed comparison to be

2046
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:47,136
Play Drunk Alexandra grab-bag of losers who has spoken so far

2047
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:49,440
This might be my Somali pirates

2048
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:55,072
But you kind of have to give it up to Owen for keeping his wits about him when he could have just got wasted and had a good time

2049
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,376
The second Dynamic is important

2050
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,080
It's still mostly empty but what's happened is that at least by the point When likely Stranahan was on stage

2051
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,872
Nick Fuentes has fans showed up

2052
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:12,224
No papers are there and they make up significant portion

2053
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,272
Another crowd and say like

2054
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:18,880
We've only talked about Nick Fuentes showing up on Alex's show in past

2055
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,904
But he's been aghast

2056
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,440
Couple times 2

2057
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:27,328
I've mentioned this a number of times that the younger more online radical types are more likely to show up on

2058
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,376
Joe and Nick is a prime example of that

2059
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:36,288
Alex is a bit of an embarrassing old man for them to utilize its platform to disseminate their views but privately their own

2060
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,592
Also probably doing impressions about other women

2061
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
Talking about gay frogs

2062
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,920
Owen is cooler

2063
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
Is Identity the most

2064
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,504
To them okay that's

2065
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
That's fair

2066
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:50,112
His identity is mostly caught up in the cup Destroyer imagery and

2067
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,928
Is public existence doesn't have the same baggage that Alex.

2068
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:59,840
He's only really been on Infowars for a few years and most of that time is coverage has mostly been the anti-sjw stuff

2069
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
Acting like a big boy

2070
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,448
Plus working in his favor is affected

2071
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,496
I don't realize a bad

2072
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:10,080
You can hear from that much larger Ovation that Owen got

2073
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,872
He came to the stage that the

2074
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
In the room is shifted

2075
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:15,712
And that's because the Fuentes fans are there

2076
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,504
And someone they like his taking the stage

2077
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,576
It's very strange to see high-status Shroyer

2078
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:27,744
It's entirely possible that I'm just being Blinded By The Staggering incompetence.

2079
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:31,072
But he's showing a confident in charge present

2080
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,352
And that's pretty weird

2081
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:37,472
I don't like it I don't like the I don't like the way people to clap I don't like him coming up like

2082
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:42,592
Walking up to the podium be like all right

2083
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:48,736
Alright I know you love that guy I don't I don't like it at all

2084
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:53,088
If it makes you feel any better they don't like him enough to laugh at a bad joke

2085
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:58,976
But I another indication is so I was live all day from c-pack I saw a lot of you there

2086
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:04,608
I didn't have time to eat or shower I go back to my hotel I change and I show up today and I realized

2087
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,144
I forgot my belt

2088
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,472
So please nobody tell Rodger Stone

2089
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:12,800
Legend Lance

2090
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,360
Who did not land as well as I think

2091
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
The rice getting too good

2092
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:24,576
Call DJ.

2093
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
Adrenochrome

2094
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:29,952
Talking about why he likes working

2095
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,256
I'm lazy

2096
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,024
Yeah

2097
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,096
I don't really like planned speaking events

2098
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,632
Because I'd rather speak from the heart

2099
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:38,912
And

2100
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:44,544
I feel like there's some sort of pressure to prepare something when you come up here but

2101
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
So much

2102
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,616
And there's no other platform like it

2103
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
And

2104
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,944
Alex has left the building its kind like Austin

2105
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
Some powers like where's my

2106
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,736
My father's like

2107
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,552
Galaxy 11

2108
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:02,720
No but seriously I can't think Alex enough for building a platform because there is no other platform that would allow me to do what

2109
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Totally

2110
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:10,912
I think that's accurate yeah yeah yeah

2111
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,496
You are correct

2112
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,312
I can't dispute any of you like

2113
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,336
Factual

2114
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:24,736
Statements is magnificent don't think there's any virtue

2115
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,528
It's like people watch

2116
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,088
Talented performers

2117
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,880
And they're like look at how effortless

2118
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
This is

2119
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:34,720
I shouldn't have to do any work

2120
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,024
And they don't realize how much effort it

2121
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,584
To get to the point where it looks like you're not try

2122
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,192
It's so much work you learn that by trying

2123
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
Stop doing that you can get a good job

2124
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,336
Owen razzing

2125
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:53,408
Alex not being in the room

2126
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,736
And he's I think he's a little bit hurt by that actually

2127
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,808
You making a joke about it and that's it that's all good

2128
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
It's all good

2129
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,904
He brings it back up at the end of the speech

2130
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,464
So funny and then this is where things get

2131
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,232
Buckwild

2132
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,280
Nick Winters is coming up next

2133
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
There's Alex

2134
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,632
Hey Alex thanks for missing my speech man really meant a lot

2135
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,704
Really meant a lot man

2136
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:20,544
No seriously I wish I was I was I was thinking you

2137
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:23,104
And I want to make sure you're here to introduce Nick Fuentes

2138
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,248
But you guys really are the revolution you really are

2139
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:33,344
Patriot and we forgot what it's like to work at Infowars latest until

2140
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,392
Come on let's go

2141
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,416
And we've got

2142
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,720
We got General Flynn son here

2143
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:39,488
Denied

2144
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,048
So you need to come up there and pick

2145
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,400
So if you recall Alex met Ivan raiklin the last time you rented at the

2146
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:49,984
The DC Press Club did a big press event about how he wasn't on social media

2147
01:46:54,080 --> 01:47:00,224
I suspect part of the reason they became Fast Friends is that Ivan is an associate of the Flynn family and Alex wanted any

2148
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
Kind of access he could

2149
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,040
I even tried to run

2150
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:06,880
In the 2018 Senate race in Virginia but was disqualified

2151
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,672
Because of invalid signatures

2152
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:11,744
But as best as I can tell he's not in a dude

2153
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,584
Congressional candidate situation in this cycle currently

2154
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:21,984
So that means you probably just here to talk s*** and Mike Flynn Jr is a guaranteed pass to get on stage

2155
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,032
This is surreal stuff

2156
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,056
This kid like

2157
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,384
I I got a very visceral reaction

2158
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,456
I totally get that

2159
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:37,856
That reminds me so much of what I would have days without like to work

2160
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:42,208
That's such like when I was a baby,

2161
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:45,024
Empress has left the room

2162
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:51,424
Friend of the show but when I was like a year in and Marty was headlining at the middle of the

2163
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
Nowhere show

2164
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:55,008
Bridgeport or whatever

2165
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,056
Great Berrington

2166
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:01,408
And it's like he walked out of the room during my feature set and I was just

2167
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,456
Oh no

2168
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,760
My hero doesn't like

2169
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
But you realize sometimes people alive

2170
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:18,816
Simile

2171
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,376
Bikeland Juniors spare

2172
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,240
So Alex really wants Mike Flynn Jr to come on stage

2173
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:30,848
He's bringing Ivan onstage explicitly

2174
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:32,384
And here is Ivins worth

2175
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:36,480
Hey Ivan drink Patriot US Army Officer lawyer

2176
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,528

01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:11,296
Like what the f*** is going on like Ivan

2185
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:13,600
Yeah I even end up spending about

2186
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,392
3 minutes talking about like

2187
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,952
I don't know why I'm up here

2188
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:18,976
He's just

2189
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,000
Kind of weird

2190
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:26,144
It becomes really clear what he's doing here and then everything

2191
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,424
Explode

2192
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,728
This is this is

2193
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,032
Big Tech takedown

2194
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,568

2195
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,360
How would you do that

2196
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,152

Safe secure search

2202
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:55,584
So here we have become clear

2203
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,864
From this group

2204
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:03,520
Are much like when Tommy Collins got into it being like this being a fundraising thing Alex

2205
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:07,360
Pretty quickly get up onstage here to to cut this off

2206
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,128
Big Shaq

2207
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:11,712
Hey I like General. You get up here and talk

2208
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,808
Ivan raiklin on Twitter

2209
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,088
Alright

2210
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,696
America is a way that's what's happening now get ready for

2211
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,960
Hi both

2212
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:38,336
So there's so much going on.

2213
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,616
Falling for the same

2214
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:43,200
Foolish perception the top Shark Tank

2215
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:45,504
Yeah I got a fundraising this beleaguered

2216
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
And then

2217
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,552
I think Alex said

2218
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:51,904
The speech that Ivan was given was going into business for himself

2219
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,696
So all bets are off

2220
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:57,280
Ivan's already said no to Alex's request for Flynn to speak

2221
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,840
Ivan's being a dick so Alex forces the issue

2222
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,376
Ivan leave stage

2223
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:04,448
Pop-ups

2224
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,984
But unbeknownst to him

2225
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,544
Mike Flynn Jr his come on stage behind him

2226
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:12,896
Alex in my greet each other and Alex Bumble that we talked online

2227
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
Before

2228
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,224
This becomes his big victory

2229
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,784
He's now got Mike Flynn Jr

2230
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,064
Okay

2231
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,088
Weather

2232
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,112
The fuk is about to happen

2233
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,648
Bump that bites not itch

2234
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,672
As exciting is

2235
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,952
Oh god dammit

2236
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,656
I'm coming out with his dad's in a sentence

2237
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:39,776
Watch fireworks

2238
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,056
Verizon

2239
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,080
F****** wasted

2240
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:47,712
Flynn starts talking about how this russiagate things been real hard

2241
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,760
And so here's

2242
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:50,784
It is well

2243
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,320
I can tell you that

2244
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,624
You know I I kind of describe what

2245
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,648
What's been going on with

2246
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,488
With my family and everything else that's that's having with all this

2247
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,024
Yeah Russia gate s*** in

2248
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
It's like kind of like a

2249
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,352
This long boxing match

2250
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:06,400
Time in 215 Brown now we feel like things

2251
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
Kind of winding down and

2252
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:14,080
I have a really difficult time with this situation because on the one hand Mike Flynn Jr is a dumb dumb

2253
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:18,944
And he's definitely spreading misinformation on

2254
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,528
But on the other hand I don't want to shoot him too hard when he's talking about how this

2255
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:25,344
The effect this investigation has had on his family

2256
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,416
Because on some level that still feels like it would be shity

2257
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:34,304
Like his mother as far as I know wasn't involved in any of this

2258
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,888
Find some sort of empathy it's important

2259
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:44,288
Hold on to some of their are people involved in that family there are having to suffer consequences because

2260
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
These people action

2261
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:50,176
No granted that's the same for all sorts of people who are related to criminals

2262
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,992
You know it's not it's how I don't want to I don't want to

2263
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Punch tool

2264
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
You're right

2265
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
Suck my foot

2266
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:04,000
So anyway I just pulled this quit because there's no boxing match in the present-day there will ever be in the city

2267
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:08,608
Brown professional boxing limits fights

2268
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:12,960
Professional boxing limited flights to 12 rounds

2269
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:17,568
1982 Ray Mancini

2270
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,336
Call Kim

2271
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,152
In a match that went to the 15th round which resulted in Kim

2272
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,712
Collapsing into a coma immediately after the fight

2273
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:26,528
Getting emergency brain surgery and dying four days later

2274
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:31,904
Richland Junior was like one-year-old and that happened so his whole life boxing matches have been 12 rounds

2275
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:38,048
He was referencing the old days 1920 Queen's rules when you would fight

2276
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
Until one guy fell to the ground

2277
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:44,192
20 rounds unless multiple sterilizer

2278
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:47,008
Sure whatever

2279
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,664
Anyway I'm talks about how innocent and Alex control himself he has to jump

2280
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,968
And look I'm not up here

2281
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:58,272
Myopathy right now looking for something I'm just

2282
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,808
I'm just letting you know that

2283
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,088
You mean this is the truth

2284
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
What happened

2285
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,392
Miami

2286
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,928
My mother's not guilty of anything

2287
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,488
I think I seem to think about your nose at and

2288
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
It has also

2289
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:14,144
So look at

2290
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,424
Last thing I'll say is that

2291
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:22,336
B complex

2292
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:28,736
Question answer about your father is a patriot and what you guys went through in the Vintage

2293
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:29,760
Location now

2294
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:32,064
It's a whole life coming down

2295
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,392

2296
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:39,232
Tell him in 5 minutes what happened what you guys went through that the American Patriot

2297
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024
Yet

2298
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:46,656
This telling me that Alex has tried to get my Flynn on his show and he said

2299
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:52,032
This is his opportunity and the speech that is given is not going

2300
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:55,872
The directions necessarily that our tentative it's not Sensational enough

2301
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,152
He's trying to direct

2302
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,432
Pops up on stage

2303
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
And he says that

2304
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:03,552
WinStar trying to answer that question and it's not well enough

2305
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
All the sudden this stuff

2306
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,928
You know kind of came down with

2307
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,952
With having to

2308
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,256
Ohio lawyers in end

2309
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:17,120
Yeah well I mean

2310
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:24,544
He day when I visited my father because he was outspoken on a number of things but the main thing was Obama's

2311
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,872
Signature foreign policy which was which was it which was the

2312
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,896
The Iran deal

2313
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:31,456
Mini Iran Iran Iran

2314
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,480
But I can say that

2315
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,784
It was it was a big thing that he was

2316
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,344
Yeah that he was

2317
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:40,160
He was highly against and there's a lot of people on

2318
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
Major major critical that

2319
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:46,048
Alex cannot handle this

2320
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:48,352
Got to micromanage I got a direct

01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:56,288

2323
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,080
The audio but there's a lot of people

2324
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,384
In the room and we know

2325
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:04,480
From doing shows that there's ways to deal with that and then there's ways to deal with that

2326
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,528

01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,640
We appreciated his report America

2335
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:34,944
Realize that persecution is actually a blessing

2336
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,480
And we don't see ourselves

2337
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,040
Victims

2338
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,832
Just like Rodger Stone

2339
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:44,416
And just like some other people they tried to put his father in prison

2340
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,976
They try to hold years in prison

2341
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,768
And bankrupting them

2342
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,840
Did lie about President Trump and lie about

2343
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,888
The populist election we had

2344
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:56,192
Fire a lot of talk I love you guys

2345
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,216
Disrespect

2346
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:59,264
Goodbye just stop talking for one second

2347
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,056
Just just one second

2348
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,152
Just one second your life

2349
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:08,736
His father wanted to serve America

2350
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:11,040
And try to defend our Republic

2351
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:15,392
And because

2352
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:21,536
A good speaker dude targeted him because he wanted to put in the Trump Administration

2353
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,560
Patreon

2354
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:26,400
That would promote Freedom worldwide they were scared of the army

2355
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,936
The George Washington founded

2356
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,984
245 years ago

2357
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:33,312
Finally getting control of the government again

2358
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,592
From these communist

2359
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,616
Republic

2360
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,640
And dead

2361
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
They want

2362
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,200
Every attack they had

2363
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:43,808
So I think anybody has produced a comedy show can relate to that moment Alex just had

2364
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:47,648
Are you trying to run a show and there's some people who won't stop talking in the back of the room

2365
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:50,720
Maybe it's bar patreon patrons maybe it's

2366
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:53,280
Other Comics that you need them to shut up

2367
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:56,096
You have a headliner was dropped into been on television

2368
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:57,632
It's make-or-break.

2369
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:00,448
You need this to go well so you panic a little bit

2370
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:03,264
It's too late at this point would produce a better show

2371
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,312
Except

2372
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,104
Sure you couldn't see the people better

2373
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:12,224
Not sure you could have not spent so much time to settle yourself

2374
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,504
Sure you could have just

2375
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,904
Not let any dum dum running for congress to 15 minutes but it's too late for that now you need to fix this now

2376
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,464
The yellow people to shut up

2377
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:26,816
Yeah I don't think I've ever done that myself

2378
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
But I come close

2379
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:30,144
And I've definitely seen host use that move

2380
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
A bunch

2381
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,960
It never works

2382
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:33,728
Everybody

2383
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:38,336
We got a really good show going on could you guys just please be quiet

2384
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:43,968
Can you please turn off the TV

2385
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,248
Never

2386
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,272
Because you haven't

2387
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:48,832
Shown them why they need to pay attention

2388
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:49,856
If you can scold

2389
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:54,464
Now where this stops being relatable almost starts

2390
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,000
Crying about General Flynn

2391
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:58,304
It's not surprising for Alex to get

2392
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,096
Emotional talking about America

2393
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:03,168
I was shocked to hear

2394
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:09,056
Globus tours Ephrata was the General Flynn was trying to get the military to be in charge of the

2395
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,640
Is that what Alex's wanted this whole time

2396
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,664
If I'm not much mistaken

2397
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,224
He was super anti-military until at least

2398
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:22,624
Surround like 2009

2399
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,160
Militarized state

2400
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:30,816
It seems like everything he stood for since at least 1995 has been strongly in phatic Lee opposed to the idea of the military

2401
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:36,448
Being in control of the state but he is crying on stage with Mike Flynn son

2402
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:39,776
Jammed up his dad cuz he was going to bring the military back in charge

2403
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,056
Since f*****-up

2404
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,336
Mike Flynn son

2405
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:44,128
Already said no to

2406
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,968
At least

2407
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:52,064
Was clearly not being paid attention to it

2408
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:58,720
And then was suddenly and loudly interrupted for this by and then continually ask questions and interrupted by

2409
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,744
By the variable

2410
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,280
That you are talking to

2411
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:05,888
Who is now kicked you off the microphone that is standing right next to you

2412
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:08,704
Screaming about how he loves George Washington

2413
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:15,104
And about how your dad was trying to get the military in control of a government which seems like

2414
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:19,456
Maybe I don't want that I don't want you to put me into bed

2415
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,832
This one I'm going to have to know about the

2416
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,600
This what I'm sorry

2417
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:33,024
I feel like that's a bad day. Kind of phrasing is really weird very counter to all the things that Alex teams

2418
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:33,792
Tubi

2419
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:35,840
Against

2420
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:37,376
Obama was black

2421
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,144
The end

2422
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:43,008
I think it's really upsetting to cuz it's accompanied by this demonstration which seems like

2423
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
Pretty sincere drunk emotions

2424
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:47,104
Like obviously she's Hamming it up a little bit

2425
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:49,920
When Junior bud

2426
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,200
Seems fairly visceral

2427
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:53,504
George Washington such a good coder

2428
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,808
Ready-made Windows never

2429
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
Covid-19

2430
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
It's it's best friend

2431
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:01,696
Alex breakdown

2432
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
Watching this

2433
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:07,840
I got the sense that maybe this is too weird for Flint Journal

2434
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:13,984
We have discredited Obama

2435
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:16,544
We have discredited Hillary

2436
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:21,152
We ever like my pictures on hold

2437
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:24,224
America has had a great victory

2438
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,296
But America doesn't have a media

2439
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,832
To tell you the victory man

2440
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
Check

2441
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:32,416
So General Flynn faces fake sentencing

2442
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:34,720
And I say like I told Rodger Stone

2443
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:37,024
Call their Bluff

2444
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:39,328
Because we've done nothing wrong

2445
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:42,400
We're good people saw General Flintstone God bless you

2446
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:48,800
Are you though

2447
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:52,128
You're a good person

2448
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:54,432
Father's Day

2449
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,480
You know

2450
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:59,296
Get attacked by CNN

2451
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:03,648
If you're able

2452
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,976
Boy George George

2453
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:08,512
Wow

2454
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,816
America

2455
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
Is rising now

2456
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:19,264
And the enemy knows it

2457
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,336
Tell him the truth

2458
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:28,992
Alright I'm in the lot the last thing I'll say is is we still have a fight in front of us

2459
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,064
I think

2460
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,344
I mean I don't know I don't want it

2461
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:38,720
Assume too much but if you're Mike Flynn Jr you probably got to get the sense that first of all

2462
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,768
Wasted

2463
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,792
Seems to be about you

2464
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:48,448
You seem to be projecting your situation on my father

2465
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,728
Lightest possible

2466
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:53,312
Get through this level of professionalism from her

2467
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:55,104
From habit

2468
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,664
I think it's bless professionalism in more just like

2469
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,432
What's the

2470
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,992
That's fair

2471
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:04,320
Performer

2472
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:07,136
I know I'm up for me wait then becomes

2473
02:03:07,648 --> 02:03:08,416
I'm burning the stage

2474
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:13,024
And I'm making sure that nobody will ever forget my name and it will not be

2475
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,560
Be good I understand

2476
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:19,424
Anybody speaking at this event

2477
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,776
I also can relate to the Roses like it's not worth the trouble

2478
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:26,336
Is going to be a mess and I don't really care.

2479
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:30,944
To do it

2480
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,504
This is another example of personal Pride

2481
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:38,624
Alex is more humble about this

2482
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,416
But you came up here tonight

2483
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:43,232
I know under major pressure and persecution

2484
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:48,096
To tell the truth when closing

2485
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:49,120
In person

2486
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:52,448
Why you decided to come out and pick up your father's tonight

2487
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:57,312
I think it's because you know the tide has turned the whole is broken

2488
02:03:57,568 --> 02:04:03,712
Where are American we're not watching agents we love or something

2489
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:07,552
We believe in America why did you come out tonight

2490
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:14,720
I came up here with with Ivan Raven I don't know where he's at he's

2491
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:17,792
Ivan's always dragon

2492
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,608
Unn in five different in 5 minutes

2493
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:24,448
Different directions to 1st pack before in our next couple days

2494
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,008
Hey Alex really wanted Mike

2495
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,032
To say like

2496
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:31,360
I came because your audience is so important

2497
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:33,408
Alex wanted

2498
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:36,736
Or you didn't get it

2499
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:40,064
Android's follow Ivan around

2500
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,880
Ivan want you to be able to plug his search engine in the last

2501
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:47,744
I came so close friend of mine

2502
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,512
Conference

2503
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,048
And I don't want to ever see him next

2504
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,864
So Flynn

2505
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,680
Mike Flynn JR says that his dad will be back

2506
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,240
This is just

2507
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,288
I mean you nailed it earlier

2508
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,592
Just as Alex

2509
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:06,688
Progresses through this he thinks he's doing

2510
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,712
The co-host

2511
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,272
But I can say it

2512
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:13,088
That that that his time is not done he will get

2513
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:13,856
His

2514
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:20,512
He'll get his ass back out there and nnnn speak out about the things that that need to be spoken out about

2515
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,192
I tried generals on General Flynn baton America

2516
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:31,008
3 plus years ago tried to put the lighthouse

2517
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,288
Stockwood Patriots

2518
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,312
He was attacked

2519
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,592
Is Enemy Number One

2520
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:39,456
Four years later we're turning the tide his son is here with us tonight

2521
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:44,832
It's a beautiful time God bless you tell your father words out of them

2522
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
You can't let

2523
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,184
Blinn Junior have the last word in his own speech

2524
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:51,488
I was cutting off in the middle of a set

2525
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,816
What's so f***** up

2526
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,352
And he totally grabbed

2527
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,680
He had absolute that moment where is like

2528
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:07,616
You totally grab

2529
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:09,664
You can't leave yet

2530
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:16,320
So slim Juniors done and now Alex has mix 20s, gosh

2531
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,344
Sure

2532
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,624
Introduces neck

2533
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,160
And I think you can tell

2534
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:22,464
Fairly well mostly

2535
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:23,744
Well

2536
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:26,048
Hard to follow this Nick Fuentes

2537
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,352
Who challenged the Republican sensors

2538
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,656
And the New York Times on the chai Comcast

2539
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:52,672
Thank you

2540
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:58,560
He's getting sustained Applause it carry on bag

2541
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:02,656
Nick comes on stage I think you'll be able to

2542
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:05,984
Tell immediately how much battery is at this then

2543
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,264
Almost everybody else

2544
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,664
It's been there wow it is great to be here this is been a very often and I've been to see pack for

2545
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:18,016
Two years now I went to seapac in 2018-2019

2546
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:22,624
2019 I wasn't supposed to be there actually got kicked out or they they try to kick me out

2547
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,160
If you remember last year

2548
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:30,816
But I have to say this is way more fun than snot haha than here I don't think so

2549
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:34,144
First of all I just want to say thanks to

2550
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:37,984
The national file everybody with the national file for hosting this and

2551
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:44,384
A big thanks of course to a big thanks to Infowars and Alex Jones for having us all here and

2552
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,408
Alex Jones is

2553
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
High energy

2554
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:53,344
I know I sound like a broken record about these various small details of live performance but it's really one of the things that in

2555
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,392
Just admit the most of my time doing stand-up

2556
02:07:55,904 --> 02:08:01,024
There's little things that any performer can't cannot do a huge effect on how they're perceived by Nadia

2557
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:07,936
When the really common ones is a comic coming on stage taking the microphone out of the stand and casually moving the mic stand to the back of

2558
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:08,704
The stage

2559
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,288
It's a simple routine action that indicates that the performer is Eddie's

2560
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,056
And they're able to

2561
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,080
We control their surrounding

2562
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:16,640
But if they fail to do this symbolize

2563
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,456
They end up with a bike stand between them and the audience

2564
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,248
Obstructing the view from the crowd which

2565
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,016
Distance

2566
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:26,112
The, could leave the mic in the stand and then that's a different thing that's a stylistic

2567
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,136
Choice

2568
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:30,976
If you see a performer take the mic out of the stand

2569
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:33,024
Conscious signal if this person isn't

2570
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,560
In controlled airspace

2571
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:38,912
The same messages sent by a comic concedes too easily to a heckler

2572
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:41,728
If someone in the audience yell something out you don't have to

2573
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:42,496
Destroy them

2574
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:44,800
Anything but ignoring, altogether

2575
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:48,384
We're behaving in a way that allows the audience member to squirrel point over you

2576
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:52,736
Decreases your status as the center of attention and tells the audience that they're not in good hands

2577
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:56,576
They can't trust the performer to get through whatever they're about to do

2578
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:59,136
Before I even started doing stand-up

2579
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
My uncle worked

2580
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:02,976
Comedy Club

2581
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,512
Indianapolis It crack

2582
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,328
And we were hanging out with the headliner at

2583
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:12,192
And he was he was just talking to his literally I remember this

2584
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,984
To this day if him just saying

2585
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:17,824
I can tell how long a stand-up has been doing it just by how they take them

2586
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,408
It's like that is the signal so

2587
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,176
Easily once

2588
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,480
Once you catch it you know it

2589
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:31,648
I bring all this up because immediately when he got to the podium Nick Fuentes carried himself like a guy who's in control of the situation

2590
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,720
He takes the stage and immediately expresses graciousness

2591
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:36,768
Event organizers

2592
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:40,608
I'm the same way professional comic will make a point to draw the audience's

2593
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,936
The other comics on the lineup in the wait staff

2594
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,008
Descendant explicit message that endears you to the audio

2595
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:53,152
It's your time with the microphone but you want to see some of that time to give it up for The Unsung people who made the

2596
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:53,920
Possible

2597
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:55,712
It's a very little thing

2598
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:56,480
And you see it

2599
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:59,040
Pretty much every decent headliner at a comedy show

2600
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,576
But Nick isn't the headline

2601
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:05,696
This event there's more speakers after him and literally no one else has behaved like this throughout the entire time

2602
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:09,024
These are subtle cues that Nick is sending me he's above all day

2603
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:11,328
Results of magnanimous and gracious

2604
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:15,680
He's acting like a celebrity drop-in performers grateful to do your bar show

2605
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
Thrilled to be there

2606
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,776
For my time and tomatillos safety James Adomian

2607
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,336
Nick Fuentes is a real piece

2608
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,360
S*** but he's good

2609
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,896
You think switch is really bad

2610
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,944
Trouble

2611
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:31,296
Nick Fuentes seems to be coming up Maurice Sendak

2612
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,088
Figure in the world of Infowars

2613
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,624
Might be a sort of things

2614
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,392
Spell trouble

2615
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:41,792
We've seen in the past out easily Co-op

2616
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:47,680
Assholes to whatever intern told Alex that fortune

2617
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,448
He suggests

2618
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:50,496
It feels like there's a decent chance

2619
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:53,824
The Nick is going to become a far bigger and more prominent figure in our world

2620
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,896
So I figured it might be worth our time

2621
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:57,920
To take a little bit of a

2622
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,456
Trip

2623
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,272
To learn a little bit more about where this guy comes from

2624
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:04,320
God damn it I hate it

2625
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:06,880
Well you might be interested to learn some of the stuff then

2626
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:12,256
So as we know Nick Fuentes is now a Firebrand crypto-fascist Catholic Catholic Nashville

2627
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,792
In traditional

2628
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,864
Who prefers to some himself up as America

2629
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:23,520
Sure broadcasting show by that name on YouTube until he was recently booted from the platform for repeated violations

2630
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:30,432
He's become a very public s*** head and one of the things that makes him so particularly notable is that he's very young

2631
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:36,832
Nick is only 21 years old and despite his Youth and inexperience in life he's managed to create a sizeable following

2632
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
Of disaffected

2633
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,392
Conservative young white man

2634
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,160
Who call themselves

2635
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:40,928
Scrapers

2636
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,208
Which is apparently a referee

2637
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
Pepe the Frog

2638
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:47,840
Great difficulty starting the world of political broadcasting in high

2639
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:52,960
He attended Lyons Township High School in LaGrange Illinois which is a public school

2640
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:56,544
He's from over here goddamn state

2641
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:01,920
I thought I hated Indiana now I know that we have him

2642
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:05,248
This is a public school that has a particular care

2643
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:10,112
The student body of 73% Statewide average of 49

2644
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:17,280
More notably probably only 14% of the students at Lyons were eligible for free lunch programs compared

2645
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,072
6% average for Illinois schools

2646
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:23,680
The indicators around the school paper picture of the environment that make came into adolescent

2647
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:26,752
It's a predominantly white in affluent

2648
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:30,848
Lyons Township is a school that is an offshoot television station

2649
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,384
Call lttv

2650
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:39,040
On November 5th 2015 Nick Fuentes released the very first episode of the Nicholas J Fuentes show on LTD

2651
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:42,112
TV just a quick look at the show makes it crystal clear

2652
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:45,696
High School Nick was very similar to

2653
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:48,256
Another

2654
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,328
One thing that jumps out at you

2655
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:53,376
Is it Nick carries himself with an almost

2656
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,168
Comical level of self-importance

2657
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,960
In this High School AV class

2658
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,728
Bassproject

2659
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:02,592
You've got a suit and tie on and is sitting at a table the political Roundtable show

2660
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:05,152
Discusses the big issues of the day with two others

2661
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,688
16 year olds

2662
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:11,808
It's the same kind of a lip thing that you can see today in his speech at Alex's event

2663
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:16,160
Any normal person would not be able to carry on the illusion that what they're doing is any meaning at all

2664
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,696
But Nick soldiers forward

2665
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:24,352
He's committed to being taken seriously so he'll take a dumb conversation about the 2016 Republican primary with his high school friend

2666
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:27,680
As seriously as you would if you were posted in the MacNeil Lehrer

2667
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:34,592
And he's glad to be speaking at a quarter full ballroom with a bunch of losers and Alex drunkenly interrupting

2668
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,896
You can see that this is a skill that he

2669
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
He's at

2670
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:40,480
Putting on a brave face

2671
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,784
Some things are very different

2672
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:44,576
Here is the OPA

2673
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,856
Beaumont's from Nicks

2674
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
First show

2675
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,648
Again from November

2676
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:50,720
2015

2677
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:53,024
This is where he describes his political ideology

2678
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,560
How everybody

2679
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,328
I am Nicholas

2680
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,608
Jade Fuentes you're watching

2681
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:57,888
Chase went to

2682
02:13:58,912 --> 02:13:59,424
This is Arthur

2683
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
But I thought I'd offer

2684
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
Play small

2685
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,080
Republican

2686
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:10,176
So you can see that he identifies as a Libertarian

2687
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:16,832
Flash forward to the present and here's what he said along with Milo yiannopoulos recently did an interview with

2688
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:17,856
About Liberty

2689
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,392
Selfish

2690
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
Giving up on

2691
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:31,680
Hydrological

2692
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,472
Castlewood

2693
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:42,176
People grow up the ideologies can go from believing a thing and then a little while later they agree with a sad washed-up

2694
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:44,736
People who believe that same thing

2695
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:51,392
What does happen

2696
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,416
You think is right bro

2697
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:56,000
You're clearly something happened with Nick after November 5th

2698
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,280
2015 the change

2699
02:14:57,536 --> 02:14:59,072
What is the time 11

2700
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:03,936
It's hard to say he's not Dennis Miller it's hard to say exactly what that thing was

2701
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:07,264
I need to learn more so I watch these high school shows of his

2702
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:11,872
Is first episode with a breakdown of the candidates

2703
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,152
2016 primary

2704
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:16,224
He's in favor of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul

2705
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:20,576
But all that's way less important

2706
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,344
On Donald

2707
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Is it he's not

2708
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,344
Who does that sound like

2709
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:57,952
Sounds a whole lot like Alex Jones talking about Trump in the summer of 2015

2710
02:15:58,464 --> 02:16:04,608
Alex praised Trump being a corrupt Mobsters on the outer in South

2711
02:16:04,864 --> 02:16:07,680
Pointing out the Trump is an opportunist who is only interested in power

2712
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:13,824
Beneath the surface of the current Trump supporters and you often find them clearly expressing

2713
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:14,848
The Trump is a piece of s***

2714
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:15,616
You can't trust

2715
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,640
Back in 2015

2716
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:19,456
Yeah it's it's funny how

2717
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:20,736
Are you change

2718
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,272
Whenever somebody wins the ring

2719
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:25,856
Lindsey Graham he was so against

2720
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,392
What's Trump use against

2721
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:29,952
Nick talks a little bit more about Trump's candidacy

2722
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:33,280
In this next again from this 2015 video

2723
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:22,176
In 2015 even Nick Fuentes could recognize that the things that Trump was saying we're race

2724
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:25,504
It's a sliding scale so to Nick they might be borderline

2725
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:29,600
Considering some of the stuff Nick says these days

2726
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:34,720
Like the time in 2019 where he spent a chunk of his show expounding on his love of saying the n word

2727
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,488
Song

2728
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:38,304
Edward is a rebel

2729
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,376
You know II

2730
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,144
Say it

2731
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:42,912
Freelee

2732
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:45,216
Openly I won't say to this Shelby

2733
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:45,984
Because I don't want

2734
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,264
Band right now I don't want

2735
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:48,800
I don't want this

2736
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,080
See, dobre

2737
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,616
Nothing but so brave

2738
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:53,408
Play Rebelution

2739
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,248
Funny

2740
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,528
That's who I want to

2741
02:17:58,784 --> 02:17:59,296
Talib

2742
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:00,064
Sure

2743
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:03,392
Interesting way from that last clip

2744
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:08,000
You can see that Nick is recognized the value of trump sticking it to the public

2745
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:08,768
Establishments

2746
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:10,560
That job is done

2747
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:12,864
At that point in November 2015

2748
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,960
He doesn't serve any further purpose really needs to step aside so adults

2749
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,984
Real camp

2750
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:19,008
It's like Ted Cruz

2751
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:19,776
Income front

2752
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:20,544
Center

2753
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:25,408
At this point it really seems clear that he's not the same Nick Fuentes from an ideological perspective

2754
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,944
He's expressing a disa

2755
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:28,480
Approval of Trumps racist

2756
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:30,528
He recognizes him as a con man

2757
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:35,648
Do you resent that he's taking attention away from conservative

2758
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:38,720
Little flickers of anti-jewish inclination

2759
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:41,280
You know that you later fully embrace

2760
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,304
But they're subtle

2761
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:47,680
And even honestly they're debatable in this old clip like this one we're decide he has

2762
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:50,752
When he's talking about that Ben Carson tax proposal

2763
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:08,928
It's hard to say if that was even a dig on the Old Testament it's tough to say that is honestly

2764
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:11,744
Wouldn't even be that suspicious at all no I really

2765
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:18,400
My point is it for the most part this dude just seems like a kind of trying too hard take himself too seriously young cancer

2766
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,936
Yeah is Reese Witherspoon

2767
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,728
Alexa

2768
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:25,312
I thought this was fascinating

2769
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:30,176
Because although I definitely disagree with most of the stuff he was saying that video from political

2770
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:30,944
Perspective

2771
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,552
It's a completely different person than the one we seen as a leader of the America first

2772
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,088
It's a completely different

2773
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:42,976
Person that the guy who jokingly dabble in Holocaust denial will hiding behind calling murdered Jews cookie

2774
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,512
Something happen

2775
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,560
The change Nick dramatic

2776
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,632
And I can guarantee that it happened prior to April

2777
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,656
16

2778
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:55,008
On April 6th 2016 Nick released episode 6 of the Nicholas J Fuentes

2779
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:58,336
High schooler about Donald Trump

2780
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:00,128
By this point naked

2781
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,664
Completely changed his position

2782
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,456
He was fully on board with the trunk

2783
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,480
Which seems weird

2784
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:07,808
In this clip Nick explains that Trump will be a good president

2785
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:13,440
Trump demonstrates how we can't even have a debate about hot-button issues in this country anymore

2786
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,192
I've experienced

2787
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:31,872
I was caught

2788
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:32,896
Names

2789
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,176
How to down

2790
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,712
Ripped up

2791
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:39,296
Show me clearly Ransom anti-feminist Auntie sjw blogs

2792
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:42,368
Brought that business into his econ class and it didn't

2793
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:46,208
And now it's clear that the Bolsheviks are in charge of public education

2794
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:51,328
I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that is high school economics class wasn't even covering the wage Gap because the

2795
02:20:51,584 --> 02:20:53,376
Complexity of that issue from econ

2796
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:59,008
Prospective got outside the scope of public education in high school supply and then there was

2797
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:05,408
I wouldn't be surprised if Nick just got a bad response trying to argue against the position no one was Express

2798
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:09,504
But then goes on to discuss what made him turn the corner on Trump

2799
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
Weird

2800
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:13,344
Any other discuss

2801
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:15,904
That

2802
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:23,584
First Response

2803
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,632
Racist

2804
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:27,168
Shut Em Down

2805
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:27,936
Nevermind

2806
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:41,760
That clip is fascinating because Nick is in April 2016

2807
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:47,648
In November 2015 he was saying of trump that we don't need the borderline racist remarks

2808
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:51,488
But now he's mad that other people presumably the evil left

2809
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,792
They take Trump's comments and call them racist

2810
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,560
Weird

2811
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:56,096
Another the further

2812
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:01,472
Where Nick is saying the people just say Trump's comment the races without addressing Trump's tweet about immigration

2813
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:08,128
Back in 2015 Nick himself address Trump's policies about immigration saying quote his immigration policy

2814
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:08,896
Stars

2815
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:10,176
We're going to take the immigrants

2816
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:11,456
Push them somewhere else

2817
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,224
It's ridiculous

2818
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:17,856
Nick himself rejected the immigration talk it was supposedly behind the comments that were being called races

2819
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:21,440
And he himself a damn Trump commentary borderline racist

2820
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,720
Your months earlier

2821
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:23,744
Weird

2822
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,512
He is

2823
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:26,048
It is so much like

2824
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:27,584
This makes it clear

2825
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,120
Exactly what this kid

2826
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,144
He's like a

2827
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:30,912
Creation of

2828
02:22:31,168 --> 02:22:31,680
The feedback loop

2829
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,704
Like this

2830
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:33,984
The kid

2831
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,776
Who was only

2832
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:40,128
Like 15 or 16 or whatever he's clearly mimicking

2833
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:43,200
The f****** line just got the line from

2834
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:49,600
The GOP TV

2835
02:22:49,856 --> 02:22:51,648
Got the line from the 2015

2836
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:55,232
Then the line change from the GOP to we got to defeat Hillary

2837
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:59,584
He's created he's swept up in this this is the feedback loop and then he

2838
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,608
He finds the one

2839
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:03,168
Where he can exploit the feedback loop

2840
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:04,448
And this guy is

2841
02:23:04,704 --> 02:23:07,776
He's like a f****** ghost-in-the-shell like he was created within the

2842
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:13,920
Nothing it does feel like even stronger indications

2843
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,480
He's empty

2844
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:18,784
The other high school student in this debate

2845
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:19,808
Is not a liberal

2846
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:21,344
He's another young conservative

2847
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:24,416
He began the debate by appealing to Milton Friedman

2848
02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:29,792
If that gives you any idea of whether or not you wearing a tie

2849
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:33,632
Alright

2850
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:36,960
Actually comes off pretty well even though even though

2851
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:38,496
Disagree with some of his

2852
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:40,288
I'm not going to be

2853
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:42,848
High School

2854
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:47,968
We shouldn't do this

2855
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:50,528
Vote for Trump

2856
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:54,880
The other guy who tries to explain to Nick that it's clear the Trump Appeals

2857
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,672
Because he's an insurgent

2858
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:57,952
But he's a bad

2859
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:58,976
Kind of inserts

2860
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:00,768
What I'm talking about is

2861
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:03,840
Says

2862
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:04,608
Is that

2863
02:24:05,632 --> 02:24:06,144
He's like I'm not going

2864
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,472
Pictures side by side

2865
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,592
When he setting mean Abyss

2866
02:24:16,384 --> 02:24:16,896
Standard

2867
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:17,920
Of what we're putting

2868
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:18,944
Do you want an insurgent

2869
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:23,040
Absolutely

2870
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:24,320
And Juanita

2871
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:26,880
I wish you were sitting in my chair

2872
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,416
To look at you

2873
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,440
Yeah

2874
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,488
Really

2875
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,584
You can tell a couple of important things from that clip

2876
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:39,168
Is he well

2877
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:45,312
In the episode from November Nick was against Trump because he wasn't being a serious candidate like his first-choice Ted Cruz

2878
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:46,336
Now

2879
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,128
In April

2880
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,920
Apparently the desire for seriousness

2881
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:52,480
It's totally cool for Trump

2882
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:54,272
Wife is hotter than Ted Cruz's wife

2883
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,112
The qualification for a candidate needing to be serious has been abandoned

2884
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,928
The second thing you can see from that clip is Nick squid

2885
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:03,232
That's not an argument that's an ad hominem

2886
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,888
This is very popular in the right-wing Circles of the internet around this time

2887
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:14,496
Probably didn't start with him but Stefan molyneux definitely a big party

2888
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,264
Popularising

2889
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,544
Philosophy language

2890
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,616
Being deployed by people who didn't really understand the terms

2891
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:23,968
To deflect any criticism of their positions or what they're doing

2892
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,992
Ad hominem attack

2893
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:26,272
Got it

2894
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:32,672
That's criticism that ex post facto Dan it doesn't count that's what that means Lori I disagree

2895
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:37,792
This is a little bit of a clue to me than it might have been spending some time in those types of online

2896
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:38,560
Communities

2897
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:42,400
Third and most important thing here is that the other guy are friends

2898
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:47,520
That was established earlier so we could see him from his

2899
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:48,800
He's expressing a Feeling

2900
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:51,104
Disposition has taken is foreign

2901
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,640
This is a person who knows

2902
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,920
Are you saying you've changed

2903
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:55,968
I wish you could see things from outside

2904
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:56,736
Yourself

2905
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:00,832
What is conversation surrounds the difference of opinion about how

2906
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:03,648
Trump would lead to the International Community picking were a bunch

2907
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
Dumb dumb idiot

2908
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:06,208
Scooter like someone like Trump

2909
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:09,792
That's disgusting this next clip and I think it really reveal

2910
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:10,816
A ton of wearing

2911
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:11,584
Nick is coming from

2912
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:17,984
Parliament

2913
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,752
Will fine

2914
02:26:21,312 --> 02:26:22,592
You don't care about what our oldest

2915
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:23,360
Ally thinks

2916
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:07,648
House of Refuge

2917
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:19,680
You can see so much from that clip

2918
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:20,704
All that multi

2919
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:27,104
Cultural anxiety the Muslims coming into Europe

2920
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:35,552
Incidentally those are exactly the redpill talking points they're making the rounds in the line free

2921
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:38,880
Most of them completeness representations of statistics

2922
02:27:39,136 --> 02:27:45,024
Packaged in such a way it's could be useful to help young white men argue aggressively against multiculturalism

2923
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:49,888
To put it simply nature sounds like a guy read a bunch of Fortune and changed his whole vibe

2924
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,752
You can see another thing here to that Jabet Israel responded to

2925
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:56,288
F*** you

2926
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:58,592
32

2927
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:00,640
I'm not going to be lectured about

2928
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:05,760
Set the thing about the Old Testament November being close to Ben Carson

2929
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:07,552
Text playing that was debatable

2930
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,088
But this one is not

2931
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:15,488
That's clearly an indication of anti-israel sentiment which is also a primary element to the extreme online

2932
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,256
Its rhetoric

2933
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:21,376
Has this conversation goes on it's just one alright meme after another you

2934
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:28,032
I think even you as someone who hasn't spent a lot of time studying the stuff I think you'll be able to pick out a couple in this clip

2935
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:29,824
America and

2936
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:37,504
Madara Pub

2937
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:42,624
And why got B24

2938
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:44,672
They don't want

2939
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:49,792
I got a 09

2940
02:28:52,352 --> 02:28:58,496
Peacock insult and conservative was really hot and specific communities around this time

2941
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:03,616
And Nick pulling it out in this conversation is a signifier of the places he's hanging out it's just a

2942
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:04,896
Forensic fingerprint

2943
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:08,992
The same goes for the opening explicit rhetoric about the West being Superior to

2944
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:09,760
Other cultures

2945
02:29:10,016 --> 02:29:13,344
There's a fundamental piece of the online far-right this time

2946
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,112
Dvornik

2947
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:14,880
Talks

2948
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:16,928
Clear dizzy just rattling off lingo

2949
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:19,488
I do learn from his cool new edgy online friends

2950
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:26,400
I think at this point it seems pretty hard for me to get away from the conclusion that between November 2015 and April

2951
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:31,264
2016 Nick Fuentes was hanging out in some real edgy right-wing communities online

2952
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,056
And as the kids say he got rid

2953
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,872
He's using all the new cool lingo

2954
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:39,456
He's repeating popular talking points from alright communities around this time

2955
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:41,248
Is Brenda's indicating the teacher

2956
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:43,808
Picnic is a complete a****** now

2957
02:29:44,064 --> 02:29:46,880
So it's easy to lose sight of the fact that he's 21

2958
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:49,952
So in 2015 he was 16 years old

2959
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:54,048
I wonder why so many of these people

2960
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:55,584
Constantly report losing

2961
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:59,680
Friends and family whenever you see a wonderful young

2962
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:01,472
Calling his friend

2963
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,264
Cervidil

2964
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:06,592
I can't imagine why they would lose friends and family

2965
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:12,480
It must be because the media is against the Bolsheviks running a media or whatever

2966
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:18,880
Essence right as far as I can tell from these snapshots it's hard for me not to see Nick Fuentes

2967
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:24,512
This is a conservative

2968
02:30:24,768 --> 02:30:27,072
When he was an impressionable sixteen-year-old who didn't

2969
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:28,864
Have the emotional maturity to handle it

2970
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:35,520
The only thing that really distinguishes him in any way from any other angry kid who just harasses people online anonymous

2971
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:36,544
Is it Nick

2972
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,568
You blessed with Talent

2973
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:44,480
As much as he sucks on so many levels pointlessly dishonest for me to pretend that he doesn't have an almost startling level of competence

2974
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,528
Even back in those High School videos

2975
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,832
He's slick and he's quick on his feet

2976
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:54,464
He's able to block a decent argument out of nowhere or come up with the deflection to an argument that he doesn't want to have

2977
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:55,744
Naked

2978
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,512
Piece of s***

2979
02:30:56,768 --> 02:30:59,840
He's fully responsible for the position that he puts into the world now

2980
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:01,888
And none of what I feel about him changes that

2981
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:05,984
But I'll never really be able to take him too seriously because at the end of the day

2982
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,056
He's just a cute about radicalized and just so happen to have

2983
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:12,640
Talented skills required to transition into being a cult leader himself

2984
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:15,712
And honestly it's more sad than anything else

2985
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:19,808
There's clearly something he desperately needed prior to April 2016

2986
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:23,648
And that had nothing to do with misrepresented European crime stats

2987
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:30,048
You probably always had a little bit of that races should head vibin him

2988
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:33,120
Change the definitions of what was acceptable to advocate

2989
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:34,400
Clearly did a number on

2990
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:37,984
Nick is not the first of the sort we won't be the last

2991
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:41,312
The only really notable thing about him right now

2992
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:43,104
Islets is mortality

2993
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:45,664
Did Denny's idiots like baked Alaska or Laura Loomer

2994
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:47,456
Because he's figured out

2995
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:48,736
This novel strata

2996
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,784
That's really what makes him know.

2997
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:54,368
Figured out this destruction

2998
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:57,952
Maybe a hundred times more effective than things employed by like Richard Spencer

2999
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:01,536
Are you packing right-wing scammers from the right

3000
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:03,328
He's essentially repeating the parts

3001
02:32:03,584 --> 02:32:04,352
What made the Tea Party

3002
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,120
Successful

3003
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:06,400
Is this time he doesn't have to

3004
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:11,776
Deal with crying all over the place that is 9 principles and 11 p.m.

3005
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,568
So when he

3006
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,848
Wait wasn't at 9

3007
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:16,896
12:00 yet

3008
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:18,944
F****** moron believe we all live

3009
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:22,528
Yeah

3010
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:27,904
So this strategy is employing of attacking things like Turning Point USA and Ben Shapiro from the right

3011
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:33,536
Meanwhile

3012
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:35,584
Whatever I wanted it's basically today

3013
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:37,632
Crypto Catholic fascism

3014
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:39,680
With a bunch of other wrinkles to it

3015
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:43,008
So you have that but that's a really good strategy because

3016
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:45,568
I need is a whole bunch of elements Dwight's good strategy

3017
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:46,848
These people

3018
02:32:47,104 --> 02:32:47,872
Cannot fight you

3019
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:49,664
41

3020
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:50,688
Second

3021
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:53,248
The people who would be opposed to you

3022
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,272
On the west

3023
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:56,576
Or the mainstream media for the most part

3024
02:32:56,832 --> 02:33:02,976
Are going to leave you alone Charlie Kirk

3025
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:05,280
The reaction that a lot of people have

3026
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:06,048
Don't think it's

3027
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:08,864
Funny that be there's this internecine fight

3028
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:09,632
Between these

3029
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:14,496
Fringe right-wing groups and never pay the attention that would be required

3030
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:15,776
In order to treat you like

3031
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:17,824
You deserve to be treated

3032
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:19,360
Sad

3033
02:33:19,872 --> 02:33:20,896
16 year old boy

3034
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:23,456
Add sounds

3035
02:33:23,712 --> 02:33:25,504
You shouldn't have no clearly Woody's

3036
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,784
Clearly his talent is

3037
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:28,064
Mimicry like

3038
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:29,088
Big from

3039
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,112
From that

3040
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:31,392
From that first video

3041
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,464
You did not hear anything but a

3042
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:36,000
Kid who is channeling

3043
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:37,024
But he's a

3044
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:42,144
Well very well really really good even now is

3045
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:45,472
I don't know what or if he believes

3046
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,240
Anyting

3047
02:33:46,496 --> 02:33:49,056
Because I don't know what her if any of these people believe any

3048
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:51,360
Congrats on the grips

3049
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:53,408
Side it could go any direction

3050
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:58,272
I have some feelings about that I think you were sincere in some of his position

3051
02:33:58,528 --> 02:34:00,320
Writing me too

3052
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:04,672
Because of how corruptible and influenceable Alex Azar

3053
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:06,976
And the way that the groypers have

3054
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:07,744
Clearly

3055
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,024
Voice

3056
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:10,816
Support

3057
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,608
And they're growing

3058
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:13,376
Strengthen

3059
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:17,472
I don't know I don't know if they're growing

3060
02:34:17,728 --> 02:34:18,240
Yeah they're growing

3061
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:21,824
And an ideologue that believes the bulshit he's feeling is

3062
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,592
Danger

3063
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:27,968
It feels like there's less of a grift element to it then other things and that's just because

3064
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,272
As far as I can tell I don't see Brandon

3065
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:32,832
From Nick like I don't see him selling

3066
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:37,696
Pills are buckets

3067
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:40,512
He's mimicking the grifters but he's forgetting the crisper

3068
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:42,560
That's what he's f****** up

3069
02:34:42,816 --> 02:34:46,656
There could be some dark money somewhere but I don't know I don't necessarily know if that's okay

3070
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:50,240
I would assume because you know he's talked about it

3071
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,288
His parents in suburbs

3072
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:53,056
Chicago

3073
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:58,688
Torpor doesn't have a lot of the quarter there

3074
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:04,576
He doesn't have a ton of overhead necessarily to what he needs

3075
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:07,648
To do until he got kicked off YouTube

3076
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:09,440
Pretty sure they based on the audience

3077
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:10,208
Instead he had

3078
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:12,512
But he wasn't monetized until fairly

3079
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:17,120
Soon before he got kicked off

3080
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:18,400
Pretty good amount of money

3081
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:21,216
And then whatever donations might be coming in

3082
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:26,336
I could see him being fully self-sustainable without having to do too much breath

3083
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:28,128
People like Alex is over

3084
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:31,968
Exerted themselves and there's too much sunk money

3085
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:35,808
Right

3086
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:38,112
Like Nick is a bit more flexible in that way

3087
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,392
Absolutely

3088
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:42,464
I wanted to get into that a little bit because

3089
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,000
I think it's interesting

3090
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,536
Wait when you see

3091
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:47,584
The way that Nick has

3092
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:50,400
Please come back on Alex's show

3093
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:53,984
Alex immediately use like you need to get weed to get you to this rally

3094
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,520
Play the audience

3095
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:58,080
Is largely next fans

3096
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:00,896
And the way he's carrying himself in charge

3097
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,432
He is

3098
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:06,272
So confident there that's going to rub off a bit

3099
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:08,064
I felt it was worthwhile to

3100
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:08,832
To take a little look

3101
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:10,624
Look at some of these earlier time

3102
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,904
Things because

3103
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:17,792
The picture of him is incomplete if you don't recognize that most of this philosophy is born out of

3104
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:21,888
This online radicalization that he clearly was subject to and he was

3105
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:22,912
Too young

3106
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:26,240
Angela like what you're saying I think I think

3107
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,776
What you said was

3108
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Is right on

3109
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,824
It's the mimicry

3110
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:33,408
In 2015 or mimicking the mainstream GOP

3111
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:37,504
Yeah I'm talking about like a Ben Carson's the leader in the clubhouse and

3112
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:41,600
The Rand Paul is great conservative but I don't know if it's going anywhere

3113
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:43,136
Very very much

3114
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:44,928
That and then is weather

3115
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:48,256
You get exposed to the online extreme stuff

3116
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,792
You start mimicking that

3117
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:51,584
And then you becoming

3118
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,888
Yeah 88 I almost see him

3119
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:57,216
He's almost like an empty vessel

3120
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:58,240
Now that I've

3121
02:36:58,496 --> 02:36:59,008
Cuz

3122
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:03,872
Like the more that I know the more that I go through listening to all of that s*** all I see is him

3123
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:05,664
Writing

3124
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,688
Writing this

3125
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:07,968
This

3126
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:09,248
Great

3127
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,552
Inexplicable

3128
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:13,344
It doesn't come from him

3129
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:14,624
I don't get it.

3130
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:21,024
Absolutely one hundred percent you don't become

3131
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:24,096
Twenty-one-year-old psychopath without some pain somewhere along the way

3132
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,400
Eat like

3133
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:28,448
It's it's almost like you

3134
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,984
He's just the avatar for these

3135
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:33,312
It has nothing to do with him it's not self-generated

3136
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:35,872
And when that rage is dissipated

3137
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:37,152
They won't stick with

3138
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:44,576
Has has

3139
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,880
Cuz he doesn't have any actual

3140
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:49,440
Talent other than mimicking that I mean

3141
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:53,280
Maybe he'll get a he be perfect as a political hack on

3142
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,560
Fox News or whatever

3143
02:37:55,840 --> 02:38:00,960
That is just a mirror

3144
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:03,264
Amplification

3145
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,032
Other things

3146
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:04,800
You take in

3147
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:08,384
I think it as you get older and grow up you can learn

3148
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:09,152
2

3149
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:12,992
Shift that for sure for sure and I think that's one of the things

3150
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:16,576
You need to worry about is him metastasizing into be

3151
02:38:17,088 --> 02:38:17,856
The mimic

3152
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:20,160
Is it becomes or whatever

3153
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:22,208
I mean it's like it's like

3154
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:26,560
Comic starting out you know you're the first thing you're doing is basically stealing nobody else

3155
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:30,656
Does persona almost universally

3156
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:35,008
Eddie Murphy

3157
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:35,776
But like

3158
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,080
I just asked

3159
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,360
I really thought

3160
02:38:39,872 --> 02:38:42,944
Coming into this from so many of the interaction

3161
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:43,968
Sims with Nick Fuentes

3162
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:45,248
His work that he was something

3163
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:46,528
More

3164
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:47,808
Then what I see him as

3165
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,344
Which is

3166
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,392
An empty it is a

3167
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:57,280
Just a mirror back the prepackaged

3168
02:38:57,536 --> 02:39:02,400
Talking points to everybody all these the gray when people are like we use talking points

3169
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:05,472
Cuz we don't get MSNBC

3170
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:07,520
Following

3171
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:11,616
The talking point that they're all say we don't use because we're not on

3172
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:14,176
Baby take away the fact

3173
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:15,200
They're getting our

3174
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,736
Self-generating

3175
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:19,808
Eonline spaces

3176
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:23,648
Listen to a ton of his debates

3177
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:24,672
And is

3178
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:25,440
Speeches

3179
02:39:25,696 --> 02:39:26,464
Shows

3180
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,000
It is easy

3181
02:39:28,512 --> 02:39:31,072
It is largely regurgitation

3182
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,864
Yeah like he's very slick

3183
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,936
He seems like a nice guy that's so annoying

3184
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:36,704
What a monster

3185
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:40,288
And he asks

3186
02:39:40,544 --> 02:39:41,824
He starts off with like a

3187
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,128
Interesting question

3188
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:44,896
Therefore

3189
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:51,296
But it is it is very exciting you know I look at this room here we've got Alex you've got all in weave

3190
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:53,088
Then we've got a lot of big-name

3191
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:56,160
And I think to myself like why haven't we done this sooner

3192
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:58,720
What a wonderful

3193
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:00,512
This poses an interesting question

3194
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:07,680
Premier Logistics perspective I have no idea why they

3195
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:12,288
But as an external Observer this entire show up till this point

3196
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:13,312
Pretty solid argument

3197
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,336
For why it hasn't

3198
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:21,248
Wind weirdo congressional candidates trying to lock up a friend weirdo votes cameras

3199
02:40:21,504 --> 02:40:22,272
Scheming to a speech

3200
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:25,344
Alex getting progressively more problematic

3201
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:31,744
I think the argument for not doing this show is pretty well spelled out by doing the show I have no idea why they

3202
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:32,768
These people weren't invited

3203
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:38,912
Talk about Alex's toxic views so much but

3204
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:42,240
What you can't have Alex Deepak just cuz he's going to try and

3205
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:43,520
Buck up the show

3206
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:47,616
Sure you know like even if Alex was a regular old middle-of-the-road

3207
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:49,920
Moderate Republicans

3208
02:40:50,176 --> 02:40:52,992
Drunk and water up on stage and trying to show with you

3209
02:40:54,784 --> 02:41:00,928
So his next class next talks about how his recent banned from YouTube makes him part of the band club

3210
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:07,328
But tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about censorship this is after all the emergency First Amendment Summit

3211
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:11,936
We have rallied and gathered here genuinely could not tell you it was

3212
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:16,032
And as you may know this is something that has touched me very recently

3213
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:18,592
Because I was banned off of YouTube

3214
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:20,128
Valentine's Day

3215
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:26,528
Yeah you may remember this still a little bit sore still hurts a little bit I mean

3216
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:30,112
We all knew was coming for years but when it finally hits you

3217
02:41:30,368 --> 02:41:36,512
I was just talking to Owen and some of the guys from Infowars they said you know you're finally part of the band plugged and from

3218
02:41:36,768 --> 02:41:37,280
Social media

3219
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:41,888
Dog video awesome I'm glad to be a part of that right

3220
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:44,192
But it does show that you're doing something right

3221
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:49,056
Here again we see that Insidious mindset of thinking the consequences equal virtue

3222
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:55,456
Make it's been banned from YouTube

3223
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:57,504
That mentality is ubiquitous

3224
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,272
In this group

3225
02:41:58,784 --> 02:41:59,552
Because it's a crutch

3226
02:42:02,112 --> 02:42:03,904
The fact that Nick Fuentes called this the

3227
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,440
21st Amendment Summit

3228
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:10,048
That is the official name of this event and he's literally the first speaker to recognize that

3229
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:11,584
You flick

3230
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,864
He gets on stage

3231
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,936
Thanks uses the name of the event

3232
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:22,336
In contrast to how everyone else has demonstrated a complete ignorance of disrespect for the normal etiquette of performance

3233
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:24,640
Because nailed almost every little

3234
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,432
He's good at this

3235
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:29,248
And that's how he's able to get away with a lot of the stuff that he does

3236
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:33,344
Because he's overly competent many of the subtle social signifiers

3237
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:35,136
Like pretending to be humble

3238
02:42:35,392 --> 02:42:36,416
Being appreciative

3239
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:39,232
This is it makes up for a lot

3240
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:41,280
This episode is

3241
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:44,096
A great way of securing right-wing propaganda

3242
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:50,752
And laughing at ridiculous and also is a perfect blueprint for how to run the show if your list

3243
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:53,056
Running you're showing it.

3244
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:55,616
If you are making any of these f****** mistakes

3245
02:42:57,408 --> 02:43:00,992
Loki I might have been

3246
02:43:01,504 --> 02:43:07,648
Really personal thinking about this a lot.

3247
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:13,536
About a lot of glass have a lot of thought

3248
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:15,840
Do you need one red curtain

3249
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:17,376
1 Rickert behind

3250
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:22,752
Nix talks about

3251
02:43:23,008 --> 02:43:26,080
Nick talks about how I use the bathroom

3252
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:26,848
Do you not

3253
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:28,128
Controlled opposition

3254
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:32,992
It's interesting for a long time if there is maybe a silver lining to being banned from YouTube

3255
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,552
For the longest time people used to tell me

3256
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:39,648
That I was controlled opposition because I wasn't banned from YouTube

3257
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:44,000
Why are you on YouTube still doesn't that show that you're still part of the system

3258
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:48,096
But thankfully now I can tell you being banned off of YouTube no

3259
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:50,912
I can't confirm I'm not a part of the system but

3260
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:53,216
So that's a cute joke

3261
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:59,616
The fact that Nick was still on YouTube wasn't the main sticking point for people being controlled opposition

3262
02:43:59,872 --> 02:44:01,664
Trump Twitter

3263
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,432
And in fact

3264
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,200
His Twitter

3265
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,480
Account is verify

3266
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:09,856
Really yeah in this interview that he did with Milo yiannopoulos you can hear him joking about that

3267
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:18,560
Grudge girl

3268
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:23,680
Twitter David which is sponsoring you

3269
02:44:24,192 --> 02:44:27,264
How do you say my last name

3270
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:30,336
Is something wrong with you I'm a grey alien

3271
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:36,992
This is a light-hearted thing and came in the form of ribbing but it's

3272
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:38,528
At least the second time in the first

3273
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:42,624
20 minutes of that interview with Milo that a joke about Nick being controlled opposition

3274
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:44,160
Because he's still on Twitter came up

3275
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:46,720
As of this recording you can still verify.

3276
02:44:46,976 --> 02:44:48,768
That's because they're trying to

3277
02:44:49,024 --> 02:44:49,792
Wait what

3278
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:53,120
I think you could tell from this next clip that this audience is

3279
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:54,656
Pretty heavily Knicks fan

3280
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:56,704
Yeah you can hear them responding

3281
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:01,824
Like how to apply other people or not

3282
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:03,616
Clear

3283
02:45:03,872 --> 02:45:06,176
Thank you for the diapers

3284
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:12,576
Wipers who are with us tonight

3285
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:14,880
Detroit versus taking over this whole week

3286
02:45:15,648 --> 02:45:21,792
Obviously like if you're in that room and you're Alex or you're anybody else you recognize

3287
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:23,584
This guy

3288
02:45:24,096 --> 02:45:25,120
Is taking over our event

3289
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:26,400
Oh yeah the audience

3290
02:45:26,656 --> 02:45:31,776
Is clearly on his side whether or not he has won them over or they came because of him

3291
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,056
He is

3292
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:36,128
To use

3293
02:45:36,384 --> 02:45:38,432
Cocking out this event that's true Alex

3294
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,200
Cousin interrupted

3295
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:45,600
Alright

3296
02:45:47,904 --> 02:45:50,464
Mixter talking about this free speech stuff

3297
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:52,512
And how the Republican

3298
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:53,792
GOP

3299
02:45:54,304 --> 02:45:55,328
They Don't Really Care

3300
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:56,864
About free speech

3301
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,144
Yeah but

3302
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:02,240
Videos of really interesting take on this and it's actually

3303
02:46:02,496 --> 02:46:03,775
Probably decent

3304
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:08,383
Point to some extent okay him

3305
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,407
Using all right

3306
02:46:09,663 --> 02:46:11,967
We know that it one point in time

3307
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:14,783
The laugh was in favor of free speech

3308
02:46:15,551 --> 02:46:18,879
We remember during the anti-war Vietnam protest

3309
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:23,743
Remember that Berkeley was supposedly the birthplace of free speech on the couch campus

3310
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:26,303
And now they've turned against free speech

3311
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:27,839
Why is that

3312
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:29,375
We all know why that is

3313
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:31,423
Because free speech is a

3314
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:33,727
Cool the benefits dissidents

3315
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:35,007
Now that the leftist

3316
02:46:35,263 --> 02:46:35,775
Power

3317
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:38,079
They have no need for free speech

3318
02:46:38,335 --> 02:46:40,639
Free speech is the means through which dissonance

3319
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:44,223
Challenge their institutional power in the establishment

3320
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:47,295
They were outside of power and they supported free speech

3321
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:50,367
Now they're inside and power and they are against free speech

3322
02:46:51,135 --> 02:46:52,927
And a similar thing actually

3323
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:54,719
Has happened on the right

3324
02:46:55,487 --> 02:47:01,631
I don't know if I agree with some of the finer points of assessment I want to leave

3325
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:05,215
Something that makes Nick super dangerous

3326
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:08,799
Nick is completely aware that the authoritarians of the past

3327
02:47:09,055 --> 02:47:11,103
Effuse bulshit free-speech whining

3328
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,151
Weasel their way into public spaces

3329
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:18,527
Do you know that George Lincoln Rockwell the founder of the American Nazi party use debates about free speech

3330
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:21,855
Is a tool to mainstream and normalizes bigoted ideology

3331
02:47:22,111 --> 02:47:22,879
That's a pretty much

3332
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:25,439
Every extreme right-wing f*** ever since

3333
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:31,071
I'm not sure he's right about the left using free-speech takeover power after the sixties consider it

3334
02:47:31,327 --> 02:47:34,399
After 1969 there wasn't a democrat in the presidency

3335
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:39,263
Other than be very ineffectual one term of Jimmy Carter until Bill Clinton took office in 1993

3336
02:47:39,519 --> 02:47:43,871
From 1969 to 1993 Democrats were only in the presidency for out of

3337
02:47:44,127 --> 02:47:44,639
The 24-year

3338
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:46,687
Which if you're paying attention means

3339
02:47:46,943 --> 02:47:48,223
Republicans were empowered

3340
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:50,015
Of the 24

3341
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:52,319
The left is in control now

3342
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,343
Obvious

3343
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:59,743
Obviously we can see that it's the left who's the right what I mean he said the Breitbart sylectus publication

3344
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:04,607
Interesting is his cake and eat it too

3345
02:48:04,863 --> 02:48:05,375
Witness clip

3346
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:08,447
On the one hand he seems to be completely exposing the game

3347
02:48:08,703 --> 02:48:11,263
I'm saying that everyone just pretends to be into free speech

3348
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:13,567
But it's really just a means for them to get power

3349
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:18,687
On the other hand he seems to be still insinuating that he on like a Democrats and Republicans

3350
02:48:18,943 --> 02:48:20,223
He's the one who actually cares

3351
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:21,247
About free speech

3352
02:48:21,503 --> 02:48:24,319
And if you were to rise to power you be the only one

3353
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:25,599
Immediately forget about

3354
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:28,927
This is an impressive level of cynicism

3355
02:48:29,183 --> 02:48:30,719
But I also think that it could be

3356
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:31,743
Dangerously effect

3357
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:36,607
There are tons of disenchanted folks on the ride were sick of people like Steven Crowder

3358
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:37,631
Entire flock of

3359
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:39,167
Free Speech proper tears

3360
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:40,703
It could be super appealing

3361
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:41,983
Nothing for them to hear

3362
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:43,007
Like on the right

3363
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:45,055
To have someone of the right call out the sky

3364
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:48,127
And ideologue who believes his own bulshit

3365
02:48:49,151 --> 02:48:51,711
Granted people like Nikkor pretty selective in their targeting

3366
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:58,111
I kill say people like Crowder Ben Shapiro are turning point they're scamming on Free Speech to gain power but you don't

3367
02:48:58,367 --> 02:49:00,159
Same complaint about Milo yiannopoulos

3368
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:01,439
What's or Alex Jones

3369
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:05,535
That's because he doesn't care about them being free speech comment he's just bitter that

3370
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:07,839
Crowder spirit

3371
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:11,423
Where's Alex and Milo or desperate that they're willing to

3372
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,703
Steven get a boost out of

3373
02:49:13,727 --> 02:49:18,335
Because people like nicker excluded from even being accessed given access to mainstream

3374
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:24,223
They can free themselves up to lob some pretty fairly accurate pratiks of the scams of the right-wing Main Street

3375
02:49:24,735 --> 02:49:27,295
To be perfectly clear or not

3376
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:29,087
Actually just bigotry

3377
02:49:29,343 --> 02:49:30,111
This one

3378
02:49:30,367 --> 02:49:33,439
Others are using Free Speech trolling as a means of gaining power

3379
02:49:33,695 --> 02:49:35,231
They don't care about free speech

3380
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:36,511
Purchasing meeting point

3381
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:38,303
That is a Fair Point that he's making

3382
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:40,607
And he's free to do it right I mean

3383
02:49:40,863 --> 02:49:41,375
But that's

3384
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:44,191
That's the way that we get into trouble with

3385
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:45,471
When the right-wing starts

3386
02:49:45,983 --> 02:49:48,031
Criticizing like the FBI and s*** like

3387
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:49,055
Like that where you like

3388
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:53,663
FBI's f****** evil and it will be harder to believe conspiracy theories about them

3389
02:49:53,919 --> 02:49:55,967
They didn't do so much evil s***

3390
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:59,551
The CIA is f****** evil they didn't do this but

3391
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:02,111
I get why you believe that cuz I would like

3392
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:05,439
How many how many Fred Hampton do we have to get murdered before it's like

3393
02:50:05,695 --> 02:50:10,303
The cops are f****** evil you know like I understand but your

3394
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,839
Doing it wrong

3395
02:50:12,351 --> 02:50:16,191
Doing it wrong

3396
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:20,031
Absolutely maybe the power that you can have as a persuasive

3397
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:22,079
Of course there's a thing Jordan

3398
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:24,383
Nick doesn't care about Free Speech either

3399
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:29,247
He is expressing that very clearly in one of the episodes from 2018

3400
02:50:29,759 --> 02:50:31,807
And I was interviewed at Charlottesville as well B

3401
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:32,575
Infowars

3402
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:35,903
Millie Weaver

3403
02:50:36,671 --> 02:50:38,975
You know she was very surprised by by the

3404
02:50:39,743 --> 02:50:41,279
Surprised by how

3405
02:50:43,839 --> 02:50:44,863
She was interviewing not sing

3406
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:46,399
Don't you think everybody has the right to

3407
02:50:47,935 --> 02:50:48,703
Me and James allsup

3408
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:51,519
No they don't these people post

3409
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:54,847
True fascist fashion

3410
02:50:55,103 --> 02:51:00,735
Nick uses the language that appeals to people but what is her little project is is working on

3411
02:51:00,991 --> 02:51:01,759
It's working on something

3412
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:02,527
Entirely

3413
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:09,183
We can show up to a first amendment rally holding a position that people he disagrees with politically don't have free speech rights

3414
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:14,559
This is because Nick Fuentes at his core is interested in creating a state that runs on Catholics

3415
02:51:15,327 --> 02:51:19,679
Here's a clip of him from his show America First discussing

3416
02:51:19,935 --> 02:51:23,007
If they were supporters of Mussolini or Francisco Franco

3417
02:51:23,519 --> 02:51:27,615
I had to take this clip from his interview with Milo's there's a little bit of laughing for Milo's friends

3418
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:28,639
In the background to see

3419
02:51:28,895 --> 02:51:30,175
That doesn't distract you too much

3420
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:33,759
And they were waving

3421
02:51:34,015 --> 02:51:34,527
The banner of

3422
02:51:37,087 --> 02:51:37,599
Adjoining

3423
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:38,879
Prank

3424
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:43,231
Flanges unless they are waving

3425
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:45,023
In the band they were just be fun

3426
02:51:46,303 --> 02:51:47,071
Catholic bashing

3427
02:51:47,327 --> 02:51:47,839
Shazam now

3428
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:50,911
I would join them I would become a part of Auntie

3429
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:52,959
I would welcome an

3430
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:54,239
Yes take over the

3431
02:51:54,495 --> 02:51:55,007
The country

3432
02:51:55,263 --> 02:52:01,407
That's sort of played for humor and I'm sure Nick will try to weasel out of this position by saying that he Sho is tiresome dumb s***

3433
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,431
F***

3434
02:52:02,687 --> 02:52:08,319
You does later in that Milo interview Express the position the Catholic theocracy would be preferable to our democratic system

3435
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:09,855
If we want to become

3436
02:52:10,367 --> 02:52:11,647
Kind of Catholic country I mean

3437
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:12,415
I don't know

3438
02:52:13,695 --> 02:52:14,719
I don't know how that work

3439
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:17,023
I wouldn't know if you prefer

3440
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:22,911
So you can see kind of some of the things that are behind his

3441
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,703
Presentation of Belize

3442
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:27,007
So he he

3443
02:52:27,263 --> 02:52:28,799
Exactly the right way

3444
02:52:29,055 --> 02:52:30,591
Like right now when we're talkin

3445
02:52:30,847 --> 02:52:32,383
So many f****** right wing

3446
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:35,199
Op-eds are being written about the Democratic

3447
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:36,223
Candidate that

3448
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:37,759
Democrats should choose

3449
02:52:38,015 --> 02:52:39,295
And it's always like

3450
02:52:39,807 --> 02:52:41,855
Well if antifa were fur

3451
02:52:42,111 --> 02:52:43,391
Then I would vote for them

3452
02:52:43,647 --> 02:52:45,183
Like it's literally if

3453
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:46,975
If people were running

3454
02:52:47,999 --> 02:52:49,023
A fascist

3455
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:50,815
The night before that

3456
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,583
Like that's

3457
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:54,399
Exactly what we're doing right now with all of that

3458
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:57,983
If the Democratic candidate would just be a Republican

3459
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:00,287
We be voting for him dummies

3460
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:01,311
Interesting

3461
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:03,359
Nickhits

3462
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:05,663
He doesn't

3463
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:12,063
Yeah we got interviewed at Charlottesville the right rally by these people

3464
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:13,343
Don't have free speech right

3465
02:53:14,367 --> 02:53:15,391
Don't Stop Believin

3466
02:53:15,647 --> 02:53:16,927
Some free speech rights

3467
02:53:17,183 --> 02:53:17,951
I think the first one

3468
02:53:19,999 --> 02:53:21,535
If I want to say women are dumb

3469
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:22,559
If I want to say it

3470
02:53:23,327 --> 02:53:24,351
Something nasty about black

3471
02:53:24,863 --> 02:53:26,655
If I want to say something nasty about you

3472
02:53:27,679 --> 02:53:28,191
And why would it

3473
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:30,239
Smile

3474
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:31,263
Pets first

3475
02:53:31,519 --> 02:53:32,799
You hear that smile

3476
02:53:33,055 --> 02:53:34,591
What's a smile

3477
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:40,991
You can hear it that I want to say something mean about why would anybody do that

3478
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:49,695
Like a real guy who just doesn't like the state of Israel is not liking Jewish people

3479
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:50,463
I would have pizza

3480
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:57,119
You can see that there's a conflict of I don't believe in free speech rights of people I disagree with but

3481
02:53:57,375 --> 02:54:00,959
Absolute necessity when it comes to me being able to say racist and hateful things

3482
02:54:01,215 --> 02:54:02,495
Some speeches more freezing

3483
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:06,847
Free Speech isn't really encroached if you want to be hateful

3484
02:54:07,103 --> 02:54:13,247
Step down on you at all

3485
02:54:14,015 --> 02:54:17,087
Want to say things like all women are dumb

3486
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:20,671
And racial slurs and all that stuff is because

3487
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:22,975
What was I talking about again

3488
02:54:23,231 --> 02:54:23,999
Unclear

3489
02:54:24,511 --> 02:54:26,303
So you have this muddy

3490
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:28,607
View of what Free Speech means

3491
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:30,655
Just a tool that Nick is

3492
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:33,215
Free to come to this

3493
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:35,263
Speech and talk about how

3494
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:36,543
Political forces

3495
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:39,359
Use pre-speech as a weapon basically

3496
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:40,639
Very scary

3497
02:54:40,895 --> 02:54:45,759
Nothing but you also see these indications that he has

3498
02:54:46,015 --> 02:54:47,039
Very interested in

3499
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:48,063
Something else

3500
02:54:49,087 --> 02:54:51,903
You know he's interested in cultivating an absolute

3501
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:52,927
Kind of power

3502
02:54:53,183 --> 02:54:54,207
Like is Catholic fashion

3503
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:55,999
Idea that he's expressing

3504
02:54:56,255 --> 02:54:59,327
It's legitimately and authoritarian religiously-based mark

3505
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:01,119
Would like to see come into power

3506
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:02,399
He's not particularly

3507
02:55:02,655 --> 02:55:04,959
Interested in the subtle free-speech cons

3508
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:07,519
Be run by people like Steven Crowder Charlie Kirk

3509
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:10,079
So much motivated in

3510
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:12,639
And in terms of bringing it over dictator

3511
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:16,479
Interested in marginalizing

3512
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:20,063
Nick's political project is much broader in scope them

3513
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:23,391
We can afford to call out the trivial game that others on the writer play

3514
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:28,511
It doesn't hurt him at all and real trick a certain amount of people into thinking that he's actually the real one

3515
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:29,279
Who's interested in

3516
02:55:29,535 --> 02:55:30,047
Free speech

3517
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:31,071
But of course he's not

3518
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:34,911
Does Wyatt's farcical First Amendment Summit

3519
02:55:35,167 --> 02:55:36,703
He doesn't believe in the First Amendment at all

3520
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:43,103
Nick expounds on this point he has about Free Speech being at the in the interest of those in power

3521
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,711
As you were waiting for

3522
02:55:47,967 --> 02:55:49,503
Here Comes Alexandra

3523
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:54,623
All these right-wing people that say they're against censorship they're in favor free speech

3524
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:58,975
That worked ten years ago when they didn't have this institutional power

3525
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:00,511
But now that they've got the money

3526
02:56:00,767 --> 02:56:01,279
And if

3527
02:56:01,535 --> 02:56:03,327
The think-tank said about the ngos

3528
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:09,727
And all that institutional power on their side where is where where is no longer convenient for them

3529
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:12,287
Where does a RN positions of power

3530
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:15,615
They do not like the free speech and we are offering up as true

3531
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:16,383
Conservative

3532
02:56:17,407 --> 02:56:20,479
Where's the park here

3533
02:56:20,735 --> 02:56:25,599
I don't care what somebody says

3534
02:56:25,855 --> 02:56:27,391
They have a right to free speech

3535
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:28,671
And what

3536
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:29,951
The establishment

3537
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:31,487
Really fares

3538
02:56:31,743 --> 02:56:33,023
Is power

3539
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:35,583
They fear Human Action

3540
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:37,887
That has that electric spark you got there

3541
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:40,191
And they're scared of you

3542
02:56:40,703 --> 02:56:43,519
And no matter what they do they can't suppress you

3543
02:56:44,287 --> 02:56:45,055
Because

3544
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:48,127
I get on there I talk about America

3545
02:56:48,383 --> 02:56:48,895
Freedom

3546
02:56:49,151 --> 02:56:50,943
I can't believe it's loud

3547
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:53,759
Nazi Alex Jones

3548
02:56:54,783 --> 02:56:57,087
Because that's all the left.

3549
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:59,135
Is this a somebody

3550
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:01,695
Trying to promote freedom is a Nazi

3551
02:57:01,951 --> 02:57:06,303
Lenoci's are a bunch of losers

3552
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:09,119
Angela

3553
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:12,191
You're a Nazi you're in a Saturn not seeing like

3554
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:13,727
Normal American

3555
02:57:13,983 --> 02:57:18,079
I'm a capitalist and I'm not going to bow down to you

3556
02:57:18,335 --> 02:57:21,407
I wasn't wearing a hat while we can talk about it all day

3557
02:57:21,663 --> 02:57:22,431
Nick Fuentes

3558
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:23,967
How they do this but

3559
02:57:24,223 --> 02:57:26,015
No one buys it anymore

3560
02:57:26,271 --> 02:57:29,855
You almost here or lampshade

3561
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:32,159
Everybody needs to stop yelling meme

3562
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:34,463
Pink elephants to keep going can we get

3563
02:57:34,975 --> 02:57:37,023
Is there catering in pink elephants

3564
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:43,423
I don't know how to put this more bluntly than Alex has no idea

3565
02:57:43,679 --> 02:57:49,823
He's drunk and at this point he seems to think that he's supposed to be

3566
02:57:50,335 --> 02:57:50,847
Speakers

3567
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:52,383
He's not paying attention

3568
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:55,455
Just interrupt Mexican is talking

3569
02:57:56,223 --> 02:57:58,783
Because expressing a very interesting dynamic

3570
02:57:59,295 --> 02:58:01,343
Which is it free speech is not in the interest of those could

3571
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:02,111
Controlling power

3572
02:58:02,367 --> 02:58:05,951
Particularly when their primary reason to pursue power the game

3573
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:07,743
Hold on to that which they have

3574
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:11,071
It's one of the main reasons that the First Amendment

3575
02:58:11,327 --> 02:58:15,423
Is there and why we need this freedom to be considered sacrosanct in our culture

3576
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:16,703
Because if it wasn't

3577
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:21,311
True Free Speech rules were up to the whims of random elected politicians and officials

3578
02:58:21,823 --> 02:58:24,383
Probably been gone

3579
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:28,223
The whole thing was in response to that f****** King being a dick

3580
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:30,015
I don't think Alex even understands the

3581
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:31,039
The point that Nick is making

3582
02:58:31,551 --> 02:58:33,599
You can hear Nick say here he comes

3583
02:58:33,855 --> 02:58:37,695
In the background Alex comes up on stage

3584
02:58:37,951 --> 02:58:38,463
To it

3585
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:40,511
He's not excited that Alex is interrupting

3586
02:58:40,767 --> 02:58:41,535
But you know what

3587
02:58:42,047 --> 02:58:46,399
Nick is the only speaker other than Mike Flynn Jr who doesn't end up responding to Alex

3588
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:47,423
Interrupting them

3589
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:50,495
With the archetypical cop-out it's impossible to follow Alex Jones

3590
02:58:51,263 --> 02:58:52,287
Not impossible for Nick

3591
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:54,847
Go to him Alec is an embarrassing full

3592
02:58:55,103 --> 02:58:55,871
Who's just useful

3593
02:58:56,127 --> 02:58:58,431
Is very possible to follow him

3594
02:58:59,455 --> 02:59:01,759
I followed many embarrassing drunks

3595
02:59:03,039 --> 02:59:09,183
It is not been that hard to find specially when you brought the crowd is very simple.

3596
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:10,719
You don't have to do that

3597
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:14,047
So Nick wants to complain a little bit about CPAC

3598
02:59:14,303 --> 02:59:14,815
Which is better

3599
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:17,375
I guess he's not welcome there

3600
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:20,959
Do you know what they're calling this year's CPAC conference

3601
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:21,983
Suck pack

3602
02:59:23,263 --> 02:59:27,103
That's right but being this year it's not a parody it's not a joke

3603
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:31,711
The theme for them this year is America versus socialism

3604
02:59:32,223 --> 02:59:34,015
And to me that says it all

3605
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:37,599
What they want us to do for the next 50 years

3606
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:42,975
History litigate the Cold War and fight this argument America versus socialism

3607
02:59:43,487 --> 02:59:47,839
They want control of the dialectic of the conversation

3608
02:59:48,095 --> 02:59:49,119
Between the two poles

3609
02:59:49,631 --> 02:59:53,983
The right as defined by hamburgers capitalism and on the other side socialist

3610
02:59:54,751 --> 02:59:57,311
I guess I'll wrap it up here I'm going to don't wrap it up

3611
02:59:57,567 --> 03:00:03,711
I just want to say this I just looking behind you

3612
03:00:04,735 --> 03:00:09,343
Alex's come up on stage

3613
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:10,111
Roast

3614
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:14,463
60th and Dean is f*** it up there be like

3615
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:18,047
Isn't it great that I say racist s*** about the

3616
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:22,655
Also at this point I'm starting to suspect

3617
03:00:22,911 --> 03:00:23,679
Sometimes Bistro

3618
03:00:23,935 --> 03:00:24,447
Strategic

3619
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:27,519
If there's one thing he doesn't want a speaker condemning

3620
03:00:27,775 --> 03:00:29,055
It's the idea that you shouldn't

3621
03:00:29,311 --> 03:00:32,895
Spend all of your time regurgitating litigating the Cold War

3622
03:00:33,663 --> 03:00:37,759
This is not cool for Alex because his entire show is real litigating the Cold War

3623
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:40,831
August expert friends are cold war hangers-on like

3624
03:00:41,087 --> 03:00:44,159
He's hiding and every bush

3625
03:00:44,415 --> 03:00:45,951
Inside every government office

3626
03:00:46,719 --> 03:00:50,559
Everything in Alex's world comes back to Cold War anti-communist fanatic

3627
03:00:51,327 --> 03:00:51,839
Think about it

3628
03:00:52,351 --> 03:00:53,887
Add organic part of the Coronavirus

3629
03:00:54,143 --> 03:00:59,263
Conspiracy has to do with his belief that the globalist are in bed with China because they want them to take down

3630
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:03,359
Which is why David Rockefeller installed Mound power 1949

3631
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:10,015
Alex's beliefs are essentially in decipherable without the understanding to pretty much everything he saying goes back to the raven

3632
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:12,319
Do some crypto-fascist from the Cold War era

3633
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:15,135
Attack on Alex

3634
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:17,183
Nikki saying is a bit of an indictment

3635
03:01:17,439 --> 03:01:18,719
Falcons primary world

3636
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:24,095
Mocking the idea that z-pack Ubi socialism versus the United America

3637
03:01:24,351 --> 03:01:25,119
That yeah

3638
03:01:25,631 --> 03:01:26,399
Pointing that out

3639
03:01:26,911 --> 03:01:27,935
Is not good for Alex

3640
03:01:28,959 --> 03:01:30,239
Mocking

3641
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:32,031
What he does every day

3642
03:01:37,663 --> 03:01:40,735
I think some of Alex's Interruption is

3643
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:44,319
In the same way that he cut off Tommy Collins would you started selling

3644
03:01:44,575 --> 03:01:46,879
He cut off Ivan reichlin when he started selling

3645
03:01:47,135 --> 03:01:50,719
I think there's a decent chance that he's coming up and being all guys guys are good guy

3646
03:01:50,975 --> 03:01:54,047
A little bit to derail the

3647
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:58,143
Thought becoming too explicit that so we shouldn't worry too much about this

3648
03:01:58,399 --> 03:01:58,911
Dichotomy

3649
03:01:59,167 --> 03:02:00,703
Is a leftover from a cold

3650
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:02,495
It's a

3651
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:04,031
It might be a little bit more crap

3652
03:02:04,287 --> 03:02:05,567
Then it appears

3653
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:09,151
I'm not either but I think there's a

3654
03:02:09,407 --> 03:02:11,455
Muscle memory

3655
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:14,015
I think you're wrong I can definitely see that

3656
03:02:15,295 --> 03:02:19,135
Because otherwise you can run on Instinct a little bit

3657
03:02:19,647 --> 03:02:22,719
There is a certain level of like 12

3658
03:02:23,231 --> 03:02:23,999
Well

3659
03:02:24,767 --> 03:02:30,911
Actually you know what I told her I am actually going to go complete 180 and agree with you wholeheartedly because now

3660
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:31,935
Now we're doing Alex

3661
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:32,703
To shop

3662
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:34,495
Now the show instinct

3663
03:02:34,751 --> 03:02:36,543
So kicked in and this is

3664
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:38,591
Hey we're not talking about that right now

3665
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:45,247
Next next line a conversation tell me about your history is

3666
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:47,295
Exactly

3667
03:02:47,551 --> 03:02:48,063
Show instinct

3668
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:49,343
Kickin It

3669
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:53,439
Answer this Rambles into Alex saying that Nick Fuentes

3670
03:02:53,951 --> 03:02:55,999
No say-so shortages calls me

3671
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:03,679
Cowboys

3672
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:05,471
But

3673
03:03:05,727 --> 03:03:06,239
Seriously

3674
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:10,591
Nick Fuentes just want things that people agree with his popular

3675
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,151
Justin wants to ban him

3676
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:15,455
Like a racecar driver that keeps winning races

3677
03:03:16,479 --> 03:03:16,991
That's all

3678
03:03:17,503 --> 03:03:20,575
To figure that do black race cards

3679
03:03:20,831 --> 03:03:22,367
Gay people

3680
03:03:22,623 --> 03:03:23,647
He just wants to have his

3681
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,671
On 2nd

3682
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:26,207
And you know what

3683
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:27,743
I'm a company man

3684
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:28,767
SA

3685
03:03:29,023 --> 03:03:29,791
Hey buddy

3686
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:32,607
I said the market ideas you get to

3687
03:03:32,863 --> 03:03:33,631
Denver run at it

3688
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:35,423
That makes us all stronger

3689
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:39,007
But they call him a white supremacist all over the news

3690
03:03:39,519 --> 03:03:41,823
And then the alo7 probably lost sinner

3691
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:42,847
Fun whites

3692
03:03:43,103 --> 03:03:45,663
Remez compounds with terrorists

3693
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:46,431
Bomb

3694
03:03:47,967 --> 03:03:50,783
Rate a blow-up black communities and create War

3695
03:03:51,039 --> 03:03:53,087
But they can never find white people to join

3696
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:54,367
That's a good news

3697
03:03:54,879 --> 03:03:57,951
It seems very wow wow

3698
03:03:58,207 --> 03:04:04,351
Alex knows that Nick has the room's attention and he's a lot of fans in the crowd so he wants to associate himself with Nick and try and see if he can get

3699
03:04:04,607 --> 03:04:06,143
Some of them to become his customer

3700
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:06,911
Yep

3701
03:04:07,167 --> 03:04:09,471
Unfortunately this depressing as event is

3702
03:04:09,727 --> 03:04:11,519
To drink to the point of nearing Clarence

3703
03:04:13,311 --> 03:04:14,079
Self in front of Nick's

3704
03:04:14,335 --> 03:04:15,103
Hip young audience

3705
03:04:15,615 --> 03:04:18,943
Also to the point that Nick isn't a racist

3706
03:04:19,711 --> 03:04:25,855
Here's a clip of him from his interview with Milo depressing of you I don't really know how he non-racist could have

3707
03:04:26,367 --> 03:04:26,879
I I think

3708
03:04:27,391 --> 03:04:28,927
The European race is real

3709
03:04:29,183 --> 03:04:29,695
I think the diff

3710
03:04:30,207 --> 03:04:30,719
Nieces are realizing

3711
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:32,511
The

3712
03:04:33,535 --> 03:04:34,047
Until very recently

3713
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:35,839
I just wonder again

3714
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:39,167
I don't know where the robbers were a lot of people say

3715
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:40,959
You said but you don't

3716
03:04:41,215 --> 03:04:41,727
Progressive RC

3717
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:42,495
Believe race

3718
03:04:42,751 --> 03:04:44,799
Is real but yet any kind of idea of

3719
03:04:47,615 --> 03:04:48,127
Bought

3720
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:50,175
Siri is a benefit of diversity

3721
03:05:00,671 --> 03:05:01,183
I would say that

3722
03:05:03,743 --> 03:05:04,255
Does it work

3723
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:09,119
Nick is experiencing a belief and scientific racialism

3724
03:05:09,375 --> 03:05:12,447
Different races

3725
03:05:12,703 --> 03:05:13,983
Can coexist with each other

3726
03:05:15,263 --> 03:05:15,775
I wonder if

3727
03:05:16,031 --> 03:05:16,799
Bryce has any other

3728
03:05:17,055 --> 03:05:19,615
Flagrantly racist things in his interview with Milo

3729
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:22,943
I am yeah

3730
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:26,015
I know I know that's

3731
03:05:27,039 --> 03:05:27,551
He is

3732
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:29,855
See

3733
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:31,903
Soccer position you are well

3734
03:05:32,415 --> 03:05:34,463
So Nick is supposed to interracial marriages

3735
03:05:34,975 --> 03:05:39,583
Position to defend getting pretty racist in the process

3736
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:40,607
Rhinorrhea

3737
03:05:40,863 --> 03:05:42,399
Find the

3738
03:05:42,655 --> 03:05:43,935
Kid keep in mind that the

3739
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:47,519
The question is not personally would you marry outside your race

3740
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:52,127
Personal bigotries that you hold

3741
03:05:52,383 --> 03:05:55,455
But you might not have a problem with other people marrying other races

3742
03:05:55,967 --> 03:05:59,551
The question has asked by Milo is about supporter opposition to the app

3743
03:05:59,807 --> 03:06:01,855
Actors marrying someone out of a different race

3744
03:06:02,367 --> 03:06:04,927
This is about whether or not people should do it

3745
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:08,511
Nick doesn't believe the people should marry outside their racial group

3746
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:12,607
I can't really see any good Arguments for that are insanely racist

3747
03:06:12,863 --> 03:06:14,399
Excuse me

3748
03:06:14,655 --> 03:06:15,423
Hey Nick

3749
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:16,447
2018

3750
03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:17,983
So obviously this is

3751
03:06:18,239 --> 03:06:19,263
She's got to be a softball Quest

3752
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:22,079
I'm just going to live this up a lot of people you calling you erase

3753
03:06:22,847 --> 03:06:25,919
I'm just going to love this one up there are you against interracial marriage

3754
03:06:26,175 --> 03:06:32,319
Because it's 2018 nobody could possibly only of the hemant races could be against

3755
03:06:32,575 --> 03:06:38,719
Rachel Maddow throw this softball up to you to put it on the goddamn tea

3756
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:40,511
Milo's response

3757
03:06:40,767 --> 03:06:43,071
Wow

3758
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:48,447
I was throwing you a goddamn softball is over but he's like

3759
03:06:48,703 --> 03:06:50,751
What people say about you is accurate

3760
03:06:51,007 --> 03:06:52,799
You didn't answer

3761
03:06:53,055 --> 03:06:53,823
Swing at the ball

3762
03:06:54,079 --> 03:06:55,103
You hit The Catcher in the Rye

3763
03:06:55,871 --> 03:06:56,383
We're going

3764
03:06:58,431 --> 03:07:02,271
It's not good

3765
03:07:02,527 --> 03:07:03,807
Is no good okay let's hear this

3766
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:05,343
Allow me to elaborate

3767
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:06,367
Wait a little bit on the floor

3768
03:07:06,623 --> 03:07:07,903
Here I think up until very recently

3769
03:07:08,159 --> 03:07:09,695
Play this is what the vast Malaya

3770
03:07:09,951 --> 03:07:12,767
Believe that I think it was actually mainstream media program

3771
03:07:13,279 --> 03:07:14,559
In a very conservative agenda on

3772
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:15,327
On the part of

3773
03:07:16,607 --> 03:07:18,911
True in the media

3774
03:07:19,167 --> 03:07:19,935
You'll get

3775
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:20,703
What's today's weather

3776
03:07:21,215 --> 03:07:22,239
Major Hollywood pictures

3777
03:07:22,495 --> 03:07:23,775
To put people in a certain direction

3778
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:24,799
Disagree with you

3779
03:07:26,847 --> 03:07:27,359
Every ad you see

3780
03:07:29,919 --> 03:07:30,687
Can I see it myself

3781
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:31,967
High tide

3782
03:07:32,223 --> 03:07:32,991
Yeah they lay on

3783
03:07:33,759 --> 03:07:34,271
But it's a joke

3784
03:07:37,599 --> 03:07:38,623
What about Muhammad Ali

3785
03:07:38,879 --> 03:07:39,391
Muhammad Ali

3786
03:07:39,647 --> 03:07:40,159
What

3787
03:07:41,183 --> 03:07:41,695
My

3788
03:07:45,023 --> 03:07:45,535
Mix

3789
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:48,863
Defense for his opposition to interracial marriage comes out of two point

3790
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:50,911
Feels like there are too many mixed

3791
03:07:51,167 --> 03:07:57,055
Great couples in advertisements his grandkids look like him so it's cool

3792
03:07:57,311 --> 03:07:58,079
He's so pretty

3793
03:07:58,847 --> 03:08:00,383
So pretty

3794
03:08:01,151 --> 03:08:02,943
Answer to the advertising

3795
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:04,991
In August 2019 researchers at the

3796
03:08:05,247 --> 03:08:09,087
Computing Research Institute

3797
03:08:09,343 --> 03:08:13,951
Gender racial diversity in approximately 86000

3798
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:19,583
73 top International brands on Instagram and Facebook 100% interracial

3799
03:08:20,095 --> 03:08:24,959
One of their questions was about just representation generally speaking but another was quote

3800
03:08:25,471 --> 03:08:28,543
Pairs of demographic groups are preferred in advertising images

3801
03:08:28,799 --> 03:08:31,103
Supercross XM interaction Conte

3802
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:31,871
Text

3803
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:35,967
Answer the representation question they found that white people appear in ads at a rate

3804
03:08:36,223 --> 03:08:38,271
Proportional to the most recent

3805
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:44,415
But that black people are way less likely to

3806
03:08:44,927 --> 03:08:49,023
And that the number looks even worse when you look specifically just a black women

3807
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:52,607
The researchers called quote strikingly low

3808
03:08:53,631 --> 03:08:57,727
Answer the question of cross-sex interaction between members of different races what do you know

3809
03:08:57,983 --> 03:09:02,591
They found that there was a gigantic tendency towards white male white female pairings in ads

3810
03:09:03,103 --> 03:09:04,639
But that raised a new question

3811
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:10,015
Which was is this just a result of their being way more white people represented in ads

3812
03:09:10,783 --> 03:09:14,111
They took into account the relative number of models of different race

3813
03:09:14,367 --> 03:09:15,391
And they found the quote

3814
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:17,951
The preference towards pairing of the same race

3815
03:09:18,207 --> 03:09:20,511
Increase sex interaction becomes apparent

3816
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:25,119
This is a classic example of people like Nick completely fabricating

3817
03:09:25,375 --> 03:09:25,887
Perception

3818
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:31,775
He's seen a few instances of interracial pairings in commercials and each time the right-wing media has lost it

3819
03:09:32,031 --> 03:09:34,847
It's mine yelling about Force beside your nation and some s***

3820
03:09:35,103 --> 03:09:36,639
Feels like this is a consist

3821
03:09:36,895 --> 03:09:37,407
Pattern

3822
03:09:37,663 --> 03:09:39,455
Now every time there's a mixed

3823
03:09:39,711 --> 03:09:40,735
Race couple in bed

3824
03:09:40,991 --> 03:09:41,759
Further proof

3825
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:42,527
The globalist

3826
03:09:42,783 --> 03:09:44,575
You trying to push race-mixing on the whites

3827
03:09:47,135 --> 03:09:51,231
Pairing I would dare say Nick would see 500 as where the pairing

3828
03:09:51,487 --> 03:09:52,767
Because mine doesn't register that

3829
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:57,887
He ignores the overwhelming prevalence of white white couples and adds because he's a racist

3830
03:09:58,399 --> 03:09:59,935
And it bothers him when he sees mixed

3831
03:10:00,191 --> 03:10:00,959
Couples in hats

3832
03:10:01,471 --> 03:10:04,543
In order to justify this anger without just admitting he's a race

3833
03:10:05,055 --> 03:10:09,151
The easiest move is to pretend that every ad you see is black guys with white girls

3834
03:10:09,407 --> 03:10:12,223
Another man is trying to push it on the Brave and Noble whites

3835
03:10:12,735 --> 03:10:16,319
It's a cowardly cop out there reveals the bigotry underneath when you actually look at the

3836
03:10:16,575 --> 03:10:17,855
Statistical analyses of these

3837
03:10:18,111 --> 03:10:19,135
I mean

3838
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:21,695
Let's just be even simpler with it

3839
03:10:22,463 --> 03:10:23,999
There hasn't been a black guy

3840
03:10:24,767 --> 03:10:25,791
A black man

3841
03:10:27,839 --> 03:10:30,911
Not have a partner

3842
03:10:31,167 --> 03:10:34,751
Apparently I have to watch the f****** Bachelor people are going to hear about it

3843
03:10:35,007 --> 03:10:37,311
Yeah

3844
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:39,359
It's so obvious

3845
03:10:39,615 --> 03:10:41,919
Especially because I was forced to watch The Bachelorette

3846
03:10:42,943 --> 03:10:44,223
And there was a black dude

3847
03:10:44,479 --> 03:10:44,991
Killed

3848
03:10:45,247 --> 03:10:48,063
I wanted to be with course didn't wind up with her

3849
03:10:48,319 --> 03:10:49,087
Because surprise

3850
03:10:49,343 --> 03:10:55,487
Evan pictures Bachelor who's usually chosen from that guy but it's

3851
03:10:55,743 --> 03:10:58,047
Pilot

3852
03:10:59,071 --> 03:11:05,215
That's all you got I have one thought about all of the bachelor in bed

3853
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:09,823
Would you like to start an offshoot podcast where you just got me

3854
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:15,967
Yeah I mean there are things like that

3855
03:11:16,223 --> 03:11:20,831
Example of unexamined

3856
03:11:21,087 --> 03:11:21,855
Jake is a kind of

3857
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:25,439
Counterfactual disappointed

3858
03:11:25,695 --> 03:11:31,839
Do right wing gets all up in a tizzy Whenever there is like one of these commercials with mixed race

3859
03:11:32,095 --> 03:11:34,655
Messenger

3860
03:11:35,679 --> 03:11:38,751
I have that and that instills in your mind if you're of this

3861
03:11:39,519 --> 03:11:40,287
Inclination

3862
03:11:40,543 --> 03:11:42,079
Read racist

3863
03:11:42,335 --> 03:11:45,663
Whenever you see one it's an ad like that it's

3864
03:11:45,919 --> 03:11:46,431
More proof

3865
03:11:46,687 --> 03:11:47,711
This happens all the time

3866
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:52,575
Registers are six out in your mind all of the ads that you see

3867
03:11:52,831 --> 03:11:53,599
That are not

3868
03:11:53,855 --> 03:11:54,879
Mixed race couples

3869
03:11:55,903 --> 03:12:01,023
Makes you mad I just makes you mad and you're racist idiot

3870
03:12:01,535 --> 03:12:02,559
And assume that

3871
03:12:02,815 --> 03:12:04,351
Because of this one ad with

3872
03:12:04,607 --> 03:12:05,375
Interracial couple

3873
03:12:05,887 --> 03:12:07,935
The entire f****** establishment is

3874
03:12:08,191 --> 03:12:09,215
Is pushing misogyny

3875
03:12:09,471 --> 03:12:12,031
Nation of audio why would it matter if you

3876
03:12:12,287 --> 03:12:13,311
PC 100

3877
03:12:13,567 --> 03:12:14,335
20

3878
03:12:15,103 --> 03:12:17,407
You already have Point narrative

3879
03:12:17,663 --> 03:12:19,199
The first time so ever

3880
03:12:19,711 --> 03:12:25,855
You can see 100 don't fit into the model but once you have it in your mind that they always do this

3881
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:28,415
Spell exact

3882
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:31,999
Muhammad Ali comment there's a bit of a game of telling

3883
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:33,279
Going on with this quote

3884
03:12:34,047 --> 03:12:39,167
I seen versions of it posted on explicitly white nationalist sites are doing that Ali said that races should

3885
03:12:39,679 --> 03:12:40,191
Or they should be

3886
03:12:40,447 --> 03:12:40,959
Separate

3887
03:12:41,215 --> 03:12:44,031
So why is it so bad that they advocate for the same thing

3888
03:12:45,311 --> 03:12:50,943
Recitation uses often a little muddy and hard to trace back to its source

3889
03:12:51,199 --> 03:12:57,343
Is that each of them are just so embellishing it's on an interview that I'll lie did a 1970

3890
03:12:57,599 --> 03:12:59,647
One with Michael Parkinson of the BBC

3891
03:13:00,159 --> 03:13:04,255
Ironic in the interview Ali is discussing how everyone says they want integration

3892
03:13:04,511 --> 03:13:06,559
But everyone the gold medal at the Olympics

3893
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:08,607
She still couldn't eat at segregated restaurant

3894
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:09,631
That's because he was black

3895
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:15,775
You pointed to the inherited pieocracy the times or the rhetoric is often Pro integration but the loot

3896
03:13:16,031 --> 03:13:16,543
Experience

3897
03:13:16,799 --> 03:13:17,311
Is much different

3898
03:13:18,591 --> 03:13:22,175
You talked about her marriage is a part of integration they tell the interviewer quote

3899
03:13:22,431 --> 03:13:26,783
I'm sure no intelligent white person watching this show and his or her right mind

3900
03:13:27,039 --> 03:13:30,879
What black men and women marrying their white sons and daughters and in return

3901
03:13:31,135 --> 03:13:32,415
Introducing the grandchildren to

3902
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:34,207
2/2 Brown kinky hair black people

3903
03:13:35,231 --> 03:13:38,303
The interviewer points out that the phenomenon he's talking about is a social problem

3904
03:13:38,559 --> 03:13:41,375
Asking people not to have these prejudices and bigotry

3905
03:13:41,631 --> 03:13:45,471
Will go a long way toward reducing the number of white people in 1971

3906
03:13:45,727 --> 03:13:47,519
Wanda grandchildren

3907
03:13:47,775 --> 03:13:48,287
Multiple races

3908
03:13:49,055 --> 03:13:52,383
Denali response but life is too short for me to be doing that

3909
03:13:53,151 --> 03:13:53,663
Educated

3910
03:13:54,431 --> 03:14:00,575
I'd rather be reading to my own I have a beautiful daughter beautiful wife they look like me we are all happy

3911
03:14:00,831 --> 03:14:01,599
And don't have no trouble

3912
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:06,975
It would be dishonest for me to say that Muhammad Ali wasn't expressing in his View

3913
03:14:07,231 --> 03:14:10,559
I bet the natural state in the world is racist living separate

3914
03:14:11,071 --> 03:14:11,583
That is true

3915
03:14:12,095 --> 03:14:17,727
Influenced by the time the circumstances of the early 70s in the United States

3916
03:14:18,239 --> 03:14:20,543
1970s only a few years removed from

3917
03:14:20,799 --> 03:14:23,103
Passage of the Civil Rights Act in the Voting Rights Act

3918
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:26,943
As well as the assassinations of Martin Luther King Fred Hampton and Malcolm X

3919
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:29,247
This context informs his position

3920
03:14:29,759 --> 03:14:31,039
At the where he was coming to

3921
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:35,647
Also in this interview I'll leave seems preoccupied with his fear of flying

3922
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:37,951
At one point you seem to imply that he can predict

3923
03:14:38,463 --> 03:14:38,975
Plane crashes

3924
03:14:39,487 --> 03:14:42,815
The interviewer asked him. He would have stopped 9/11

3925
03:14:43,071 --> 03:14:49,215
Interview interview ask him can you predict other things since Ali had been explaining how he can predict how his

3926
03:14:53,055 --> 03:14:53,823
Ali says quote

3927
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:55,871
A lot of things that I feel are going to happen

3928
03:14:56,127 --> 03:14:57,919
Like we might do half a year without a plane

3929
03:14:58,943 --> 03:15:00,223
I'm flying everyday and I think

3930
03:15:00,479 --> 03:15:01,503
Think it's time for a plane crash

3931
03:15:02,015 --> 03:15:05,855
I don't wish for nothing like that but I feel like things are too quiet

3932
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:08,415
And two or three days later a plane crash

3933
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:11,231
Alright

3934
03:15:11,743 --> 03:15:16,351
It's been used by white supremacists and white nationalists for years to justify their own desire for a white Athens

3935
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:20,703
Imagine that Nick has some other reason to pull out that quote here

3936
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:23,263
I think it's possibly over simplified

3937
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:27,871
Even if you imagine the worst possible interpretation for someone for something

3938
03:15:28,127 --> 03:15:29,663
That Allie said in an interview

3939
03:15:29,919 --> 03:15:30,943
49 years ago

3940
03:15:31,455 --> 03:15:34,783
I still don't think that's a good defense for Nick's position against interracial marriage

3941
03:15:35,039 --> 03:15:41,183
No you don't understand someone else had a similar position is not strong stuff because

3942
03:15:41,439 --> 03:15:42,463
One person

3943
03:15:42,975 --> 03:15:48,863
Who gained Fame and yet still did not overcome the institutionalized racism

3944
03:15:49,119 --> 03:15:52,191
Was expressing a world you built around white people

3945
03:15:52,447 --> 03:15:55,519
Enslaving everybody he's ever known

3946
03:15:57,823 --> 03:15:58,591
After that f***

3947
03:15:58,847 --> 03:15:59,615
Continuing

3948
03:15:59,871 --> 03:16:05,503
A pattern of abuse for years on passed the civil right there because he was expressing his opinion there

3949
03:16:05,759 --> 03:16:07,551
That totally makes it okay for a white

3950
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:10,367
Did all of that s***

3951
03:16:11,135 --> 03:16:13,183
2 then co-opted his argument

3952
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:19,839
Even if you take it that aside like just the appeal to Authority that's being done is not really in a story

3953
03:16:20,095 --> 03:16:22,143
Just some that's a celebrity

3954
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:27,263
Some interesting ideas about a lot of stuff but that doesn't mean

3955
03:16:27,519 --> 03:16:29,311
A great point

3956
03:16:29,567 --> 03:16:31,615
It look there's there's Muhammad Ali

3957
03:16:31,871 --> 03:16:33,407
And then there's audre Lorde

3958
03:16:33,663 --> 03:16:34,943
And those are the only two

3959
03:16:36,223 --> 03:16:38,527
The point of this where it all started

3960
03:16:38,783 --> 03:16:42,367
Nick Fuentes giving people a reason to suspect he's a racist and a white.

3961
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:44,415
Also there are few things

3962
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:50,815
More satisfying for me then when Alex tries to bring out that stuff but like Elohim City and that the material

3963
03:16:51,327 --> 03:16:55,679
Expecting it to blow people's minds and no one cares

3964
03:16:55,935 --> 03:16:57,471
Splc Rosita

3965
03:16:57,727 --> 03:16:59,263
To try to get white be able to have Bob

3966
03:17:01,311 --> 03:17:02,591
We want to hear neck

3967
03:17:03,103 --> 03:17:06,687
What are you doing there are some there is some serious

3968
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:09,247
Death

3969
03:17:09,503 --> 03:17:10,015
What if

3970
03:17:13,599 --> 03:17:14,111
The name of it

3971
03:17:14,367 --> 03:17:16,927
Always be closing

3972
03:17:19,231 --> 03:17:24,095
What's the name of the movie Glengarry Glen Ross that's what this has such like

3973
03:17:24,607 --> 03:17:25,375
Alexace

3974
03:17:25,631 --> 03:17:26,143
Is Jack Lemmon

3975
03:17:27,423 --> 03:17:28,447
Alex is the drunk

3976
03:17:28,959 --> 03:17:31,007
And Nick Fuentes is the hot young kid

3977
03:17:31,263 --> 03:17:32,799
That's so much

3978
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:34,847
What's going on

3979
03:17:35,103 --> 03:17:40,991
Nick starts talking about the people who are sponsoring seapak

3980
03:17:41,247 --> 03:17:47,391
And how they believe in open borders

3981
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:50,975
People that are putting up the money for their thing

3982
03:17:51,231 --> 03:17:52,767
Putting up the money for their conference

3983
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:55,583
Are benefiting from their open borders agenda so

3984
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:58,655
In conclusion is I was at 5

3985
03:17:59,167 --> 03:18:03,007
True it's not that were against the FurReal puppy life

3986
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:05,823
Xrp weaponize against

3987
03:18:06,335 --> 03:18:08,383
Islamic three times longer

3988
03:18:08,895 --> 03:18:11,967
Selena's will say I Spencer Nick Fuentes I did not

3989
03:18:12,735 --> 03:18:14,015
Isaac syndrome

3990
03:18:14,271 --> 03:18:16,063
They're going to take us out of here in like 30 minutes

3991
03:18:16,575 --> 03:18:17,855
We are like five more speakers

3992
03:18:18,623 --> 03:18:20,671
We just got rid of the whole question answer conference

3993
03:18:21,183 --> 03:18:22,207
But it's good price

3994
03:18:22,463 --> 03:18:25,023
We're not going to get the call

3995
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:26,815
The globalists are weaponizing

3996
03:18:27,071 --> 03:18:27,839
And you're right

3997
03:18:28,863 --> 03:18:31,167
Ben Shapiro and all these people are

3998
03:18:31,423 --> 03:18:32,703
Push by the system

3999
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:34,751
We're banned by the system

4000
03:18:35,007 --> 03:18:36,287
What does that tell you

4001
03:18:43,711 --> 03:18:47,807
They can handle that you got a laugh off of that type

4002
03:18:48,831 --> 03:18:52,415
That motherfuker

4003
03:18:53,951 --> 03:19:00,095
Look at us doing this to maneuver it

4004
03:19:00,863 --> 03:19:01,375
Damn it I hate

4005
03:19:02,143 --> 03:19:03,167
Pretty wild

4006
03:19:03,423 --> 03:19:07,263
Nick speech ends and Alex brings up the next

4007
03:19:07,775 --> 03:19:09,567
He's giving an introduction

4008
03:19:09,823 --> 03:19:10,847
To Gavin McInnes

4009
03:19:12,127 --> 03:19:12,639
And

4010
03:19:12,895 --> 03:19:14,943
You supposed to be the headliner other than Alex

4011
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:17,247
Right

4012
03:19:17,503 --> 03:19:18,271
I got you because

4013
03:19:18,783 --> 03:19:19,295
You know

4014
03:19:19,551 --> 03:19:24,159
According to everything that was already in Alex's head Gavin is the most

4015
03:19:24,415 --> 03:19:25,439
Figure that was there

4016
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:26,975
Before he became it

4017
03:19:27,231 --> 03:19:28,255
He probably thought like

4018
03:19:28,511 --> 03:19:29,023
You know what

4019
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:30,815
Knicks more important than Millie

4020
03:19:31,071 --> 03:19:33,887
More important than the guy who started Vice

4021
03:19:34,143 --> 03:19:35,423
Who's the head of a probe

4022
03:19:35,679 --> 03:19:36,447
And now Nick is lie

4023
03:19:36,703 --> 03:19:37,471
Like Dave Chappelle dropping

4024
03:19:37,727 --> 03:19:39,007
In 45 minutes at the go

4025
03:19:39,263 --> 03:19:39,775
Does 45

4026
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:44,383
And I think Alex realizes this as he's trying to introduce cats

4027
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:45,919
One last thing

4028
03:19:46,175 --> 03:19:47,199
Thesis statement

4029
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:52,831
We as conservatives who are in favor of America first whatever our differences

4030
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:59,487
We will either hang together or we will most surely hang separately That's Amore

4031
03:19:59,743 --> 03:20:05,887
Thank you and now we have gathered together

4032
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:12,287
Can I introduce the Sandia major sensor anybody

4033
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:16,895
Fireball

4034
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:19,711
I think that Alex is really shaken by the fact

4035
03:20:19,967 --> 03:20:21,503
Nick Fuentes you can telephone

4036
03:20:21,759 --> 03:20:22,271
Just listening to this

4037
03:20:22,527 --> 03:20:25,599
Yeah but he got a standing ovation from the crowd after his speech

4038
03:20:26,367 --> 03:20:27,903
Bring up Gavin

4039
03:20:28,159 --> 03:20:30,207
Gavin McInnes

4040
03:20:30,463 --> 03:20:32,511
And the crowd is giving a standing ovation

4041
03:20:33,023 --> 03:20:33,535
4nickk

4042
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:37,119
This is not good for Alex

4043
03:20:37,375 --> 03:20:39,423
Because this flips the dynamic he was hoping

4044
03:20:40,447 --> 03:20:42,239
Alex other people s***

4045
03:20:42,495 --> 03:20:43,519
Because in the fridge weirdo

4046
03:20:43,775 --> 03:20:47,871
Conspiracy and crypto-fascist right-wing he's always been the biggest game in town

4047
03:20:48,383 --> 03:20:49,151
Other people may have some

4048
03:20:49,407 --> 03:20:51,711
Cottage industry additionally Alex

4049
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:54,783
Unable to associate with them and then use them to his advantage

4050
03:20:56,063 --> 03:20:57,087
The exact opposite

4051
03:20:57,855 --> 03:20:59,135
Nick Fuentes does not need our

4052
03:20:59,391 --> 03:21:01,695
Alex and I think Alex realized it in

4053
03:21:02,463 --> 03:21:03,231
Any benefit

4054
03:21:03,487 --> 03:21:05,279
From this is going directly to

4055
03:21:06,047 --> 03:21:08,095
Any person who Alex's exposing to Nick

4056
03:21:08,351 --> 03:21:09,887
Possibly

4057
03:21:10,143 --> 03:21:11,423
Become a fan of Nicks

4058
03:21:11,935 --> 03:21:13,983
It's not going to go the other way around

4059
03:21:14,239 --> 03:21:17,567
It's not like Knicks fans are going to convert to info Warriors

4060
03:21:20,127 --> 03:21:26,271
I strongly suspected Alex realize that he's in a situation where the only outcomes available to him are losing Prospect

4061
03:21:27,295 --> 03:21:32,415
You could fully accept Nick and watches his audience gets drawn away from him to the towards the shiny

4062
03:21:32,671 --> 03:21:33,951
Nice respectable clean

4063
03:21:34,207 --> 03:21:34,975
Cut articulate

4064
03:21:35,231 --> 03:21:36,255
Magnanimous Young Band

4065
03:21:36,511 --> 03:21:38,559
Who can handle himself way way better than ours

4066
03:21:39,327 --> 03:21:40,351
Or conversely

4067
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:42,399
He could try to distance himself from Nick now

4068
03:21:42,655 --> 03:21:44,191
And run the risk of becoming his neck

4069
03:21:44,447 --> 03:21:44,959
Target

4070
03:21:45,215 --> 03:21:49,055
The next example of an organization like turning point that isn't really America first

4071
03:21:49,567 --> 03:21:50,335
But pretends to be

4072
03:21:51,359 --> 03:21:52,383
That q-and-a session

4073
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:53,151
At the end

4074
03:21:53,407 --> 03:21:54,687
Is a huge Danger

4075
03:21:55,199 --> 03:21:58,527
The way that Nathan the groupers have done the damage they have to Turning Point

4076
03:21:59,039 --> 03:21:59,807
Is by showing up at

4077
03:22:00,063 --> 03:22:04,415
In the audience and asking them incredibly loaded questions about Israel

4078
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:06,975
And about restricting even legal immigration

4079
03:22:07,231 --> 03:22:07,743
Country

4080
03:22:07,999 --> 03:22:10,559
It's a stunt strategy that's meant to make Turning Point look

4081
03:22:10,815 --> 03:22:12,095
Unable to answer these questions

4082
03:22:12,351 --> 03:22:16,191
And expose them as they non-conservative Shields Nick says they are

4083
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:16,959
Conservative

4084
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:19,519
It's honestly a really good media strategy

4085
03:22:19,775 --> 03:22:21,055
And it's helped by the fact

4086
03:22:21,567 --> 03:22:23,871
Mentioned mainstream media

4087
03:22:24,127 --> 03:22:25,151
A turning point

4088
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:28,735
We're not going to come to their defense when they're being attacked by a group of crypto-fascist

4089
03:22:29,247 --> 03:22:29,759
Monarchist

4090
03:22:30,527 --> 03:22:33,087
Alex cannot be on the receiving end of that kind of tree

4091
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:34,111
And survive

4092
03:22:34,623 --> 03:22:37,695
He's too drunk at this point to navigate that Q&A session safely

4093
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:41,279
No chance he has no position on his real that sounds principle

4094
03:22:41,535 --> 03:22:45,631
You just says I'm not against it but I bought enough for him

4095
03:22:45,887 --> 03:22:46,655
Israel

4096
03:22:47,167 --> 03:22:50,239
That's going to unveil

4097
03:22:51,007 --> 03:22:57,151
And I think that Alex realizes that when he sees all the

4098
03:22:57,663 --> 03:22:59,199
This event has been co-opted

4099
03:22:59,455 --> 03:23:01,247
Alex is in serious trouble

4100
03:23:02,015 --> 03:23:04,575
Thanks we Gavin is up next and he's a super funny guy

4101
03:23:05,343 --> 03:23:05,855
Gavin open

4102
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:11,231
With a bit of business where he pretends to trip on his way up to the stage and he drops all of his notes he doesn't

4103
03:23:13,023 --> 03:23:13,791
So they're in the right

4104
03:23:14,559 --> 03:23:20,703
His notes are in a disheveled mess when he gets up to pick them up so he starts a nervously reading the last pages if it's the opening

4105
03:23:21,471 --> 03:23:23,519
It's f****** Andy Kaufman level s*** man

4106
03:23:23,775 --> 03:23:24,543
Keith creative

4107
03:23:26,847 --> 03:23:27,615
This alone

4108
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:32,479
Is innovative solo sketch work its game

4109
03:23:32,735 --> 03:23:33,247
It's very good

4110
03:23:33,503 --> 03:23:35,295
Gavin he wasn't done with Justin

4111
03:23:35,551 --> 03:23:36,575
The pratfall and a mister

4112
03:23:37,343 --> 03:23:38,623
I don't know if I can do this

4113
03:23:39,135 --> 03:23:40,415
When my notes got muddled up

4114
03:23:41,183 --> 03:23:41,951
I ended up with the laugh

4115
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:42,719
Last page

4116
03:23:44,511 --> 03:23:46,047
The new hamburger

4117
03:23:46,815 --> 03:23:47,839
What are you doing up there

4118
03:24:16,767 --> 03:24:18,815
Is it a f*****-up how they give away

4119
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:21,375
They're play on a regular basis

4120
03:24:21,887 --> 03:24:28,031
Just so you understand what just went on ahead and come up to and from the crowd and bring him a beer

4121
03:24:30,079 --> 03:24:31,871
Which precedes to snort on stage

4122
03:24:32,895 --> 03:24:33,663
The goal of the B

4123
03:24:33,919 --> 03:24:35,455
Is having pretend to be all nervous

4124
03:24:35,711 --> 03:24:37,759
I'm like Popeye getting a can of spinach

4125
03:24:38,015 --> 03:24:40,575
He transforms into the strong confident South

4126
03:24:40,831 --> 03:24:43,647
I'll take his real self after getting his booze and cocaine

4127
03:24:43,903 --> 03:24:44,927
It, Desi boss

4128
03:24:46,463 --> 03:24:50,559
Kristen Schaal and Kurt braunohler Kristen Schaal

4129
03:24:51,071 --> 03:24:53,631
Christian shows are Steve Austin

4130
03:24:53,887 --> 03:25:00,031
Uncle didn't need the beers to become stone cold

4131
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:01,823
I apologize

4132
03:25:02,079 --> 03:25:02,591
Thibodaux

4133
03:25:02,847 --> 03:25:03,615
Problem with a B

4134
03:25:03,871 --> 03:25:05,151
Is Gavin is doing it is

4135
03:25:05,407 --> 03:25:06,175
How It Ends

4136
03:25:06,687 --> 03:25:12,575
However working in practices that Gavin doesn't really sell the post cocaine boost of energy yeah

4137
03:25:13,087 --> 03:25:16,415
Is underwhelming which is why it is there's a tepid response from the crowd

4138
03:25:16,927 --> 03:25:19,231
And that undercuts the ability of this to work as a jokes

4139
03:25:19,999 --> 03:25:21,791
You got to go bag that's kind of a problem

4140
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:24,351
Because you're pretending to do cocaine to open your side

4141
03:25:24,607 --> 03:25:26,655
You need to be high

4142
03:25:26,911 --> 03:25:27,679
Time

4143
03:25:27,935 --> 03:25:31,263
Rooster basically signal into the audience bailed on it

4144
03:25:32,031 --> 03:25:38,175
Also nothing more conservative than a grumpy former gang leaders who slowly drifting deeper into his openly

4145
03:25:38,431 --> 03:25:40,223
Sad drinking in public phase

4146
03:25:42,783 --> 03:25:48,927
I kind of like a good solid messaging as a as a completely contacts list

4147
03:25:51,487 --> 03:25:51,999
Skullduggery

4148
03:25:52,767 --> 03:25:53,279
Important

4149
03:25:53,535 --> 03:25:54,815
No totals

4150
03:25:55,071 --> 03:26:00,959
On stage

4151
03:26:02,751 --> 03:26:08,895
He's not taking any more holistically and I'm looking at it from the perspective of

4152
03:26:09,151 --> 03:26:09,919
Want to show ya

4153
03:26:10,175 --> 03:26:11,711
Don't do that the B got to work

4154
03:26:14,527 --> 03:26:16,575
Depends got to work you got to commit to it

4155
03:26:17,087 --> 03:26:20,927
You got to commit to it that's that's number one on

4156
03:26:21,183 --> 03:26:26,815
Conceptual but then seconds away that this is so incoherent in Congress to the rest of

4157
03:26:27,327 --> 03:26:29,119
The Vine

4158
03:26:31,423 --> 03:26:32,447
It's a real problem

4159
03:26:38,335 --> 03:26:41,151
Like he started out trying to be a comic to

4160
03:26:42,943 --> 03:26:45,759
Wish my failure

4161
03:26:46,015 --> 03:26:47,551
Add turned into a right-wing Griff

4162
03:26:47,807 --> 03:26:50,623
We all should have made that move

4163
03:26:50,879 --> 03:26:51,391
I know

4164
03:26:51,647 --> 03:26:52,671
Gavin

4165
03:26:52,927 --> 03:26:58,303
Gives up on the whole like cocaine's making me Speedy thing cuz I got no response from the audience

4166
03:26:58,559 --> 03:26:59,583
Campbell

4167
03:27:00,095 --> 03:27:02,399
Just gets into talking about some dumb s***

4168
03:27:02,911 --> 03:27:06,239
This is nothing to do with Trump this has to do with you winning you f****** b*******

4169
03:27:06,495 --> 03:27:07,007
Conte

4170
03:27:10,335 --> 03:27:12,639
When was telling ones I ever saw

4171
03:27:13,151 --> 03:27:16,479
They were Taco drag queen Story Hour in some small town

4172
03:27:16,991 --> 03:27:18,527
And the teacher said

4173
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:20,575
Teacher who organized this thing

4174
03:27:21,343 --> 03:27:21,855
Said

4175
03:27:22,623 --> 03:27:23,391
Let's be honest

4176
03:27:23,647 --> 03:27:26,207
Parents often don't know what's best for their kids

4177
03:27:26,975 --> 03:27:27,999
Delta Community

4178
03:27:28,255 --> 03:27:28,767
Should decide

4179
03:27:29,279 --> 03:27:30,303
What's Bachelor kid

4180
03:27:31,071 --> 03:27:32,607
Anyway

4181
03:27:33,375 --> 03:27:34,655
I caught you looking

4182
03:27:35,167 --> 03:27:36,959
I see what you really about there

4183
03:27:37,215 --> 03:27:40,799
Examples of

4184
03:27:41,311 --> 03:27:43,615
Everything I can tell I don't know what kind of app

4185
03:27:43,871 --> 03:27:48,223
Apocryphal story

4186
03:27:48,479 --> 03:27:50,015
Misrepresented

4187
03:27:51,039 --> 03:27:54,367
From what I can tell this is but a state representative in Missouri proposing

4188
03:27:54,623 --> 03:27:58,207
The creation of a parental Library review

4189
03:27:58,463 --> 03:27:59,743
Adult community

4190
03:28:00,767 --> 03:28:05,375
The goal of the board to be to quote determine whether any sexual material provided to the public

4191
03:28:05,631 --> 03:28:07,167
By the public library is a

4192
03:28:07,423 --> 03:28:07,935
Appropriate

4193
03:28:08,703 --> 03:28:14,847
According to most people who spoke about this bill from the director of the American Library association's office for intellectual freedom

4194
03:28:15,103 --> 03:28:17,151
Do various drag queen Story Hour participants

4195
03:28:17,407 --> 03:28:18,687
This is actually in the temperature

4196
03:28:18,943 --> 03:28:22,783
Tail free speech in public libraries and oppose potentially harsh fine

4197
03:28:23,039 --> 03:28:28,415
Leaving jail time on Library libraries host events

4198
03:28:28,671 --> 03:28:29,695
But he's actually caught

4199
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:30,719
Constitutionally protect

4200
03:28:30,975 --> 03:28:37,119
Yeah liberals want the community side and all conservatives want is for 5 people to decide a mobile

4201
03:28:37,375 --> 03:28:42,751
The most recent most relevant example of the community deciding

4202
03:28:44,031 --> 03:28:44,543
Clearly

4203
03:28:44,799 --> 03:28:46,847
An attempt to push back on

4204
03:28:47,103 --> 03:28:48,127
Drag queen Story Hour

4205
03:28:48,383 --> 03:28:50,175
If there's one thing I know about history is that

4206
03:28:51,455 --> 03:28:52,223
People who burned

4207
03:28:52,991 --> 03:28:53,503
Sure

4208
03:28:53,759 --> 03:28:58,111
Secure this is the veneer of being something where the community takes over and decide what's good for you

4209
03:28:58,367 --> 03:29:03,231
Your kid but in practice it's yet another attempt to do away with drag queen Story Hour through the process of

4210
03:29:03,487 --> 03:29:04,255
Community review board

4211
03:29:05,023 --> 03:29:06,303
Devin should be in favor this

4212
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:08,095
Since it works towards his goal

4213
03:29:08,607 --> 03:29:10,399
32 much of a reactionary snowflake

4214
03:29:10,655 --> 03:29:14,239
Like so he hears the word Community down a pre-scripted

4215
03:29:14,495 --> 03:29:15,007
Feigned outrage

4216
03:29:15,263 --> 03:29:17,567
There's a bit of this and that's in this

4217
03:29:17,823 --> 03:29:20,383
It's not. It's just like when Alex was

4218
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:21,919
Bitching about

4219
03:29:22,175 --> 03:29:23,199
Built bars

4220
03:29:23,711 --> 03:29:27,551
Lino Scott that's what you're supposed to want

4221
03:29:27,807 --> 03:29:33,951
That's why he wants too stupid to even know what you want

4222
03:29:34,207 --> 03:29:36,767
Nevermind

4223
03:29:37,023 --> 03:29:37,535
My bad

4224
03:29:38,047 --> 03:29:40,863
This is the propaganda Angela I'm just dumb

4225
03:29:44,959 --> 03:29:45,471
Avenza

4226
03:29:47,007 --> 03:29:49,311
Jokes free speech

4227
03:29:49,567 --> 03:29:52,639
The agenda is clearly I want to control the story

4228
03:29:53,663 --> 03:29:54,175
And

4229
03:29:54,943 --> 03:29:55,711
When you see the

4230
03:29:55,967 --> 03:29:57,247
People being persecuted

4231
03:29:58,015 --> 03:30:01,599
In this day and age it tends to be and this might be the coke talking

4232
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:05,695
Because they're Charming

4233
03:30:05,951 --> 03:30:06,975
And funny and Gorge

4234
03:30:07,999 --> 03:30:08,511
Like me

4235
03:30:10,303 --> 03:30:11,839
That is

4236
03:30:16,191 --> 03:30:17,727
But he's supposed to be a former comic

4237
03:30:19,775 --> 03:30:20,543
No

4238
03:30:21,823 --> 03:30:23,103
He started the proud boys

4239
03:30:24,639 --> 03:30:25,919
The gang proud boys

4240
03:30:26,431 --> 03:30:26,943
Jewel of

4241
03:30:27,711 --> 03:30:28,735
The proud boys

4242
03:30:29,503 --> 03:30:31,807
Anyway the man

4243
03:30:32,319 --> 03:30:34,111
Can be silent much like the audiences for him

4244
03:30:34,623 --> 03:30:40,255
The man hates the proud boys and they're mad at

4245
03:30:40,511 --> 03:30:42,559
We ought we hate all my

4246
03:30:42,815 --> 03:30:44,607
Is there a violin

4247
03:30:45,119 --> 03:30:46,143
We're against violent gangs

4248
03:30:46,399 --> 03:30:52,543
No Brinkley were against nonviolent games like the like the f****** people who love the Insane Clown Posse

4249
03:30:52,799 --> 03:30:54,591
I like

4250
03:30:54,847 --> 03:30:59,199
You make interesting point that's not why

4251
03:31:03,807 --> 03:31:06,111
Started this club The Proud boys

4252
03:31:07,135 --> 03:31:09,183
As a fun silly men's club

4253
03:31:09,695 --> 03:31:10,463
Still is

4254
03:31:11,231 --> 03:31:11,999
And

4255
03:31:12,767 --> 03:31:15,839
I think the last saw that is making Trump cool

4256
03:31:16,095 --> 03:31:17,375
Making conservatism cool

4257
03:31:17,631 --> 03:31:18,655
But more importantly

4258
03:31:19,167 --> 03:31:20,447
Issuing Shane

4259
03:31:21,471 --> 03:31:26,847
I can't imagine the level of self-delusion that's required to think that the proud boys made support and trouble of cool

4260
03:31:27,359 --> 03:31:29,919
Is a group of matching shirts is group

4261
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:32,223
Is named a song in The Aladdin musical

4262
03:31:35,807 --> 03:31:36,831
Merced

4263
03:31:37,343 --> 03:31:39,135
Assuring shame thing

4264
03:31:39,391 --> 03:31:45,023
How do we square that with the basic requirement for proud boy membership being there to stop masturbating

4265
03:31:45,535 --> 03:31:51,679
I can't think of anything that's more screams of deep shame complexes than a weirdo failed comedian

4266
03:31:51,935 --> 03:31:53,471
3-gang of disaffected young men

4267
03:31:53,727 --> 03:31:59,871
Did they have to stop jerking off to join him

4268
03:32:00,127 --> 03:32:06,271
Feeling shame

4269
03:32:06,527 --> 03:32:07,295
Word around with us

4270
03:32:07,551 --> 03:32:09,599
Do you like the desert

4271
03:32:09,855 --> 03:32:15,487
The social benefits that are come from generations of denying minorities access to the economy or any semblance of Social Power

4272
03:32:15,743 --> 03:32:19,839
The point is that white people shouldn't have to feel bad about the racist history of our country but

4273
03:32:20,351 --> 03:32:25,983
I think the Shamy really should be focusing on is him telling them dudes that if they want to be in his group that can't beat off

4274
03:32:26,495 --> 03:32:32,639
Psychologically that's a way more interesting thing that is run-of-the-mill white identity leanings

4275
03:32:32,895 --> 03:32:36,223
Any famous psychiatrist to say that there is a lot of Deep

4276
03:32:36,479 --> 03:32:38,271
S*** going on behind people saying don't mess

4277
03:32:38,527 --> 03:32:40,831
I can't think of any

4278
03:32:41,087 --> 03:32:43,647
Really really famous psychiatry

4279
03:32:43,903 --> 03:32:44,415
It's weird

4280
03:32:44,671 --> 03:32:45,183
That

4281
03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:50,815
Kevin's complaining about how like a we should be focusing on Muslims cuz they're all terrorists

4282
03:32:51,071 --> 03:32:54,911
I hate gays

4283
03:32:55,423 --> 03:32:56,191
Did the last

4284
03:32:56,447 --> 03:32:56,959
And the globalist

4285
03:32:57,215 --> 03:32:59,519
Stan the Man they just want to demonize a redneck

4286
03:32:59,775 --> 03:33:00,799
That's what they want to do

4287
03:33:01,055 --> 03:33:02,335
Oki Mendes Falls

4288
03:33:02,591 --> 03:33:03,103
Apart

4289
03:33:03,615 --> 03:33:05,151
They want a redneck

4290
03:33:05,663 --> 03:33:07,199
He live in some bizarre

4291
03:33:07,455 --> 03:33:09,503
Fantasy world some shity movie

4292
03:33:10,015 --> 03:33:10,783
On Showtime

4293
03:33:11,551 --> 03:33:12,063
Oblivious

4294
03:33:13,343 --> 03:33:16,927
You assholes stop chatting your f****** head off please there we go

4295
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:19,999
Hey shifter brains talking to Nick

4296
03:33:20,767 --> 03:33:21,279
Hey

4297
03:33:21,535 --> 03:33:23,839
You f****** limey s*** forebrain

4298
03:33:25,887 --> 03:33:28,703
If you want to chat go outside what are you doing here

4299
03:33:30,495 --> 03:33:32,799
Sounds like a swarm of bees nattering over there

4300
03:33:33,823 --> 03:33:35,103
Oh that's a fail comedian

4301
03:33:35,871 --> 03:33:42,015
Isley shut the fuk up

4302
03:33:42,271 --> 03:33:43,807
I've looked at this is gone

4303
03:33:44,319 --> 03:33:46,367
You guys shut up

4304
03:33:47,391 --> 03:33:53,535
This obviously wants to be funny but he's also a super super angry

4305
03:33:53,791 --> 03:33:55,071
Dude which is a combination that

4306
03:33:55,327 --> 03:33:57,631
Very few people can pull off

4307
03:33:57,887 --> 03:33:58,655
Depalo and

4308
03:33:58,911 --> 03:34:04,031
He did for 20 years in the late 80s

4309
03:34:04,543 --> 03:34:10,687
Kevin Spencer time onstage Ramblin his way through a convoluted story but haven't actually the victims of all the streets

4310
03:34:10,943 --> 03:34:11,967
B they've gotten into

4311
03:34:12,223 --> 03:34:16,319
Of courts are full of sjw judges and how he hopes and teeth people get raped

4312
03:34:16,575 --> 03:34:19,391
Imprisoned

4313
03:34:20,159 --> 03:34:20,671
I'm not a

4314
03:34:20,927 --> 03:34:22,463
It's horrible and

4315
03:34:22,975 --> 03:34:25,535
Very difficult to follow as a speech

4316
03:34:26,303 --> 03:34:29,119
Punctuated by increasingly sat attempts at punchlines

4317
03:34:29,631 --> 03:34:33,727
More so than anyone else who's come on stage so far given really does think he's funny

4318
03:34:34,239 --> 03:34:37,311
Either failed stand-up comics I think he thinks he's got some of those skills

4319
03:34:37,567 --> 03:34:39,103
Still but man he does

4320
03:34:39,871 --> 03:34:41,663
Eclipse of the speech for a couple

4321
03:34:42,943 --> 03:34:44,479
The first is that it's almost in comprehend

4322
03:34:44,991 --> 03:34:48,575
And the stuff that he sang his gang members are things that I couldn't possibly

4323
03:34:48,831 --> 03:34:49,855
Confirm or deny if I wanted

4324
03:34:50,623 --> 03:34:56,767
Things like jailhouse conversations a proud boy allegedly had with an antifa member

4325
03:34:57,023 --> 03:34:57,791
Retainer

4326
03:34:58,047 --> 03:35:00,095
I don't believe that but also there's nothing I can do with

4327
03:35:00,863 --> 03:35:03,935
The other reason to Gavin do the reason I don't want to

4328
03:35:04,191 --> 03:35:07,007
Talk about this all that much more is that Kevin is trying to be funny

4329
03:35:07,519 --> 03:35:13,663
Any style of Comedy is basically just saying offensive things and then basking in the orgasmic glow edgy enough to save

4330
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:14,687
Is bad word

4331
03:35:15,199 --> 03:35:16,223
Very lame and sad

4332
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:17,759
Lucky thinks he's Lenny Bruce

4333
03:35:18,015 --> 03:35:19,039
Because you said the t word

4334
03:35:19,295 --> 03:35:20,575
In a room full of the most

4335
03:35:21,087 --> 03:35:22,879
People you could ever gather together

4336
03:35:23,391 --> 03:35:26,975
It's really the definition of someone doing an impression what they think a g looks like

4337
03:35:27,231 --> 03:35:29,023
While doing the safest thing imagine

4338
03:35:29,535 --> 03:35:31,327
Which in many ways is an apt description

4339
03:35:32,095 --> 03:35:38,239
This entire summer

4340
03:35:40,543 --> 03:35:46,175
Heard Alexandra

4341
03:35:46,431 --> 03:35:47,199
A two-man game now

4342
03:35:47,711 --> 03:35:51,039
No actually he's

4343
03:35:51,295 --> 03:35:52,831
And then robbed

4344
03:35:53,855 --> 03:35:56,927
Demonym for Gavin Miguel

4345
03:35:57,183 --> 03:36:03,327
Yeah yeah

4346
03:36:05,119 --> 03:36:05,631
Tiana

4347
03:36:08,703 --> 03:36:11,775
The only thing I don't like about Gavin McGinnis that drink Budweiser

4348
03:36:16,895 --> 03:36:19,199
I should point out by this point Rob is wasted

4349
03:36:19,455 --> 03:36:20,735
He's very clearly

4350
03:36:23,039 --> 03:36:23,551
Alright

4351
03:36:24,831 --> 03:36:25,599
Well

4352
03:36:26,879 --> 03:36:30,207
The reason I'm up here is cuz Alex Jones has gone to bed

4353
03:36:30,975 --> 03:36:34,815
At least heard

4354
03:36:35,327 --> 03:36:36,863
I should have Alex Jones

4355
03:36:37,119 --> 03:36:38,143
Throughout the night

4356
03:36:38,655 --> 03:36:43,007
Please keep in mind that Alex introduced Gavin before the speech

4357
03:36:44,031 --> 03:36:45,823
Interrupted in the middle line

4358
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:48,383
5 minutes

4359
03:36:48,639 --> 03:36:51,199
Since the audience has seen Alex on stage

4360
03:36:51,711 --> 03:36:52,735
Some point

4361
03:36:53,503 --> 03:36:55,807
That and now Alex is going to bed

4362
03:36:56,063 --> 03:36:56,831
I can only think of

4363
03:36:57,087 --> 03:36:58,111
Three possibilities

4364
03:36:58,367 --> 03:37:04,511
For what happened to rank them out from SRA

4365
03:37:05,791 --> 03:37:06,303
Least likely

4366
03:37:06,559 --> 03:37:08,095
Alex legit passed out drunk

4367
03:37:08,351 --> 03:37:09,119
Yes he was

4368
03:37:09,375 --> 03:37:13,471
And I don't think it's impossible but I see This is highly unlikely

4369
03:37:13,727 --> 03:37:16,799
I seen many episodes are Alex's three sheets to the wind

4370
03:37:17,055 --> 03:37:17,567
It's bedtime

4371
03:37:17,823 --> 03:37:18,591
But he keeps going

4372
03:37:19,103 --> 03:37:21,407
Alex gets drunk because a lot of staying power

4373
03:37:21,919 --> 03:37:26,015
He's a guy who won't leave your party at 4 a.m. and everyone else is already gone home

4374
03:37:26,271 --> 03:37:27,039
Free the fury about

4375
03:37:27,295 --> 03:37:30,367
Gremlins being predictive programming that you have to listen to

4376
03:37:30,623 --> 03:37:32,159
He's that he's that guy

4377
03:37:32,415 --> 03:37:33,183
I respect you

4378
03:37:33,439 --> 03:37:33,951
Stamina

4379
03:37:34,207 --> 03:37:34,975
And I do

4380
03:37:35,231 --> 03:37:36,767
Want to hear what you have to say

4381
03:37:37,023 --> 03:37:38,047
Months from now

4382
03:37:38,303 --> 03:37:38,815
Please leave my

4383
03:37:39,071 --> 03:37:41,375
He doesn't go down please leave my home

4384
03:37:41,631 --> 03:37:42,399
Medium likely

4385
03:37:42,655 --> 03:37:44,959
Someone enforce probably Owens

4386
03:37:45,215 --> 03:37:45,983
Robbed

4387
03:37:46,239 --> 03:37:47,007
We f***** up to

4388
03:37:47,263 --> 03:37:49,311
Told Alex that he needed to call it a night

4389
03:37:49,823 --> 03:37:53,407
He was at a point where something could cause real damage

4390
03:37:53,663 --> 03:37:56,735
And the fact that Mike slim Junior showing up plus Nick Fuentes

4391
03:37:56,991 --> 03:38:00,063
It may have given the streams a bit more attention than they would have gotten otherwise

4392
03:38:00,831 --> 03:38:03,903
I see this is kind of possible that someone would have stopped Alex

4393
03:38:04,159 --> 03:38:06,719
From hurting himself by giving his headlining speech

4394
03:38:07,487 --> 03:38:07,999
Disaster

4395
03:38:08,255 --> 03:38:09,791
I also don't think that it's a

4396
03:38:10,047 --> 03:38:10,559
Sure thing

4397
03:38:10,815 --> 03:38:11,583
Because Alex

4398
03:38:11,839 --> 03:38:13,119
Particularly drunk

4399
03:38:13,375 --> 03:38:14,399
Doesn't listen to other

4400
03:38:14,911 --> 03:38:15,935
He's very stubborn

4401
03:38:16,447 --> 03:38:20,287
And I feel like he's the kind of guy who'd fight a bartender tried to cut him off Alex

4402
03:38:20,543 --> 03:38:21,055
But listen

4403
03:38:21,567 --> 03:38:24,895
Look I think your speech is great but you spent the first 50

4404
03:38:25,151 --> 03:38:25,919
18 minutes of it

4405
03:38:26,175 --> 03:38:32,319
Arguing why the hard-r is the only problem with you saying the n-word so I mean how about saying it was a bad

4406
03:38:32,575 --> 03:38:33,855
Now I know

4407
03:38:34,367 --> 03:38:35,647
Like no I know

4408
03:38:35,903 --> 03:38:37,951
I know and look this song

4409
03:38:38,207 --> 03:38:41,023
I agree but just going to

4410
03:38:41,279 --> 03:38:41,791
Just go to bed

4411
03:38:42,047 --> 03:38:43,071
So most likely

4412
03:38:44,095 --> 03:38:44,863
Alex nudity

4413
03:38:45,119 --> 03:38:45,887
He couldn't give a speech

4414
03:38:46,143 --> 03:38:46,655
Wasted

4415
03:38:46,911 --> 03:38:47,935
In front of Nick Fuentes

4416
03:38:49,215 --> 03:38:50,751
The only possible outcome is trouble

4417
03:38:51,263 --> 03:38:57,407
They're super conservative and their ideas are largely based on a lot of the same Aunty left conspiracy bulshit that's grown out of the red

4418
03:38:57,663 --> 03:39:02,271
Remnants of the Cold War

4419
03:39:03,295 --> 03:39:06,623
Nick Fuentes is involved in something and aspires to be a political movement

4420
03:39:06,879 --> 03:39:09,951
Not just an entertainment Empire where you can lie about headlines

4421
03:39:10,207 --> 03:39:10,975
Giselle dumb pill

4422
03:39:11,743 --> 03:39:12,511
And his followers

4423
03:39:12,767 --> 03:39:14,559
Have a bit of the same seriousness stupid

4424
03:39:14,815 --> 03:39:16,863
Which is something Alex cannot engage with

4425
03:39:17,631 --> 03:39:18,655
He can engage

4426
03:39:18,911 --> 03:39:20,191
Just not any form of opposition

4427
03:39:20,447 --> 03:39:20,959
From the left

4428
03:39:21,215 --> 03:39:22,751
Because he can just yell over them

4429
03:39:23,007 --> 03:39:24,543
Call them Satanist in

4430
03:39:24,799 --> 03:39:27,359
If all else fails y'all something about how Epstein didn't kill himself

4431
03:39:28,383 --> 03:39:30,943
He cannot risk being attacked from The Fringe right

4432
03:39:31,199 --> 03:39:32,991
Because if he does his whole act Falls

4433
03:39:33,247 --> 03:39:33,759
All the park

4434
03:39:34,015 --> 03:39:40,159
If he's grouper start asking him for his positions on issues they care most about namely is real and shutting down all in

4435
03:39:40,415 --> 03:39:43,231
Immigration Alex is going to look like not a real conservative

4436
03:39:43,743 --> 03:39:46,303
And guess what when that happened none of his tricks

4437
03:39:46,559 --> 03:39:47,071
Twerk

4438
03:39:47,327 --> 03:39:50,143
You can't paint them as Satanist cuz their America First conservative

4439
03:39:50,655 --> 03:39:55,007
He can't take our secret globalists cuz Nick been banned from YouTube and is a target of the media in

4440
03:39:55,263 --> 03:39:56,799
He can't yell at them

4441
03:39:57,055 --> 03:40:01,151
Because that just makes him look weak in contrast to The Smiling Poise Nick Fuentes

4442
03:40:01,663 --> 03:40:04,223
You can't throw his Epstein didn't kill himself smoked

4443
03:40:04,479 --> 03:40:06,015
Because they'll just be like totally agree

4444
03:40:06,271 --> 03:40:07,807
So why shouldn't we attack is

4445
03:40:08,831 --> 03:40:10,367
Nick Fuentes

4446
03:40:10,623 --> 03:40:12,671
The biggest threat to Alex's credibility right now

4447
03:40:13,183 --> 03:40:16,255
And I think rather than mixing it up with them in a livestream he decide

4448
03:40:16,511 --> 03:40:17,023
Let's go to bed

4449
03:40:17,791 --> 03:40:18,559
It's the right decision

4450
03:40:18,815 --> 03:40:20,095
Because Alex doesn't need to be there

4451
03:40:20,607 --> 03:40:24,191
Mass out of himself trying to make the show entertaining and that was a failure

4452
03:40:24,447 --> 03:40:28,031
But they don't need him dragging it out at the end with a dumb speech about his

4453
03:40:28,287 --> 03:40:30,335
Crying about the military junta

4454
03:40:30,591 --> 03:40:31,871
He seems to want to install

4455
03:40:32,383 --> 03:40:35,711
He has Owen Shroyer their seemingly sober is like

4456
03:40:36,223 --> 03:40:38,527
So he's not going to get the same kind of scrutiny that Alex

4457
03:40:39,295 --> 03:40:41,087
He has robbed you completely drunk

4458
03:40:41,343 --> 03:40:42,367
Keep an eye on things

4459
03:40:42,623 --> 03:40:43,647
He was right to go to bed

4460
03:40:44,159 --> 03:40:47,743
Even if they said like 20 times who's going to be the headline speaker and then he just disappeared

4461
03:40:48,255 --> 03:40:50,303
Kind of but I think it's the right decision

4462
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:52,351
Is strategically

4463
03:40:52,863 --> 03:40:54,911
Absolutely

4464
03:40:55,167 --> 03:40:58,239
Charlie Kirk if you missed that one

4465
03:41:00,543 --> 03:41:03,103
Regardless of whether or not Nick Fuentes is there

4466
03:41:03,359 --> 03:41:03,871
That's all

4467
03:41:04,127 --> 03:41:05,151
Going to bed is a good idea

4468
03:41:05,407 --> 03:41:06,431
Well certainly

4469
03:41:06,687 --> 03:41:11,295
But when you head back

4470
03:41:11,551 --> 03:41:13,855
You can also only end up alienating

4471
03:41:14,367 --> 03:41:16,159
A block that you want called

4472
03:41:16,671 --> 03:41:17,951
5 years ago

4473
03:41:18,463 --> 03:41:19,487
This rally

4474
03:41:19,743 --> 03:41:20,767
Is 1

4475
03:41:21,279 --> 03:41:21,791
Filled to the brim

4476
03:41:22,815 --> 03:41:25,119
And to Alex can get s***-faced

4477
03:41:25,375 --> 03:41:26,655
And rambled nonsense

4478
03:41:26,911 --> 03:41:27,679
To close out for

4479
03:41:27,935 --> 03:41:28,447
For 20 minutes

4480
03:41:28,959 --> 03:41:30,495
And everybody's just going to Hoot and Holler

4481
03:41:31,007 --> 03:41:31,519
And have a great time

4482
03:41:31,775 --> 03:41:32,287
Maybe

4483
03:41:32,543 --> 03:41:33,567
Can't pull that off

4484
03:41:33,823 --> 03:41:34,847
Certainly not with

4485
03:41:35,103 --> 03:41:35,615
Nick Fuentes

4486
03:41:35,871 --> 03:41:36,895
The fucken

4487
03:41:37,663 --> 03:41:38,431
Horsemen of the

4488
03:41:38,687 --> 03:41:39,199
Apocalypse

4489
03:41:39,455 --> 03:41:39,967
Find him

4490
03:41:40,223 --> 03:41:41,759
So now that Alex is gone

4491
03:41:42,015 --> 03:41:43,039
That takes away

4492
03:41:43,295 --> 03:41:44,319
A block of time

4493
03:41:44,575 --> 03:41:47,647
Yeah so what are they going to do with the collar

4494
03:41:47,903 --> 03:41:51,743
Hellyeah is now introducing the

4495
03:41:51,999 --> 03:41:53,535
Pull up on stage

4496
03:41:53,791 --> 03:41:55,071
Nick Fuentes get up here

4497
03:41:57,887 --> 03:41:59,423
I have a gift for Nick Fuentes

4498
03:41:59,679 --> 03:42:00,959
I know he's going to love this

4499
03:42:01,215 --> 03:42:02,495
About to get a videotape this cuz

4500
03:42:07,103 --> 03:42:07,615
Alaric

4501
03:42:07,871 --> 03:42:08,383
Nick

4502
03:42:08,639 --> 03:42:11,455
I'm going to present you this pain I want you to tell everybody what it says

4503
03:42:11,711 --> 03:42:12,223
Is your gift

4504
03:42:14,527 --> 03:42:16,575
Zionism is a badge of honor

4505
03:42:16,831 --> 03:42:18,879
Opposite

4506
03:42:20,927 --> 03:42:26,559
Alright you like that

4507
03:42:30,143 --> 03:42:33,983
Aggressively a Zionist

4508
03:42:34,239 --> 03:42:39,103
But he's fine like 82 Factory

4509
03:42:39,359 --> 03:42:41,407
So it's it's a it's kind of a safe

4510
03:42:47,295 --> 03:42:49,087
June 8th doesn't really kick off

4511
03:42:49,343 --> 03:42:51,647
Immediately because there's a lot of disorganization

4512
03:42:52,927 --> 03:42:55,231
And other people coming up on stage and like

4513
03:42:55,487 --> 03:42:56,511
Leaning into the mic

4514
03:42:57,023 --> 03:43:03,167
Answer Lee Stranahan who still there

4515
03:43:03,423 --> 03:43:07,007
Besides this a little something into the mic and then Shroyer

4516
03:43:08,287 --> 03:43:11,103
You missed on a joke earlier so try that again

4517
03:43:11,359 --> 03:43:12,639
I'm just going to say this

4518
03:43:13,151 --> 03:43:17,247
Just do it look fabulous or not look at the pocket square look at mattresses

4519
03:43:18,783 --> 03:43:19,807
I'm at Solon

4520
03:43:20,575 --> 03:43:21,343
You look fantastic

4521
03:43:22,367 --> 03:43:25,695
Just don't tell Rodger Stone I forgot my belt at home today

4522
03:43:25,951 --> 03:43:27,743
He'll take me off the best wrestling

4523
03:43:28,511 --> 03:43:29,791
We have the bikes working are we good

4524
03:43:30,047 --> 03:43:32,863
That joke again it doesn't work again

4525
03:43:33,119 --> 03:43:34,143
Great

4526
03:43:35,935 --> 03:43:36,447
In his

4527
03:43:36,959 --> 03:43:37,471
You know

4528
03:43:37,983 --> 03:43:40,799
Comparatively very level-headed

4529
03:43:41,055 --> 03:43:42,079
Authority position

4530
03:43:42,335 --> 03:43:43,359
Now he takes over

4531
03:43:43,871 --> 03:43:44,895
He's running the q-and-a

4532
03:43:45,151 --> 03:43:48,479
Okay and so it is much more competent hands

4533
03:43:48,735 --> 03:43:50,783
But it's exactly what you'd expect

4534
03:43:51,039 --> 03:43:53,343
Most of the audience is Nick Fuentes

4535
03:43:53,599 --> 03:43:56,671
Cancel their forwards

4536
03:43:57,439 --> 03:43:58,719
I go ahead yeah go ahead

4537
03:43:58,975 --> 03:44:00,767
Traffic question for mr. Fuentes

4538
03:44:01,023 --> 03:44:02,047
So

4539
03:44:02,303 --> 03:44:05,631
As he knows I have two deer tick

4540
03:44:05,887 --> 03:44:07,935
A few months ago and never got a response

4541
03:44:08,447 --> 03:44:12,031
I would like to give mr. French as the leader of the America first movement

4542
03:44:12,287 --> 03:44:14,847
An opportunity to answer my question adequately

4543
03:44:15,359 --> 03:44:21,247
What is the America First Position I'm giving Israel 3.8 billion dollars in Aid every year

4544
03:44:21,503 --> 03:44:23,295
And how is that in America's interest

4545
03:44:24,319 --> 03:44:29,951
Well yeah that's a softball question but I appreciate it, Alexander

4546
03:44:30,463 --> 03:44:36,607
Epic by the way the man who arguably started it all in Colorado

4547
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:40,447
Without question

4548
03:44:40,703 --> 03:44:42,751
So the person asking the question is a plant

4549
03:44:43,007 --> 03:44:44,031
Nxbrew

4550
03:44:44,287 --> 03:44:45,055
Alex

4551
03:44:46,079 --> 03:44:47,359
Know how it's being asked

4552
03:44:47,615 --> 03:44:50,431
What is the America first position on Aid to Israel

4553
03:44:50,943 --> 03:44:56,319
He would waffle Oregon

4554
03:44:56,575 --> 03:44:59,903
He wouldn't come off

4555
03:45:00,159 --> 03:45:05,279
I think he is reelz a good basic we should have being juice orders Jerusalem

4556
03:45:05,535 --> 03:45:08,607
And you wouldn't come off any better than people like Charlie Kirk

4557
03:45:08,863 --> 03:45:10,399
There are two the eyes of these

4558
03:45:10,655 --> 03:45:11,423
America

4559
03:45:11,679 --> 03:45:13,215
The first

4560
03:45:13,471 --> 03:45:14,495
Right

4561
03:45:14,751 --> 03:45:16,031
Immediately from the fur

4562
03:45:16,287 --> 03:45:17,311
First question you see like

4563
03:45:17,823 --> 03:45:19,103
This would have been a f******

4564
03:45:19,359 --> 03:45:20,895
Disaster for Alex call Alex

4565
03:45:21,151 --> 03:45:24,735
Finally he's taken my advice

4566
03:45:27,551 --> 03:45:30,367
Like I said it's disorganized as hell trying to do this

4567
03:45:32,927 --> 03:45:34,975
You know people can just bum rush

4568
03:45:38,047 --> 03:45:44,191
Jerome Bell am running for congress in a second district Virginia

4569
03:45:44,447 --> 03:45:50,591
I need to do first of all we need to get Donald Trump elected again

4570
03:45:50,847 --> 03:45:53,151
In the United States need to take over jinya

4571
03:45:53,407 --> 03:45:55,455
I'll take note Virginia from a Democrat

4572
03:45:55,711 --> 03:45:57,503
From the Democrat Elaine Lauria

4573
03:45:57,759 --> 03:45:59,807
Okay she's almost there

4574
03:46:00,063 --> 03:46:02,367
I just a POS I'll be nice tonight okay

4575
03:46:02,623 --> 03:46:03,135
Bobby nice

4576
03:46:03,391 --> 03:46:05,183
Hey you to ask you a question about

4577
03:46:05,439 --> 03:46:07,743
About 0.8 0.8

4578
03:46:07,999 --> 03:46:10,815
America

4579
03:46:11,071 --> 03:46:17,215
Goddamn what is a Congressional Campaign

4580
03:46:17,471 --> 03:46:19,519
Is running for the house in Virginia 2nd District

4581
03:46:19,775 --> 03:46:23,103
Republicans will be competing

4582
03:46:23,359 --> 03:46:24,639
Primary in June

4583
03:46:24,895 --> 03:46:31,039
If I had to put a bet on it I don't think that was winning that thing remember the house in

4584
03:46:31,295 --> 03:46:32,319
Former Virginia delegate

4585
03:46:32,575 --> 03:46:34,879
Those things look pretty good on a resume and a geode

4586
03:46:35,135 --> 03:46:35,903
Few primary

4587
03:46:36,159 --> 03:46:38,975
See things how things go I should be clear though

4588
03:46:39,487 --> 03:46:41,791
This election is not happening until 2021

4589
03:46:42,303 --> 03:46:43,071
This dude

4590
03:46:43,327 --> 03:46:46,911
Is bum rushing this Q&A session

4591
03:46:47,167 --> 03:46:53,311
Should take notes good for it good for him yeah he's going to make that 90-day living

4592
03:46:53,567 --> 03:46:54,847
Really

4593
03:46:55,103 --> 03:46:59,199
So Jerome Bell answered the candidates questionnaire for ballotpedia about something

4594
03:46:59,455 --> 03:47:00,223
Position

4595
03:47:00,735 --> 03:47:04,575
These answers someone seemed a little bit of weird

4596
03:47:04,831 --> 03:47:09,695
Free first job was as answer was working for the ident division for the FBI

4597
03:47:09,951 --> 03:47:14,047
Papa loves his first-ever job strange

4598
03:47:16,607 --> 03:47:19,423
Anyway Bell is a hard-line anti-immigrant

4599
03:47:19,935 --> 03:47:21,471
He's just he's received some

4600
03:47:21,727 --> 03:47:24,799
Support from the white nationalist circles including faith

4601
03:47:25,311 --> 03:47:30,175
He's running on a platform of shutting down all immigration to the United States which is a very dumb idea

4602
03:47:30,687 --> 03:47:36,831
Apparently based on this site dropping speech he's also in favor of stopping

4603
03:47:37,087 --> 03:47:39,135
The deaths of millions of people around the world

4604
03:47:39,647 --> 03:47:43,999
This Ron Paul ass endorsement of passive Slaughter under the guise of

4605
03:47:44,511 --> 03:47:45,279
It's the stuff of monsters

4606
03:47:46,815 --> 03:47:47,839
Constructed fiscal argument

4607
03:47:48,607 --> 03:47:51,679
I would bet everything I own he's going to lose that primary

4608
03:47:51,935 --> 03:47:56,031
If you're keeping score that's about 20 46 on the Congressional hopefuls

4609
03:47:56,287 --> 03:47:58,847
Alex's head on this absurd rally

4610
03:48:00,127 --> 03:48:01,663
So we get back to the q-and-a

4611
03:48:01,919 --> 03:48:02,431
Do you know

4612
03:48:02,687 --> 03:48:04,479
It's another Nick Fuentes fan

4613
03:48:04,735 --> 03:48:06,783
Asking a softball question to Nick

4614
03:48:07,039 --> 03:48:09,599
Doesn't help us win the culture War that's the question

4615
03:48:09,855 --> 03:48:13,951
I should be clear he's asking about does supporting homosexuality

4616
03:48:14,207 --> 03:48:16,511
Does embracing and accepting

4617
03:48:16,767 --> 03:48:18,303
Just people being gay

4618
03:48:21,631 --> 03:48:24,191
I'm going to love you as softball question

4619
03:48:24,447 --> 03:48:30,591
Really easy let's just throw this one up there doesn't help us win the culture War that's the question yes

4620
03:48:30,847 --> 03:48:36,991
Yes or no it doesn't it does not it's hard why are you murdering

4621
03:48:37,247 --> 03:48:40,575
Why what did you do and it doesn't belong here you know

4622
03:48:41,343 --> 03:48:47,487
I like seeing Pete budajudge I was watching something the other day

4623
03:48:47,743 --> 03:48:50,815
No and stop

4624
03:48:51,839 --> 03:48:54,911
Look I don't want to get graphic or anything but it's just

4625
03:48:55,167 --> 03:48:55,679
Gross

4626
03:48:56,703 --> 03:48:57,471
Don't need that

4627
03:48:57,727 --> 03:48:59,007
It's not Christian

4628
03:48:59,519 --> 03:49:03,359
It's not natural it's not conservative it has no place so

4629
03:49:03,615 --> 03:49:05,663
I'm willing to say that Charlie Kirk ism

4630
03:49:09,247 --> 03:49:10,271
Alex

4631
03:49:10,527 --> 03:49:14,879
You're the perfect example of a curveball question that Alex cannot afford to have to answer

4632
03:49:15,647 --> 03:49:21,791
He spent a lot of his time cultivating the character that blurs the lines of outright homophobia and

4633
03:49:28,447 --> 03:49:34,591
One of Nick's followers directly asking if accepting homosexuality does any good

4634
03:49:34,847 --> 03:49:36,639
That poses a real challenge

4635
03:49:37,407 --> 03:49:41,247
It's clear from the raucous response when Nick says that homosexuality is gross

4636
03:49:41,503 --> 03:49:43,807
But that was the correct answer

4637
03:49:44,319 --> 03:49:49,695
So is Alex at a noncommittal political answer that maintains as wishy-washy

4638
03:49:49,951 --> 03:49:51,231
Find that accept

4639
03:49:51,999 --> 03:49:57,887
If you said that accepting homosexuality was good clearly be walking into a trap where you then have to defend a how

4640
03:49:58,143 --> 03:49:59,935
That is a conservative position

4641
03:50:00,447 --> 03:50:02,751
If he answered that homosexuality was bad

4642
03:50:03,007 --> 03:50:04,287
As Nick said it has no place

4643
03:50:04,543 --> 03:50:05,311
He runs the risk

4644
03:50:05,567 --> 03:50:08,383
Further alienating himself from the base that he has

4645
03:50:08,639 --> 03:50:12,479
Are the desperately needs to cling to the idea that Alex is not a bigot himself

4646
03:50:12,991 --> 03:50:15,039
No answer to that question serves Alex's interest

4647
03:50:15,295 --> 03:50:16,575
So he cannot be there

4648
03:50:17,087 --> 03:50:18,111
Cannot be involved

4649
03:50:18,879 --> 03:50:19,647
That's a smart move

4650
03:50:19,903 --> 03:50:26,047
In Alex's absences q-and-a session could turn into Nix followers asking him softball questions that they already know the answers

4651
03:50:26,303 --> 03:50:28,863
And when he gives the desired answer they all cheer

4652
03:50:29,375 --> 03:50:31,679
In effect this event has been fully taken over

4653
03:50:31,935 --> 03:50:34,239
This isn't the q-and-a session for anyone except

4654
03:50:34,495 --> 03:50:35,775
Who's giving all the A's

4655
03:50:36,287 --> 03:50:38,079
Accused being posed by his followers

4656
03:50:38,591 --> 03:50:39,615
He's fully Co-op

4657
03:50:39,871 --> 03:50:40,639
Did this event yep

4658
03:50:41,407 --> 03:50:43,199
It's honestly

4659
03:50:44,223 --> 03:50:45,247
Yeah I mean

4660
03:50:45,759 --> 03:50:46,271
But

4661
03:50:47,807 --> 03:50:48,575
What's what

4662
03:50:48,831 --> 03:50:49,599
Interesting to me

4663
03:50:49,855 --> 03:50:51,647
Is that it is essentially

4664
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:54,463
Calling out

4665
03:50:54,975 --> 03:50:55,999
People who have been

4666
03:50:56,511 --> 03:50:57,023
Exploiting

4667
03:50:57,535 --> 03:50:58,047
Layton

4668
03:50:58,559 --> 03:50:59,839
If not

4669
03:51:00,095 --> 03:51:01,631
Explicit bigotry and homophobia

4670
03:51:01,887 --> 03:51:03,679
Fair enough lying

4671
03:51:03,935 --> 03:51:06,239
About not being supported

4672
03:51:07,263 --> 03:51:08,799
No I'm

4673
03:51:09,055 --> 03:51:09,823
Totally bigot

4674
03:51:10,079 --> 03:51:11,615
I know I hate

4675
03:51:12,383 --> 03:51:15,455
Well I don't hate gay people you can't hate gay people

4676
03:51:15,967 --> 03:51:17,503
No I've been telling you that I hate you

4677
03:51:21,087 --> 03:51:23,391
Oh s*** no I've cultivated

4678
03:51:23,903 --> 03:51:25,183
Audience of monsters have

4679
03:51:26,207 --> 03:51:30,815
Guess I went to bed

4680
03:51:31,071 --> 03:51:37,215
Infowars audience like I don't I don't know Alex is audience even really use anymore how big they are

4681
03:51:37,471 --> 03:51:38,495
The only

4682
03:51:38,751 --> 03:51:42,591
Possible thing that can happen is Nick convincing them

4683
03:51:43,103 --> 03:51:47,199
But Alex has to milquetoast and he doesn't actually have two principles that he pretends to have absolutely

4684
03:51:47,455 --> 03:51:49,247
It's it's f***** up and if it

4685
03:51:49,503 --> 03:51:50,015
Continues

4686
03:51:50,271 --> 03:51:51,039
Like if it keeps going

4687
03:51:51,295 --> 03:51:51,807
Which I think of you

4688
03:51:52,063 --> 03:51:53,087
Huge mistake on Alex

4689
03:51:53,343 --> 03:51:54,879
Estes Park

4690
03:51:55,135 --> 03:51:56,415
He's in a position where he can't

4691
03:51:56,671 --> 03:51:57,183
Not

4692
03:51:57,439 --> 03:51:58,975
Still support Nick because

4693
03:51:59,231 --> 03:52:05,375
Implicit threat

4694
03:52:05,631 --> 03:52:07,935
Like a really dangerous position for his own

4695
03:52:08,703 --> 03:52:09,983
Position and steak

4696
03:52:10,239 --> 03:52:10,751
In the can

4697
03:52:11,007 --> 03:52:11,519
Conservative

4698
03:52:11,775 --> 03:52:12,799
It's a

4699
03:52:13,823 --> 03:52:14,335
It is

4700
03:52:14,591 --> 03:52:15,103
Fuct

4701
03:52:15,359 --> 03:52:19,199
It is it is really reminiscent of like

4702
03:52:19,455 --> 03:52:20,479
I mean again

4703
03:52:20,735 --> 03:52:21,503
Spell reminisce

4704
03:52:21,759 --> 03:52:22,271
Reagan

4705
03:52:22,527 --> 03:52:23,039
Where

4706
03:52:23,295 --> 03:52:23,807
It's

4707
03:52:24,063 --> 03:52:26,367
All of these people are suddenly

4708
03:52:27,391 --> 03:52:28,415
Creating this in surgeon

4709
03:52:28,671 --> 03:52:29,439
Space around

4710
03:52:29,695 --> 03:52:31,999
A political class that has been

4711
03:52:33,023 --> 03:52:35,839
Exploiting their homophobia without making it

4712
03:52:36,863 --> 03:52:39,423
Always always constantly just like

4713
03:52:39,935 --> 03:52:45,311
Hey you know those people with a with HIV do you have it you know you know those people like that

4714
03:52:45,823 --> 03:52:47,359
Anything without ever explicitly

4715
03:52:47,615 --> 03:52:49,919
We saying it and now they're forcing people to actually

4716
03:52:50,175 --> 03:52:50,687
We come down.

4717
03:52:51,199 --> 03:52:51,711
And they're like

4718
03:52:52,223 --> 03:52:52,991
Guys week

4719
03:52:53,247 --> 03:52:54,783
Can't actually hate

4720
03:52:55,807 --> 03:53:01,951
Which gives Firepower to the other side that's like you weren't really committed to principal

4721
03:53:02,207 --> 03:53:05,023
Hey Rhino what you mean is you're not actually a big

4722
03:53:05,535 --> 03:53:07,839
We really wanted out of you

4723
03:53:08,095 --> 03:53:09,887
You were lying to us about being

4724
03:53:10,143 --> 03:53:10,655
A bigot

4725
03:53:12,959 --> 03:53:17,055
And I honestly think that would Nick Fuentes doing will probably not have staying power

4726
03:53:17,567 --> 03:53:21,151
I think it'll probably be like in 2000

4727
03:53:21,919 --> 03:53:22,431
11

4728
03:53:22,687 --> 03:53:23,455
2012

4729
03:53:23,711 --> 03:53:25,247
Looking at the Tea Party you think like

4730
03:53:25,503 --> 03:53:28,063
This is going to be your forever because you're in the middle of

4731
03:53:28,319 --> 03:53:29,343
I don't see

4732
03:53:29,599 --> 03:53:30,623
I think that Nick is doing

4733
03:53:30,879 --> 03:53:31,391
Is

4734
03:53:31,647 --> 03:53:32,671
Be the next

4735
03:53:32,927 --> 03:53:33,439
Descendants

4736
03:53:33,951 --> 03:53:34,719
Part of the right

4737
03:53:37,023 --> 03:53:39,583
Potential to disrupt a lot of things

4738
03:53:40,095 --> 03:53:40,863
And it also has

4739
03:53:41,119 --> 03:53:42,143
Potential to

4740
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:45,215
Strengthen and reinforce a lot of the worst

4741
03:53:45,471 --> 03:53:47,519
Parts yeah we could have

4742
03:53:48,799 --> 03:53:49,567
But that doesn't

4743
03:53:50,335 --> 03:53:53,151
I don't know I'm not bought into the idea that

4744
03:53:53,407 --> 03:53:56,735
He is the next Rising Star the truth

4745
03:53:56,991 --> 03:54:03,135
The next William F Buckley

4746
03:54:04,415 --> 03:54:05,951
I don't I don't I don't think of that

4747
03:54:06,463 --> 03:54:07,231
But I think

4748
03:54:07,743 --> 03:54:10,559
Because we're in the present-day of because

4749
03:54:11,583 --> 03:54:12,351
Follow Alex

4750
03:54:12,863 --> 03:54:13,375
I have to record

4751
03:54:16,447 --> 03:54:18,239
And that's why you don't work with people like

4752
03:54:18,751 --> 03:54:21,567
This is why you have some kind of a standard of like

4753
03:54:21,823 --> 03:54:22,335
No

4754
03:54:22,591 --> 03:54:24,639
Getting involved here is only going to be

4755
03:54:25,407 --> 03:54:26,431
You should not

4756
03:54:27,199 --> 03:54:27,711
Engaged

4757
03:54:27,967 --> 03:54:31,295
Because when you engage you open up the possibility for them to

4758
03:54:31,551 --> 03:54:32,575
To completely fuk

4759
03:54:32,831 --> 03:54:34,367
Yeah yeah absolutely

4760
03:54:34,623 --> 03:54:36,415
They they're they're running a different grip

4761
03:54:36,927 --> 03:54:39,743
It's so funny because it is that

4762
03:54:39,999 --> 03:54:43,839
Like they're so hard right there doing exactly the same thing

4763
03:54:44,095 --> 03:54:49,471
The Anti-Defamation League is where it's like

4764
03:54:50,239 --> 03:54:54,591
But Alex for so long is like no no no I'm not racist there either

4765
03:54:54,847 --> 03:54:56,383
Fairly painting me is racist

4766
03:54:56,639 --> 03:54:58,175
And then the guys on the writer like

4767
03:54:58,687 --> 03:55:00,223
Oh you're not racist

4768
03:55:00,991 --> 03:55:02,527
Then you are foolish

4769
03:55:02,783 --> 03:55:05,599
Time to pay the Fiddler

4770
03:55:05,855 --> 03:55:08,927
There's a shining a light on whether or not you're actually races

4771
03:55:12,767 --> 03:55:14,047
Are you awake

4772
03:55:14,303 --> 03:55:14,815
Alex

4773
03:55:15,071 --> 03:55:17,631
Like because of whatever desperation he has or

4774
03:55:17,887 --> 03:55:18,399
Whatever

4775
03:55:18,911 --> 03:55:19,935
Brought it upon himself

4776
03:55:20,191 --> 03:55:23,775
I think it's interesting I really think that these psychodrama that I was describing

4777
03:55:24,031 --> 03:55:25,311
At the beginning of this episode

4778
03:55:25,567 --> 03:55:29,151
About this speech has a lot to do with the fact that

4779
03:55:29,663 --> 03:55:34,783
In the depressing as hell with the beginning there was no one there in the losers

4780
03:55:35,039 --> 03:55:36,575
And then as it goes along

4781
03:55:36,831 --> 03:55:38,623
Nick Fuentes fans show up

4782
03:55:38,879 --> 03:55:42,975
Really change the character of what's going on now at the same time

4783
03:55:43,231 --> 03:55:46,047
Because it was so depressing at the beginning out to f****** waste it

4784
03:55:46,303 --> 03:55:47,327
And he's in no position

4785
03:55:47,583 --> 03:55:48,863
To deal with any of this staff

4786
03:55:49,119 --> 03:55:50,655
I don't even know if he could sober

4787
03:55:51,167 --> 03:55:52,703
Absolutely not

4788
03:55:52,959 --> 03:55:53,727
So like

4789
03:55:53,983 --> 03:55:54,751
Tip of the spear

4790
03:55:55,007 --> 03:55:55,519
Likely

4791
03:55:56,799 --> 03:55:58,591
Dogs of the Americana movement

4792
03:55:58,847 --> 03:55:59,615
He goes to bed

4793
03:56:00,639 --> 03:56:01,151
It's great

4794
03:56:01,407 --> 03:56:05,247
It's just such perfect like it's exactly the payoff

4795
03:56:06,527 --> 03:56:09,855
A reminder at like I've run shows before where

4796
03:56:10,111 --> 03:56:11,391
It wound up being that

4797
03:56:11,647 --> 03:56:12,415
Steve feature Act

4798
03:56:13,439 --> 03:56:14,463
Brought like 50

4799
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:15,487
People

4800
03:56:15,743 --> 03:56:17,279
And the people who showed up not for the

4801
03:56:18,047 --> 03:56:18,559
We're like

4802
03:56:19,583 --> 03:56:20,607
And

4803
03:56:20,863 --> 03:56:22,399
Then everybody leaves

4804
03:56:22,655 --> 03:56:25,215
Because the teacher at all and I got to go do a different show

4805
03:56:25,471 --> 03:56:31,615
All 15 people Headliners no one there

4806
03:56:32,639 --> 03:56:38,783
Just go to bed

4807
03:56:39,039 --> 03:56:40,575
The guy they are here for

4808
03:56:40,831 --> 03:56:42,367
You're not leaving

4809
03:56:42,879 --> 03:56:43,391
So I mean

4810
03:56:44,415 --> 03:56:45,439
Building Bart Express

4811
03:56:46,719 --> 03:56:48,255
I would still be there Thursday

4812
03:56:48,511 --> 03:56:49,279
I'm sad I didn't

4813
03:56:49,535 --> 03:56:51,071
Get to go

4814
03:56:51,583 --> 03:56:57,727
Alive would have been outside

4815
03:56:58,239 --> 03:56:59,263
Nothing brutal

4816
03:56:59,519 --> 03:57:01,055
Watching it on a video

4817
03:57:01,311 --> 03:57:01,823
Plenty

4818
03:57:02,079 --> 03:57:07,199
Terrible if I was there and you saw the video you could definitely hear my cackle at all the wrong

4819
03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:10,015
So we have one last clip

4820
03:57:10,271 --> 03:57:14,111
It's the q-and-a session has gone the way it has

4821
03:57:14,367 --> 03:57:18,207
Lee Nick Fuentes his fans ask me a question

4822
03:57:18,463 --> 03:57:19,999
Highlight the differences but

4823
03:57:20,255 --> 03:57:21,535
Between themselves

4824
03:57:21,791 --> 03:57:23,071
And all the rest of conservative

4825
03:57:23,583 --> 03:57:25,119
Again not in Alex's intro

4826
03:57:25,887 --> 03:57:26,655
When is host

4827
03:57:27,167 --> 03:57:29,215
They get another question

4828
03:57:29,471 --> 03:57:29,983
And

4829
03:57:30,239 --> 03:57:30,751
It's not a question

4830
03:57:31,007 --> 03:57:36,127
It's a guy grabbing the mic and screaming directly into it about how Julian Assange needs to be pardoned

4831
03:57:36,895 --> 03:57:37,407
Owen Wilson

4832
03:57:37,663 --> 03:57:38,431
Do this for a little bit

4833
03:57:38,943 --> 03:57:40,735
And then this is how the event ends

4834
03:57:40,991 --> 03:57:46,111
When he delivers a miscarriage

4835
03:57:46,623 --> 03:57:52,767
Because when he was dead

4836
03:57:53,023 --> 03:57:59,167
I listen they listen we got to shut this down thanks everybody for coming I want to thank a speaker's here

4837
03:57:59,423 --> 03:57:59,935
Tonight

4838
03:58:00,191 --> 03:58:01,215
I'm just like that

4839
03:58:01,471 --> 03:58:03,519
That was this free speech some attend

4840
03:58:03,775 --> 03:58:04,799
Someone

4841
03:58:05,055 --> 03:58:09,407
Yell Italian

4842
03:58:09,663 --> 03:58:10,943
Then they are they all just

4843
03:58:11,199 --> 03:58:17,087
Las Verdes illescas 8 you can see from the video the bikes cut off and then people are Milling about talking

4844
03:58:21,439 --> 03:58:22,207
The show is over

4845
03:58:22,463 --> 03:58:22,975
Amadeus

4846
03:58:23,743 --> 03:58:27,839
I don't know about that even he was still standing on stage

4847
03:58:28,351 --> 03:58:33,215
I guess not yeah I don't know the Mikes are off so you can't really tell anybody

4848
03:58:33,727 --> 03:58:34,495
Shoot the ship

4849
03:58:35,519 --> 03:58:36,287
Pizza

4850
03:58:37,567 --> 03:58:38,591
Summit was

4851
03:58:38,847 --> 03:58:39,871
Embarrassed

4852
03:58:40,895 --> 03:58:41,663
Disaster

4853
03:58:42,175 --> 03:58:42,943
Summer stuff

4854
03:58:43,199 --> 03:58:43,711
It's like

4855
03:58:44,223 --> 03:58:45,247
Pretty funny though

4856
03:58:45,503 --> 03:58:46,527
And also very sad

4857
03:58:46,783 --> 03:58:49,599
Titus andronicus

4858
03:58:49,855 --> 03:58:53,183
Alex just said his family

4859
03:58:53,439 --> 03:58:54,463
It is

4860
03:58:54,719 --> 03:58:59,071
If you're Alex

4861
03:58:59,327 --> 03:59:00,351
Cuz he's invited

4862
03:59:00,607 --> 03:59:01,631
Into his own space

4863
03:59:01,887 --> 03:59:03,935
His own world the element

4864
03:59:04,703 --> 03:59:05,215
Could

4865
03:59:05,471 --> 03:59:06,239
I mean like we

4866
03:59:06,751 --> 03:59:08,031
We could maybe

4867
03:59:08,287 --> 03:59:10,079
Have some sort of an influence on his body

4868
03:59:10,335 --> 03:59:11,871
He's lying

4869
03:59:12,127 --> 03:59:13,919
That's kind of unlikely

4870
03:59:14,687 --> 03:59:15,967
But the element of Nick

4871
03:59:16,223 --> 03:59:22,367
Any more like you're not real conservative we are real cancer

4872
03:59:22,623 --> 03:59:27,743
Bremen terms of a language of like he doesn't really care about these issues that I serve

4873
03:59:28,255 --> 03:59:29,791
I could do some serious damage

4874
03:59:30,047 --> 03:59:32,095
He's invited into his own home

4875
03:59:32,351 --> 03:59:33,375
And boosted it

4876
03:59:33,631 --> 03:59:35,935
Can elevated it cuz he thinks he can get something out of it

4877
03:59:36,191 --> 03:59:36,703
Any chance

4878
03:59:36,959 --> 03:59:37,727
That road

4879
03:59:38,239 --> 03:59:38,751
Is blocked

4880
03:59:39,007 --> 03:59:41,567
Yeah he's not getting in for yours from the group

4881
03:59:42,079 --> 03:59:44,639
Is audience

4882
03:59:44,895 --> 03:59:46,687
To radicalize towards them

4883
03:59:46,943 --> 03:59:48,223
I will say this Direct

4884
03:59:50,783 --> 03:59:51,551
As a cautionary

4885
03:59:52,319 --> 03:59:53,599
You know those

4886
03:59:55,391 --> 03:59:57,439
Who give you that great theme song

4887
03:59:57,951 --> 04:00:01,791
You know the Sith you love so much.

4888
04:00:02,047 --> 04:00:05,119
Had one is destined to kill the master

4889
04:00:05,375 --> 04:00:07,167
That is how the Sith operate

4890
04:00:07,679 --> 04:00:08,959
You need to know this

4891
04:00:09,215 --> 04:00:09,983
Plan ahead

4892
04:00:10,239 --> 04:00:13,823
That's fair enough I still do Alex's resilient like a cockroach

4893
04:00:14,079 --> 04:00:17,407
That's all I don't think that you've going to be destroyed by this

4894
04:00:17,663 --> 04:00:19,455
What's going to make his job much harder

4895
04:00:20,223 --> 04:00:22,527
I think that enforces

4896
04:00:22,783 --> 04:00:24,575
Is resilient enough that he's going to be able to

4897
04:00:24,831 --> 04:00:26,367
To navigate this in summer

4898
04:00:26,623 --> 04:00:27,135
Perform

4899
04:00:27,391 --> 04:00:28,927
But I do think that

4900
04:00:29,183 --> 04:00:29,951
It could

4901
04:00:30,719 --> 04:00:32,767
If things keep going the way they're going to

4902
04:00:33,023 --> 04:00:35,327
Force him into situations where he has to make position

4903
04:00:36,351 --> 04:00:38,655
Been wishy-washy anything about in the past

4904
04:00:39,167 --> 04:00:40,191
And that was vague

4905
04:00:40,703 --> 04:00:41,215
Is very

4906
04:00:41,471 --> 04:00:42,239
Politically used

4907
04:00:43,519 --> 04:00:46,335
The Disappearance of that vagueness

4908
04:00:46,591 --> 04:00:47,615
Creates like

4909
04:00:47,871 --> 04:00:51,455
Because one of the things that the gripers are specifically

4910
04:00:51,711 --> 04:00:52,735
Aiming to do

4911
04:00:52,991 --> 04:00:55,039
Ismail people down on position

4912
04:00:56,575 --> 04:00:59,135
For Alex to have to be nailed down on something like

4913
04:00:59,391 --> 04:01:01,439
We should get rid of all foreign aid to is

4914
04:01:01,695 --> 04:01:03,487
What else does that imply

4915
04:01:03,743 --> 04:01:05,791
How does that change the rest of your cover

4916
04:01:06,559 --> 04:01:08,607
What what else comes from that

4917
04:01:09,119 --> 04:01:09,631
Or even

4918
04:01:09,887 --> 04:01:11,679
Getting rid of all legal immigration

4919
04:01:12,447 --> 04:01:13,471
What comes from that

4920
04:01:13,727 --> 04:01:15,775
Where where does how does your like

4921
04:01:16,287 --> 04:01:17,055
Your coverage

4922
04:01:17,311 --> 04:01:17,823
Have to change

4923
04:01:19,615 --> 04:01:21,407
It's a it's a it's a challenge she's not

4924
04:01:22,175 --> 04:01:28,319
And it could have cut down on his bottom line at a time when he really needs as much as you can

4925
04:01:28,575 --> 04:01:33,695
No idea but I had an interesting time and psychological rollercoaster watching this in

4926
04:01:34,207 --> 04:01:37,791
Glad to be able to share some of it not so much the failed

4927
04:01:38,047 --> 04:01:38,815
Congressional candidates

4928
04:01:39,327 --> 04:01:41,375
Now w

4929
04:01:45,983 --> 04:01:47,007
A

4930
04:01:47,263 --> 04:01:48,543
Great case for

4931
04:01:51,359 --> 04:01:52,639
For the

4932
04:01:52,895 --> 04:01:54,687
Axesspointe only being able to come

4933
04:01:54,943 --> 04:01:55,455
From the right

4934
04:01:56,479 --> 04:02:00,575
I think I think that's probably know you know what I'm saying like there's no there's no

4935
04:02:00,831 --> 04:02:01,343
Pressure that the

4936
04:02:01,599 --> 04:02:02,623
The left could put on Alex

4937
04:02:02,879 --> 04:02:04,159
To nail him down on

4938
04:02:06,207 --> 04:02:06,719
Not really

4939
04:02:06,975 --> 04:02:08,767
He can always just

4940
04:02:09,023 --> 04:02:10,815
But coming from an ascendant

4941
04:02:11,071 --> 04:02:11,583
Talent like

4942
04:02:15,423 --> 04:02:17,983
And particularly with inorganic

4943
04:02:18,239 --> 04:02:20,287
Base of people behind him

4944
04:02:20,543 --> 04:02:23,871
Without that Nick wouldn't have as much right

4945
04:02:25,919 --> 04:02:26,687
Because he has

4946
04:02:27,199 --> 04:02:28,479
A bunch of people and

4947
04:02:28,991 --> 04:02:30,527
Make it look at the room Alex doesn't

4948
04:02:31,551 --> 04:02:35,135
Yeah it does create a relative power imbalance absolute

4949
04:02:35,391 --> 04:02:38,207
It's the it's the purity test of the big

4950
04:02:38,719 --> 04:02:40,255
And Alex

4951
04:02:40,511 --> 04:02:43,839
Inevitably fail that if he sticks to what he's been doing forever

4952
04:02:45,375 --> 04:02:48,191
Force himself into satisfying that purity test

4953
04:02:48,703 --> 04:02:49,727
And then he becomes

4954
04:02:49,983 --> 04:02:51,263
Covertly a bigot

4955
04:02:51,519 --> 04:02:54,335
It's like

4956
04:02:54,591 --> 04:02:55,359
Ironic

4957
04:02:55,615 --> 04:02:56,639
ATO of

4958
04:02:56,895 --> 04:02:58,175
Look the ATL

4959
04:02:58,687 --> 04:03:00,223
Point out all the ways that your erase

4960
04:03:00,735 --> 04:03:03,039
But only racist can make you say it

4961
04:03:03,295 --> 04:03:06,111
Only races can be like are you a racist

4962
04:03:06,623 --> 04:03:08,159
TXU

4963
04:03:08,927 --> 04:03:11,743
I will see what happens back Jordan

4964
04:03:11,999 --> 04:03:13,023
