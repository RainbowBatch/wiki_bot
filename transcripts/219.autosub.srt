Pretty calmly say to everyone

15
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336

21
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Someone has taken a donation and bump it up

50
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Still download the episode but you don't need to listen to it

51
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
Will be for the reveal

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
I guess I don't know.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
It's just a big buck right

54
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
I remember when I was a kid being overwhelmed by the size of it

55
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
I just did I just

56
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
What do you mean there's a sense of accomplishment

57
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,631
Read the last page

58
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
Going to be that great but if you read all of it the last page probably awesome

59
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
Pretty great

60
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Infinite Jest

00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
Austin Dune to be like two examples of books

62
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,223
That just needs to be as like sort of stereotypic

63
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Example

64
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
I don't know

65
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
I'm just

66
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
I think I kind

67
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
Sure

68
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,911
Once he gets to the list of movies

69
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,823
We're going over March 13th 2009 today

70
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
He's a big old day in history

71
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
I know I mentioned last week that this episode was kind of difficult for me because he brings up a number of things that

72
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
The research

73
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
I didn't want to take

74
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Too many

75
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
We end up

76
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Discussion about something we end up with that

77
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
6 hour episode on

78
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
The fight because there's a lot of meat to get into

79
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
And then on top of that

80
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
There's something you need to know

81
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Chuck Norris

82
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375

Furious about it cuz I'm in limbo right now

I tried to write him back this morning but I haven't heard back

92
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503

Check already was

101
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
President

102
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,759
Metaphorical

103
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
But

104
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Pack

105
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Episode

106
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
I also I will say spoiler alert Chuck Norris

107
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Okay

108
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
What things it pisses me off so much

109
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Play The Walker

110
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Ranger theme

111
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Play him onto the show

112
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
Cuz it would be perfect for him

113
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,903
Play the theme song from that's my jam right there

114
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Weather Ranger

115
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
I love that pizza me and Nikki gift live together back in Missouri he was going through a bit of a walker to

116
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Texas Rangers

117
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,895
It's a realtor.com

118
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
Valuing that show man

119
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
Okay

120
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
All of them

121
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
And they're all the same

122
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Extra tall

123
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Anyway Chuck Norris is going to show up a little bit later

124
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Wasn't that was not show just essentially

125
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
Texas Ranger

126
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,055
That really doesn't make me feel comfortable

127
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Turn around

128
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Yeah yeah

129
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,391
Anyway the reason that Alex wanted to have

130
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
He's going to

131
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
To do

132
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Episode of

133
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
And

134
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
There's talk

135
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Videos going to

136
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Is going to make a big amount

137
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
You're absolutely right

138
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
He just wants to scoop

139
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
Eddie and the mad about this

140
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
To check doors

141
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Conceivably since the last time he mentions in that club

142
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,391
And then

143
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Kiri check

144
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,023
Is going to be on Glenn Beck show and he's shooting at an email

145
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
ASAP

146
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,935
This is the response

147
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,799
Becca's going to take this one from me what am I going to do realize there's a

148
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Decent chance

149
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
He's already

150
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Cuz I don't think it's alive.

151
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Two are so

152
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
Let me let me just put the pin in this

153
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
There is no scoop

154
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,647
Alex

155
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:40,767
You could announce he's running for president of Texas

156
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:46,655
Because that's what like really bad presumptive media it started throwing away a lot of the blogs that Alex

157
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Information from

158
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Been like

159
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
Is Chuck Norris

160
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
That sort of thing is going to be the one who brings us back

161
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Bowflex

162
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Really badly

163
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Here's the clip

164
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
Of him disappear

165
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Get them on before he talks to Glenda

166
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
Hours notice

167
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
If that will happen because obviously I can have them on next week

168
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,335
He's

169
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Chuck Norris's

170
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Probably going around

171
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
I think he's doing a lot of fat I think in 2019

172
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Is it the Chuck Norris fact

173
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,223
I seem to recall around this time

174
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
A big part of his PR strategy was really embracing

175
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Does joke

176
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
Congratulations everybody

177
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
In this next clip we get back to one of the narratives

178
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
It's been really robots

179
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Did Miss March

180
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
2009

181
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
. of time in that

182
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
Is the documents

183
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,455
Alex

184
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
Misunderstands much like a junior high

185
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Eli's more about it

186
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
Two days ago we broke the news

187
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
With a standard system update

188
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
Are they also recommend

189
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
Sergeant

190
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Phone numbers

191
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,919
Additional

192
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
It is real

193
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
He's making that Elementary

194
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
He makes about

195
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
The idea that

196
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Just to drive it home again

197
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
The idea of this doctor

198
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Commence sayings

199
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,903
The people who are malicious

200
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Often

201
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Are supporters of Ron Paul

202
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Does not mean

203
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
If you are wrong

204
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
You are suspicious to me of being in one of the

205
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
These groups

206
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
He believes those two statements are equivalent

207
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Depart

208
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Vicky thinks

209
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Disinfo agent

210
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Are saying

211
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
You're wrong about

212
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
And choosing to respond to

213
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,807
If what they're saying is this isn't real

214
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
It makes the next Baltimore funny

215
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Realize

216
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
But there is that lion

217
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,727
People say we exaggerate the other way around

218
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,943
Overestimating

219
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
It's far worse than

220
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,855
He's holding restraint

221
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
He is keeping himself under control for your benefit

222
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,375
What if there were a billion people on the border

223
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:39,007
His narrative right now like in 2009 involve a shadowy group

224
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Of all powerful

225
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Super rich

226
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Individuals that are all working

227
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Sing together

228
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
And their plan is any

229
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
The dollars and when civil unrest breaks out they have can't build everywhere

230
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,415
People in forcefully anybody who talks up

231
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
They will release bio weapons

232
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
At which point I guess the rest of

233
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Ulcer

234
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
To these globalist to have armored without

235
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
And then I guess kill the rest I don't know

236
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
How could he not be like

237
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
At least trying to say he would like

238
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
That's what he talked about 9% of the time

239
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
At least

240
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
That's actually part of

241
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
The FEMA camp

242
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
Committee

243
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
FEMA all the Federal Emergency

244
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,663
Goodwin right now

245
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Because I hate masculinity

246
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
Well then I guess it's

247
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Sure

248
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,415
That's religion silly but in this next clip we get to

249
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,975
Start at the beginning of one of the B

250
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Neat

251
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
He's going to be talking

252
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
And this is actually super complicated

253
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
That I'm able to adequately

254
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Break this down but I also

255
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
Dua to stress that you should have Quest

256
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Because this is

257
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,175
Anyway here's the first clip of Alex

258
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
About

259
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Globalist

260
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
.

261
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,999
Record

262
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,703
Powerful group

263
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
The same thing we do everyday

264
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
Conquer the world

265
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
So you don't care

266
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
Just do it

267
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
And the Brain

268
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
You don't say

269
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
Conquer the world

270
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
How can you do it everyday

271
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
How can conquer the world

272
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Wow there's a new worlds to conquer every time you wake up

273
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Upser

274
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,943
It seems like

275
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
We're going to conquer the world

276
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,599
Do you see it is boring I see it is like a motivational poster

277
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,791
So in the middle of this episode here

278
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Alex

279
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Impromptu history lesson

280
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Which offers us

281
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Context clues

282
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
He's getting his information

283
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
In this case

284
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Because he mentions The Milner

285
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,895
Literally no doubt

286
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
If there's only one

287
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,807
Part of this is because most Scholars many of them don't believe that the Milner group

288
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Conceived

289
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
The formal body acts

290
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Do we ever exist

291
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,695
Okay

292
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,279
Group of work together in the British

293
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
British established

294
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,839
In the early

295
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,935
All the information about The Milner group

296
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Books by Carroll Quigley

297
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
The anglo-american establishment

298
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
And tragedy

299
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
In the books

300
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Professor Quigley lays out what

301
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
He's researched about these groups that operated

302
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Behind the scene

303
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
He's concluded that groups like The Roundtable group

304
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
The society

305
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Association of helpers

306
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Elements

307
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Which he is titled

308
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

309
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
Absolutely

310
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,543
Extraordinary

311
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
Sean Connery playing

312
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,479
Everyone knows it everyone knows

313
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
You don't have you don't have them there I thought I had a story about falling asleep

314
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255
Boring story

315
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,399
The group The Miller group is named after Alfred Milner

316
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
M1891

317
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
The story presented in Quickly's work isn't interested

318
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Until

319
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
It's something that lacks back and support from a lot of other scholar

320
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Quigley himself offers Vista

321
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,711
Adduction to the anglo-american

322
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Establishment

323
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,343
Naturally it's not possible for an outsider to write about a secret group without falling

324
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
The errors

325
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
Terrorism

326
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
I feel also that there are few Miss statements of fact

327
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
Except in one most difficult matter

328
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
He doesn't care

329
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,911
Whew misstatement

330
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
The facts

331
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Accepted one most difficult

332
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
The difficulty arises from the problem of knowing just who is and who is not a member of

333
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:09,759
The group membership may not be rather on frequent socialist

334
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Incense the frequency of such Association

335
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Different person

336
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
The person

337
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
It's not always easy to say who's in the group who is Notch

338
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,048
Caveat

339
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
You don't know who's in the

340
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,144
The group I got the broad Strokes of it

341
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
A major players who are definitely

342
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
The fiends

343
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:38,432
Deeply involved in British foreign policy colonialism in the early 1900s

344
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Percent but then a lot of the conclusions

345
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
Are based on assumption

346
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Who is or is not in

347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Dissociative

348
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
Even innocent

349
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
A unified

350
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Or if there's just like

351
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh this one group is

352
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
That they do act

353
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
This other group does why

354
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,632
But sometimes there

355
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,936
They're a little bit

356
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Hitmaka.

357
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
They're working together

358
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
We are discreet stepper

359
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Groups

360
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
There's a difficulty about that

361
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
But foremost

362
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Facebook

363
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Islam

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
Until

365
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
It reads

366
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
Like a scholarly book

367
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
And it doesn't seem like he's making

368
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Seems like

369
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Plausible

370
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,096
I just don't like any book that opens with a preemptive

371
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,936
Sure I didn't tell the truth

372
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,520
Sure it is tough CouchTuner like

373
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
How could I

374
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Until there's a little bit of

375
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
About that

376
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Interesting

377
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Because they don't say what Alex said they

378
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,624
What does the same thing as Alec

379
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
What is the Naked Cowboy

380
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
A 1970 book by

381
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
Your buddy W Cleon skousen

382
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,560
Love him which is little more than attempted

383
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Quigley's tax

384
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Never said

385
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Quickly instead of scouting book

386
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Book is full of Miss reference

387
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
Plantations and factual errors

388
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
He claims that I've written

389
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Conspiracy of

390
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
The super-rich were pro-communist

391
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
And wish to take over the world and that I'm a member of the

392
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,040
You're going to save to the whole life

393
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
He was lying about it

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Because how else could he know this information

395
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,256
Member of this group

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Pieces of

397
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Carol Quigley's worldview is

398
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
He's

399
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Describing these group

400
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
They have the influence that they had

401
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
The time that they had it

402
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
That influence

403
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Deteriorated

404
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
40 Sprite

405
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Is work when it's being used by

406
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Skousen

407
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
He says

408
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
No

409
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
They never stop

410
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
And to say

411
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
Just have some influence

412
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Had all of the influence

413
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Make that make sense

414
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,352
W Cleon skousen in the naked capitalist

415
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Argues

416
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Part of these groups

417
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,448
And this

418
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
Partial revelation

419
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Is

420
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,544
Hiding the real truth

421
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
Which is worth

422
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Cleon skousen

423
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
Edward Alex Jones

424
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,200
Pretends is what

425
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,528
So it's almost like

426
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,880
Skousen is saying that the Eastern deity company is X

427
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Are we still in operation

428
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
It has been running

429
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,840
You can make that analog there

430
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,192
Only 8000 copy

431
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
1300 page book

432
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
But no publisher would expect to move copies

433
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Enter W Cleon skousen

434
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,968
Who's the

435
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
Add extra pages

436
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,624
Anti-communist propaganda conjecture you have a book with Mark appeal

437
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
He claimed a year after printing that he sold over

438
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
55000 copies

439
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
He was being distributed through the Liberty Lobby

440
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
If you don't recall the Liberty lobby with the outlets

441
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
Willis carto

442
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,872
Found the populist party

443
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:25,504
Through the Liberty Lobby cardo published Spotlight which was literally created specifically

444
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
For the purpose of quote mobilizing the public

445
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
He sought to use of publication

446
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,440
The fan the Flames of government

447
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,232
In order that they come together again

448
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
Against the Real Enemy

449
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
And quotes

450
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,960
Right communism nationalism

451
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Picture here

452
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
In essence Alex Jones has mold

453
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
Around the absolute

454
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Temptation of Carroll Quigley work

455
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Which was published

456
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,856
Demonize communist

457
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
And it was published

458
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
Promoted by Holocaust deniers

459
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Who made their life's work

460
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Demonizing

461
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
You are going to move

462
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
If you call it Harry Potter in the middle

463
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
That is going to have

464
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Vitale

465
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,288
Is getting this from Cleon skousen

466
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Absolute

467
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
But he never said that

468
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,968
He always says that he's getting it from white papers

469
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
State tragedy

470
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,904
He never says oh I got this from a notoriously Santa

471
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Communist propaganda

472
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Who is aligned with the Liberty Lobby

473
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
W Cleon skousen

474
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
Has papers you can get

475
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,144
Barry White

476
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
And the funked-up thing is it's not be

477
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
Because W Cleon skousen would be a name that'll be like a verb

478
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
Alex's show

479
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
His nephew

480
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
You Joel skousen is on

481
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
He's a regular cat not like

482
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:01,760
This would be some taboo I think Alex on sublevel knows that there's more credibility to

483
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Carroll Quigley

484
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,368
Then Cleon

485
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Angle

486
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
This guy wasn't

487
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
Presented as the original Angela

488
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Birthday Ava

489
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
Research something that is unknowable

490
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
And

491
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
Lying about those still further

492
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:31,456
Sure one of the other things

493
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Cookies and Hitler early on

494
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,272
You bet they did

495
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,880
If they absolutely did

496
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
Crucial error and regret it

497
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
So

498
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
I think

499
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
Most people did

500
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,704
And that boat one Holocaust anything

501
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
This might have been a bad idea

502
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
Holocaust

503
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,128
Now we're in the kind of like

504
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
224 Holocaust

505
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Minimum

506
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
For people to change their mind

507
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,320
Glimmers of what Alex

508
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
Is getting misrepresented

509
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
Cleon skousen

510
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
If you look at

511
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,952
Attacks of

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
I'm here I'll read you a little Passage

513
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
1936 whittler

514
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Just broke several

515
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Treatise

516
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
Members of The Milner group in of the British can

517
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Conservative government

518
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
The fantastic idea

519
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,664
They could kill two birds

520
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
Eastern Europe

521
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
In this way they felt that the two enemies would still make one another or the Germany would become satisfied with the oil of Romania and

522
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
The weed of Ukraine

523
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
It never occurred to anyone in a responsible position to Germany

524
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,048
And Russia might make a common cause

525
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Even temporarily

526
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Against the West

527
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,912
Even lasted it occur to them that Russia might beat German

528
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
And that's open all Central Europe to V

529
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
From Carroll Quigley

530
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,592
Who has looked at their

531
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Friends

532
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,224
Among the people that he's writing about

533
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,296
Yeah

534
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
Does anybody who's had

535
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
To the folks

536
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
But he's writing

537
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Jesus hurting

538
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
That

539
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
This was an oops

540
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
You hate to say that about WWII

541
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
They chose

542
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
The single worst

543
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Strategy that you possibly could

544
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Until it was

545
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
To like

546
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
MMA were and then they were like

547
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,712
Foolish view of

548
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,808
Everything foreign policy

549
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
But you can also kind of

550
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
What's the British

551
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Early 1930s headed distorted

552
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
But also from that

553
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,400
Part of the angle make American establishment

554
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
Integrate

555
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
How

556
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
There's obviously

557
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Issues

558
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
In France

559
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,944
Doesn't care about

560
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
Some sort of balance

561
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Giveaways it

562
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
You could

563
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,112
Not have all that WWII preferable

564
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,208
Until there's that Holocaust

565
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,888
Talk about this without getting a little bit

566
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Is

567
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
This Miller group

568
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Supposedly main forces Bhai

569
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Alfred Milner

570
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Cecil Rhodes

571
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
That is cousin

572
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,688
Derek Whitman

573
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
No

574
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:48,320
Do you know how Rhodesia got its name

575
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,672
It's named after Cecil Rhodes

576
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
All this saying that Alex

577
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:04,192
Who's lying about all this

578
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
They were deeply involved in

579
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,568
In the colonization of Africa

580
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,336
And

581
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Did horrible

582
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Here is the neck

583
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Best clip from Alex's

584
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Discussion of

585
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Hitler David David

586
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
The Milner group

587
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
Said something else

588
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,160
Me to nowhere

589
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,872
Divide and conquer

590
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,432
Fascist or right-wing

591
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,368
The Socialist

592
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,928
Big 4S

593
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,304
Western Europe

594
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Hitler

595
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
So

596
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
This

597
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Creative life

598
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Which would be

599
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Very ironic

600
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
That would be

601
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,272
I don't know I think Alex is taking the real pieces that exist in the world

602
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,112
Hitler and him being supported by

603
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Industrialists

604
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
For a while

605
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Udoka

606
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Avenue

607
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,264
Become more serious when the party power and stuff like that you know

608
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
Has never made that mistake

609
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,456
We can't really understand now

610
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Understand

611
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Do mean

612
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,648
He's getting this from to

613
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,464
A 1971 Gary Allan's none dare call it

614
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Conspiracy

615
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
In once

616
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,888
I'm from and misrepresented Carol quickly

617
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,168
Quickly

618
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Much for none dare call it

619
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
They thought dr. Carroll Quigley

620
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Affect

621
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:24,992
Bitlord Milner the dominant Trustee of the Cecil Rhodes trust and heavy in the group

622
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
Help Finance

623
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,136
Through the greater part of Milner's private papers and found no evidence to support

624
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,256
Sing about the Creator

625
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,888
What was reflected in

626
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,424
B that I read

627
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
You from his book anglo-american

628
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Come up with some balance

629
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,128
Power with Germany in the middle of Europe

630
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
Andrusha / 2

631
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
The Beast

632
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
And hope everything works out

633
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,808
That does not mean that they created a Bolshevik Revolution or they

634
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
Created Hitler

635
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
Alex

636
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,720
From these bastardize sources of the original material

637
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,000
The Fall Guy Dan

638
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,048
You know who is funding them

639
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Probably the Rothschild

640
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,424
Alchemy Soros Soros

641
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,824
Sherlock

642
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Westeros

643
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,976
So in a March 23rd 75 article

644
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:39,744
Hampton post

645
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,304
Okapis began to spread across the

646
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,192
Quickly began to grasp with a selective unauthorized quotation from his work

647
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,752
The approach to history taken by the authors

648
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
None dare call it

649
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,872
Scholastic sensibilities

650
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
Against the misinformation he felt was being disseminated with the aid of

651
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
My reputation

652
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Can quickly said

653
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,208
Scholarly historians were going to say he's one of those

654
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,888
He's kind of feel for the guy you know cuz there's not much

655
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:24,288
Can do Willy's response book was 800 more pages

656
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Regal Research

657
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Distinction

658
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
But what you

659
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
Claims with

660
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
Sentences and then just say

661
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
Me a book filled with tweets

662
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,008
The other real tragedy for Quigley to was that like

663
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
Because he wasn't getting a 1300 page scholarly book

664
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Unexpected

665
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
You then you got Tucker

666
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,808
Cleon skousen coming out selling 55,000 of it in a year making all that money or the Liberty Lobby

667
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
A bunch of that money

668
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
Arise quotation of his work

669
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
Then by the same token you now have

670
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
Gary Allen coming out with none dare call it

671
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
And none of that movie at money is

672
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Rawlins

673
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
That sucks

674
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,848
His books

675
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
So we can get Ken Burns

676
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,512
Can Lily take shows up

677
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,840
This is the last clip from this section

678
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Talking about

679
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,424
The misrepresentation

680
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Please work

681
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,984
I only kept

682
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
Because like

683
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
The real

684
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Function of what

685
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
He's doing

686
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Is really just

687
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Kind of lighting

688
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
Gettler roster

689
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
It's weird

690
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Cuz he's super close at

691
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
I think in the next Clipper saying

692
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
After I take in Europe and then knockout

693
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
Jimmy also want the Elder of Downey

694
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:49,952
He would only let Jews Escape

695
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,608
Palestine

696
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Oh yeah

697
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
Like it's not

698
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
Denial

699
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
Pure is denial but

700
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Man this

701
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
This is so close to the rhetoric that you see

702
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
In all sorts of places

703
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Blame

704
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,392
Hidden behind the scenes for the Holocaust itself

705
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:25,792
Write the Rothschild

706
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,632
I used to really hate

707
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,424
Betrayed I'm really starting to feel for this

708
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Like he brings up that

709
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Rudolf Hess story

710
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
About him

711
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,384
Parachuting out of an airplane

712
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
With

713
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Or something like that but I remember that episode

714
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,392
But do you really caught me off-guard was that Alex

715
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Rudolf Hess with a war

716
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
That's not

717
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
He's sort of

718
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Swallows

719
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
World War 1 hero

720
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
But even that's not great

721
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,960
I don't like letting Hitler off the hook for everything

722
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
MN calling Rudolph

723
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,408
Looked in you have a lot of misconceptions

724
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,504
That's because you've been reading the liberal history

725
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:23,136
Is that makes you a race traitor awesome for me to say race-traitor

726
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
Because that's what's really important

727
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Seems like that

728
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,328
Yeah so now we're done with that section today so we can move on to Alex having

729
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,656
More fun saying stupid s***

730
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,264
Henderson urges caution on community garden

731
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:44,128
Ricky Gervais

732
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,536
They're cracking down on you getting your own food because they want you hungry so they can get you into those FEMA camp

733
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:07,168
Are they are they going after subsistence farmers

734
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,752
No this is about a city council meeting

735
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
In Tulsa

736
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Henderson

737
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Tulsa City-County

738
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Counselor

739
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,968
And what the issue here is not about Gardens

740
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
It's about community

741
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,344
Actually this article is less about the marijuana issue

742
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,136
That you don't stay here

743
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,976
Growing vegetables

744
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
Is there going to be someone inspect what's growing

745
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
Community garden

746
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Kind of understand

747
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,912
I don't think it matters that much

748
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
But that's just one point that he brings up

749
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,080
The main concern is the ideas like

750
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,152
What land are we using

751
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,432
How is it going

752
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,968
I meant what is it falls into

753
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,552
Repair whose responsibility is that if it just becomes overgrown

754
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Is that the city's responsibility

755
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Are we going to have to

756
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
For that

757
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Play

758
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
But now you have a community garden here and then the homeowner

759
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,584
Or the property owner is then responsible for the overgrowth of the garden

760
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,352
Yeah

761
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,936
There's more issues here than just the idea of

762
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
On the other hand

763
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
I mean if the community garden dude everybody

764
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,296
Everybody just kind of has it has a weird

765
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Pop up

766
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Political system that grows around those where

767
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,232
To somebody but you don't know who for a while and then yet

768
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:40,096
Meet a couple of people in the know and then you find out who's running things and you ask for a plot

769
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
And the person who's running things

770
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
Self-appointed because they just showed up

771
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
Probably

772
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,520
The bag lady

773
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,687
It's also Erica

774
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
Wait where was I going with that I'm not sure but also in this article it says that they would support the amendment and if

775
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
Pressing problems

776
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
Go back to make sure

777
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,791
They want but it is this article that he's reporting on

778
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
It is really

779
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,351
Just about the city code enforcement

780
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,655
And whether or not it will require

781
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
To clean up places

782
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Fall in

783
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Being

784
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
If it's a private place

785
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,431
How are we going to make them clean it up

786
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Look there

787
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,791
About it

788
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,631
What are we doing here because it's a simple way for him to

789
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,911
His pre-existing narratives

790
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Into a story that doesn't

791
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,847
Listen to

792
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,895
A lot of these on The Cutting Room floor

793
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,967
I just heard a telephone Oklahoma

794
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Parking

795
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Buy $0.05

796
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Reviews

797
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,863
And now we can't get it anymore

798
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
I don't live in Tulsa Oklahoma

799
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
So

800
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
We move on from this story

801
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Who's breaking news

802
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,615
On the Alex Jones Show

803
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Courtesy of

804
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
A family member of Alex's or should I say

805
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
Whistleblower

806
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,303
Do people be brainwashed

807
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,799
Sororities and fraternities

808
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
This just happened

809
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
Last week

810
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Crazy

811
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Sew in

812
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,975
Dentist community

813
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
They are warning

814
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,071
Dentist

815
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,751
They put their colors in their teeth

816
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,799
I would only believe

817
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
This was

818
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,639
Kappa beta incisor

819
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,455
I would only believe this in anyway if it was about like

820
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
Look out for people

821
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
Or something like that

822
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,439
Only white

823
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,767
A dentist's is always like

824
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
Play the Paul Wall video and they're like

825
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,143
See if miscarry

826
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
It's in the back is like

827
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Dude I make

828
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
Millions of Grey

829
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:04,383
You guys are losing money by being racist

830
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Yeah that's

831
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,039
Good song

832
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
Anyway

833
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
We get again

834
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,487
He's our favorite South African gold exploiter ladies and gentlemen

835
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
Bobby Chapman

836
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
Remember that

837
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
And it's in comprehend

838
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
To beat it is what two pieces

839
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,111
Expected from the

840
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
The people who control

841
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Are federal

842
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
You noticed that immediately I didn't think you were going to text

843
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
Everyone else

844
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,871
Boy

845
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,151
This is one of those things

846
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
It's really essential to understand

847
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,295
Berkeley in different ways with

848
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
People

849
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,391
Only

850
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:22,207
To talk about the dollar collapsing and Snelling

851
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Anderson

852
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,303
That's the only reason he exist on the show

853
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Why comes on all the

854
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
He's a credible source

855
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
Order to force people into a mindset

856
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
Difficult

857
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,383
So when Alex wants to bring up the miac report which is Big narrative it

858
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
She's on now

859
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
In order to make it amenable to

860
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
I have to get to which is selling gold

861
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
He has to bring in if

862
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
Dubai gold

863
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
Yeah

864
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Perfect I am looking

865
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
Chuck Norris buddy throws in

866
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,119
See there we go

867
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
You guys if you can decide

868
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
River Phoenix

869
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Speak of the devil

870
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
It is time

871
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,711
Chuck Norris to make his appearance on the show

872
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:21,855
Chuck Norris

873
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,975
Come on late last year

874
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,519
President president of the u.s.

875
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,335
She's really excited

876
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
He's

877
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
I guess if you're the president of United States

878
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,783
Does Alex consider do the president of the United States

879
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
True

880
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,855
Work there

881
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
This interview

882
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
Is weird

883
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,535
Cuz it will say there is a piece of Alex Jones interview

884
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Chuck Norris

885
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,095
Turns weird

886
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,423
I'm kind of cool with

887
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,775
And that is like Chuck Norris talking about

888
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
I know I guess

889
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
Exercise equipment

890
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,407
Kids

891
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
Schools martial arts

892
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,063
Some stuff like that you know martial arts are good ways to have discipline and

893
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
You know all that stuff

894
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
There's two examples people I know

895
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,231
In the media who are real into martial arts

896
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
32-count Eddie Bravo

897
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
We got Chuck Norris

898
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
Joe Rogan Eddie Bravo

899
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
All of them

900
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Seem to be in great shape

901
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,447
But

902
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,775
Proclivity for hanging out with fashion

903
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:49,151
Karate until I was like

904
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
12

905
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,551
Only now looking back I realize how many of those guys were like

906
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
A lot of people want to take a ride

907
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Self-defense

908
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
Some people

909
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,071
To know how to straight up murderer

910
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
Industry

911
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,911
What if it

912
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,847
For one of those

913
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,639
But if you if you're

914
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Super into karate

915
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,759
You're allowed

916
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,879
I could see that mentality being there

917
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
I think it's wrong or weird at all to do martial arts

918
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,023
But I wonder if there's something in the nature of

919
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
That

920
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Discipline

921
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Ability to

922
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
Get that control over yourself

923
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
I wonder if there's an element of

924
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,543
In martial arts that is so predicated on

925
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
Subservient

926
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
The master

927
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
And I wonder

928
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:01,087
If that there is a necessary but I wonder if there's something in there that leads towards a mindset that is very

929
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,135
Malleable to authoritarianism

930
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,023
You know what I mean I don't know if that's the case I'm just depends on the

931
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,607
If you had like a hard line Realty

932
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,935
Yes master you kind of like I am the king of this

933
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
This

934
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Another word for dojo

935
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,527
It's small but it's all about discipline and

936
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,087
Submission version of yourself

937
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,135
The display of the master

938
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
Why would

939
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Be something

940
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
That you have now have practice

941
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
I don't know

942
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
I think that's a weak link

943
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
I mean I think it's I think

944
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
It's more likely that

945
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
You're getting people who are

946
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
Incline's of violet

947
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,895
Syrian government

948
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Give them

949
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Free rein tax

950
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Exercise

951
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Whenever they want to

952
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
This interview

953
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
He's very strange

954
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,671
That is very strange

955
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
Is that

956
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
Alex wants this a noun

957
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
He wants

958
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
To know what it is

959
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Do your run to the president

960
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,703
Glenn Beck that's all he really want

961
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
And unfortunately

962
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,103
I don't think the Chuck Norris knows that Alex Jones hates Glenn Beck

963
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,455
Glenn Beck

964
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,015
It started the yellow thing called

965
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Do we surround them with the means

966
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:39,391
9 principles that they do that.

967
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:43,487
We America should I live by America's good I believe in God and

968
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Center my life

969
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,863
Much more honest person than I was yesterday

970
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,703
He don't think of that sort they are than the 12 values of honesty rapper

971
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
Hope Thrift

972
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,007
So forth and so on

973
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,055
And so really

974
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
Glenn beckert

975
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,103
Trying to say today

976
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,687
Back to the values that we had

977
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
For many many years and we're drifting off

978
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
The Bad and The

979
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
And I totally agree what they

980
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
So

981
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
Alex wants to scoop

982
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Gotten back

983
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,791
Eddie's accidentally doing the commercial for Glenn Beck yeah celebrity guests

984
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
12512 movement

985
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
What ends up happening

986
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,639
Never join

987
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
The pity party

988
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,759
Because I realized

989
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
Glenn Beck

990
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
Get that machine moving

991
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
But no

992
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
It's already in high gear

993
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,279
On March 13th

994
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,095
They're going to start pushing the 912 movement

995
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,143
Which is what the announcement is

996
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
Bentley helping

997
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
I think there's a decent chance

998
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
They're what ends up happening

999
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,847
Alex never really

1000
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
But

1001
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,663
Consistently says that he's the real

1002
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:11,551
Makes way more sense

1003
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:21,023
Why I why I think that might be the case

1004
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,583
He's never going to.

1005
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,983
And we still have no idea for another year

1006
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,591
You know how when you do an experiment sometimes you will learn what doesn't create

1007
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,127
Fire

1008
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
Find out to chemical explosion

1009
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
It's not so much

1010
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Do you know what this is

1011
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
He's as much as it is like it's

1012
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
Method

1013
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,047
We've knocked out a couple of possibilities

1014
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,655
We had a good we had a good day

1015
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
Information to leave

1016
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Just be like

1017
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Any of those things are possible

1018
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
But we'll see

1019
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
Because Alex is so pissed off

1020
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
That Chuck Norris is on his show

1021
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,831
If you goes out to break Alex accidentally called Chuck Norris Glenn Beck

1022
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
What's that more about setting your new book

1023
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,751
Rebecca Glen Norah's over here whatever this

1024
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
Patriotism

1025
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,199
You can get the sense

1026
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
He's really

1027
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
He's not happy about this because

1028
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
This is supposed to

1029
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
To be a

1030
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
For him

1031
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:56,511
You got walk around the show man

1032
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,119
So they start talking about how Chuck Norris like

1033
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
Which I do want to get it

1034
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
Involved

1035
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Russian bass tab

1036
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,055
Income tax

1037
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,127
Property tax and stuff like that would go away

1038
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
And you just died as a lot of tax for buying

1039
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
That's kind of the idea

1040
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,527
This variations of the fairtax

1041
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,623
I will never not be surprised by how bad their ID

1042
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
I want Jessica

1043
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Consume

1044
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
Consuming

1045
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,351
And Alex

1046
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Glad

1047
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Bubba's 33

1048
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,295
Chuck Norris

1049
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Isn't insightful

1050
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,903
About the IRS

1051
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Taxation

1052
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,207
Retired bad news

1053
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Factor thing

1054
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
Is that the

1055
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,327
You know the IRS

1056
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
What was only became conch

1057
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,935
Institutional 1913

1058
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
The IRS

1059
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,495
Accident Constitution

1060
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Until 1913

1061
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,103
When the government when the congress met.

1062
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
Amendment

1063
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
Ever since that

1064
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:28,927
Yeah

1065
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,695
I got bad news

1066
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:36,351
Because it wasn't constitutional for women to vote until it was I mean what do you want to do

1067
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
What is this mean

1068
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:51,199
What is the Constitution

1069
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,759
It doesn't

1070
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,463
Constitutional before can never be constitutional

1071
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
Remember how that was written into the, man

1072
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,071
There definitely wasn't some sort of like

1073
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Okay

1074
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,935
Maybe we need some amendments to the Constitution maybe it's not

1075
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,471
What if we rode in

1076
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,007
An actual

1077
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,871
How to add

1078
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,711
Series of instructions are followed

1079
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
Institution

1080
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
That's so silly

1081
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
Glenn Beck

1082
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Comes up

1083
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
His love for him

1084
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,839
If you listen you can hear Alex get out in

1085
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,119
Exasperated sigh

1086
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
I get the answer

1087
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Supporter of Glenn Beck

1088
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
Consider him like you I like that really

1089
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,615
Are you a crusader Knight

1090
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
Considerate

1091
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
Later

1092
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,247
Because the whole thing is

1093
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Douching

1094
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
We're going to lose it

1095
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,487
The globalist have already hired Nick

1096
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,559
For a long time

1097
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
They had with a developer

1098
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,119
Deal to steal

1099
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,935
To Note 4

1100
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
Two-part series 0-2

1101
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
Chuck Norris

1102
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:27,455
Star of Texas Ranger is on the show and he's telling us they were going to lose our constitution is Glenbeigh

1103
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,903
Doesn't work

1104
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Douching

1105
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
It doesn't make me feel better when he says this about the concert

1106
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Diffusion

1107
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,303
You know what did John Adams do

1108
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
Second president

1109
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
Tuition was made only for a religion

1110
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
I really believe that

1111
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
Napoleon adequate

1112
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
The government

1113
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
Have any other

1114
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,847
Maintain our faith

1115
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
And I'm moral value

1116
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,455
Constitution

1117
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
Dissolving

1118
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Which

1119
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:06,367
Your Christian theocracy bro

1120
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Is that what you're into Walker

1121
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,911
Very much

1122
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,775
And John Adams saying that is exactly why we need them

1123
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
6th class

1124
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,151
Listening to Walker Texas Ranger be stupidest s***

1125
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
I just don't understand I just I don't get it

1126
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
I don't get it I don't get how anybody

1127
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
With a straight face

1128
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
Who seems to not be

1129
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
A monster

1130
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,695
Necessarily like I don't know any Chuck Norris is done

1131
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
Like this on the scale

1132
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,423
No no

1133
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,263
He could have killed a guy I have no idea guy

1134
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,359
The cure somebody who you do you assume

1135
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,431
Isn't a total monster saying like

1136
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
Wow

1137
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,295
The Constitutions really only for religious and moral

1138
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:11,903
People means that everyone must be religious

1139
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
If we're going to have this

1140
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
The Constitution doesn't apply to not religious

1141
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
Like a religious Folk

1142
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
So you don't either those conclusion

1143
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,143
Terrifying

1144
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:27,007
Means people of old

1145
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Immoral

1146
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,383
Follow their religion

1147
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
Tenants letter of the law

1148
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
I would assume so

1149
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
All religion

1150
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:47,743
The Constitution so much he remembers that in the First Amendment

1151
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:53,375
Sidekicks

1152
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
If Chuck is Chuck Norris wear a dictator

1153
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
Do you need a psychic

1154
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,055
Have you talked about him in this next

1155
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,871
This doesn't make me more interested in his version of government

1156
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
So you don't

1157
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
Saying I don't know if I told you

1158
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
Anyway

1159
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,951
Glitter floating around for the last two years haha

1160
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Peter Schiff

1161
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
If that was true

1162
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
I would go to watch

1163
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Congress

1164
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,471
And I'd have Ron Paul who I

1165
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
Play playlist the most honor

1166
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,775
Member of Congress

1167
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Point out

1168
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
Be honest

1169
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:44,319
Walking down the road

1170
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Aptoide

1171
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
And I'd say

1172
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
You're fired

1173
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
And if you didn't move immediately

1174
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
I took him unconscious

1175
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
Nancy Pelosi

1176
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
Nancy

1177
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
You're fired

1178
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:04,287
All the Time in the World to leave hahaha

1179
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,823
Can we just

1180
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:12,479
I don't know how I would say

1181
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,295
Person in the senate or whatever is that he says

1182
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:19,135
I didn't mean the first person

1183
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
You know

1184
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,975
I remember all of the sexes

1185
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
Successful government that were room

1186
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,631
That way right

1187
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:48,831
I'm trying to bring Liberty

1188
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:54,207
Division of a dictatorship

1189
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,535
Who can cover

1190
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,119
That's crazy

1191
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,935
Is I would hire Ron

1192
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:13,407
Chuck Norris himself is the Executioner

1193
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,759
I would like to go on the record I do not want

1194
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,367
I feel like a

1195
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:27,487
All the Amendments would disappear we would end up

1196
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,839
So much like Alec presented the miac report

1197
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Gold

1198
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
Pizza Hut

1199
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
In place for Bob Chapman he was earlier on

1200
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
On the show

1201
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Now that Chuck Norris is on

1202
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,567
I'm sorry that he doesn't say anything about the karate in

1203
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
Feel this isn't information

1204
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
Revolution

1205
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,343
I have the government documents I have the secret State Police reports that the feds give them

1206
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
This is what the Hydra

1207
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Mainline

1208
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:28,159
Libertarians and

1209
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
Yeah I know

1210
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:43,519
Like you Chuck Norris Chuck Norris need the hardcore

1211
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:49,919
True that I'm bringing cuz you're in danger report is about you Chuck Norris

1212
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
Report

1213
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,807
Chuck Norris why the f*** are you talking to Glenn Beck

1214
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,599
And the other thing that is

1215
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Really really funny

1216
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
This because I just assumed it was

1217
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,559
But Alex has another

1218
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
Manual

1219
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
Vapes

1220
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Hueytown

1221
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Is proof

1222
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,423
That that the government

1223
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,191
Just trying to crack

1224
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,263
They hate these are the Patriots and all that

1225
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,567
Him

1226
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,335
Believe

1227
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:22,687
I don't exactly know they came from

1228
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
But it came from I know

1229
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,295
In Arizona law in for

1230
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
I believe it was a guy named Jack

1231
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,391
Glam is coming up later on the show but

1232
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
But I can't prove it

1233
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,695
What's the timeline matches up

1234
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,231
But I went and looked at it

1235
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Supplier

1236
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Flyers

1237
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
Play folded in half

1238
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
And it's just giving law enforcement

1239
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Things to look out

1240
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
It's actually better

1241
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,567
Like I said

1242
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,847
Description

1243
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
And based on the study

1244
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,407
But they've done

1245
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
This one if you open up the

1246
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,295
You look inside and it has a list

1247
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,599
Two things used to be on the lookout for

1248
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,623
There's two

1249
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
Did you want to look out for

1250
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,255
It isn't quote in the dark

1251
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,327
Defenders of the US Constitution against

1252
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,375
Foreign governments and the UN

1253
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,399
Parenthetically

1254
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Super Paper

1255
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,775
And groups of individuals engaged in paramilitary train

1256
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,359
You should definitely be looking out

1257
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,455
If you were in law enforcement

1258
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,759
Conceivably could be concerned about

1259
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,575
If someone engaging paramilitary training

1260
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Is really

1261
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,695
I don't want

1262
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
But that usually doesn't happen in balance

1263
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:45,119
People with a good head on their shoulders generally aren't in the woods training for war

1264
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
On their own

1265
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:50,239
Demi Moore in a cell

1266
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Together

1267
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,311
Who are

1268
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
Sickly consistent with

1269
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,663
And they learn how to use weapons

1270
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
The practice

1271
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
Necessary

1272
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,831
Neutralize

1273
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
The anime

1274
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:10,975
Do you know they're never going to use those

1275
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:17,375
And they'll never manufacturer enemies real or imagined

1276
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,983
Right and it'll never take that anime is real or imagined

1277
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,567
Kind of blow it out of proportion and then turn it into a local issue

1278
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
They would never

1279
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
The tution against

1280
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
The federal government

1281
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Anime

1282
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,111
You should be concerned about 2

1283
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Because that is

1284
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Upsetting

1285
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
You know what I mean

1286
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:47,327
People who don't think that the constitution

1287
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
I mean that's Alex's

1288
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,191
Well I would still believe

1289
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Right-wing extremist

1290
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
Now you go down

1291
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Is neo-Nazi

1292
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Black separatist

1293
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
Those are all groups

1294
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
You should be aware of

1295
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:13,183
Enforcement are generally some groups or maybe do a crime or two

1296
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
Open

1297
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,535
Common-law movement per pound

1298
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
Oh yeah

1299
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,935
Maybe didn't have that name

1300
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Fictitious license

1301
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
Plates no license plates

1302
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Pictures of driver's life

1303
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
No driver's license

1304
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Refusing to identify

1305
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,687
Themselves

1306
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Request why are you stop

1307
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,039
Make a numerous references to the US,

1308
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,855
Institution

1309
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
Police the police

1310
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,047
Those are the things you should look out for

1311
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Send it to you

1312
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,119
You might be talking to a common-law

1313
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Moon

1314
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
Maritime law kind of guy the least

1315
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
Play version of Jeff

1316
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,543
Then there's single-issue terrorist

1317
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,247
Terrorist Urban Riot educators

1318
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,295
Find to everybody else

1319
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
Doomsday

1320
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
Sure

1321
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,951
Weapons of mass destruction is on here

1322
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:24,351
Don't need to tell us to look out for that

1323
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,983
And then also there's a little section like this

1324
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
Cartoon

1325
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,543
Giant

1326
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Just being like

1327
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
So you going to use that

1328
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:43,807
Constitutional

1329
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,695
You love so much

1330
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:51,999
That is a problem

1331
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Left

1332
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,399
Political motivation

1333
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,703
Is usually marxist-leninist philosophy

1334
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Now

1335
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,007
Hi

1336
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,031
I'm not an idiot

1337
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
And I say

1338
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:10,431
You know what there probably are some left-wing groups that have marxist-leninist philosophy

1339
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,247
In no way do I look at that and say

1340
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,783
If you are into marks

1341
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,063
You're into Lennon

1342
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,111
Then that means

1343
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,975
That would be how I would have to read it if I was playing the same stupid games Alex

1344
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:26,047
Picture that I wanted to bring

1345
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
Is there's a bad luck

1346
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:32,191
Terrorism is included in Paradise

1347
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
People for the most part

1348
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
There's a small part about right-wing

1349
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
Extremism

1350
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,103
He ignores all the rest of this

1351
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,663
In order to be like they're trying to

1352
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
The Patriots

1353
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
I can play the same game with you like they're trying to

1354
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
Do you understand

1355
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
He would have just as much

1356
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,231
Validity using this Ark

1357
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
Using this

1358
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
How to spell

1359
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
Stupid

1360
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,839
Anyway

1361
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
In case anybody was

1362
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Turns out

1363
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:05,215
Here's where I get a little bit of empathy

1364
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:05,983
C4 Chuck Norris

1365
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,799
Okay so the interview ends

1366
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
How fast

1367
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,383
As soon as Chuck Norris is gone

1368
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Alex starts

1369
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
Condescending

1370
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,223
Keep creating going buddy

1371
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
Analyze This

1372
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Go to the military

1373
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:50,527
Destroyed

1374
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,887
He supports the state sovereignty movement you just heard that

1375
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
That's sad

1376
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:23,295
MeetMe

1377
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Volunteers

1378
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Restart

1379
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
Keep rambling from there

1380
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,375
I think it's really fun no just being like

1381
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:51,711
Cuz he's hanging out with Glenn Beck was not a c student

1382
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,015
One point or another

1383
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,575
Soundly patronizing

1384
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,647
I can't imagine North wasn't still listening

1385
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:08,863
Has anyone heard that been like

1386
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,263
Almost immediately after

1387
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,615
Rather than angry at you for mentioning Glenn Beck

1388
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
Repeatedly

1389
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,223
Repeatedly

1390
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,783
To promote his appearance

1391
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,599
Chucky

1392
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:33,695
You would have no idea why Alex was just

1393
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,767
Call the sudden

1394
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:43,679
Yeah now it's called him sir and it's nice to his face and was like

1395
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,519
. my gut tells me he's a good guy but he doesn't know much

1396
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,311
Now

1397
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Shity

1398
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,431
Another

1399
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
Comes up after Chuck Norris

1400
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Mcclam

1401
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,879
He's a former police guy from

1402
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,463
From Phoenix Arizona

1403
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,071
Realtor

1404
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,607
This guy

1405
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Is it on

1406
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:18,495
Not necessarily

1407
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
It's worth mentioning

1408
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
He sounds a lot like

1409
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
Chuck Norris

1410
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
In Atherton

1411
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
Yes we sure are a brother

1412
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,463
We're getting more and more

1413
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,535
Email I get 200 300 a day and then

1414
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,071
That's nothing to what you get but

1415
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
Soldiers

1416
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,655
Other people in

1417
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,751
It's fantastic how more

1418
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Time

1419
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
And I've been praying every night

1420
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,079
That God would give us

1421
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
Second chance

1422
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,407
Oh and forgive our night

1423
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,759
Sam's for throwing him out of this nation and allow it to go forward

1424
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
F*** are you talking about

1425
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,903
Commandments and his laws and throughout these evils

1426
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:14,559
He literally

1427
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,631
It's heard that last part you said throw out

1428
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
Evil man's laws

1429
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:25,567
This constitution bolted advocating for Christians

1430
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,847
Theocracy Broadway

1431
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:33,503
Lean and doors

1432
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
Describe

1433
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,159
Almost exactly

1434
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,463
Playwright

1435
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,767
Is the false Christianity

1436
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,119
Acclaimed appearance on the show

1437
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,471
Not aware of

1438
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
About The Oath Keepers

1439
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,127
This great cool new group of kids

1440
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,407
Out on the scene

1441
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:06,271
And you know what they're all about

1442
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
I like to keep a nose

1443
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,647
Could you make a note

1444
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,463
They sound eminently reasonable Dan I assume there

1445
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,511
No other details to learn about them

1446
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,143
I just keep up I'm saving getting into them for another day because I'm going to go Whole Hog

1447
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
And the reason for that

1448
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:34,687
Is Arab military is because

1449
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,759
He was talking about

1450
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Glenn Beck

1451
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,319
912

1452
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
Visibly and audibly

1453
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Put off by

1454
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,815
But also I think there might be a piece of his mind that was like

1455
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
Because

1456
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,423
When Jack McLamb comes on

1457
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,959
He starts talking about

1458
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
10 things

1459
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,847
That I Hate About You

1460
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
Keepers have like

1461
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
We will not take away people's guns

1462
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,783
Guys they love

1463
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,599
Jack McLamb spend 40 minutes

1464
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,879
Breaking down

1465
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
The rules

1466
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,583
40 minute break

1467
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,447
I meant to go to Commercial and I was like

1468
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,007
Those all again but I'm going to editorialize

1469
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,799
Everyone will talk about it

1470
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,847
He's like

1471
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,599
Really really excited about these 10

1472
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,391
Rules of those keepers

1473
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
They make Smith

1474
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
Take that he's going

1475
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Full auto

1476
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:57,887
These guys never talked about the beatitude like there's never a

1477
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,239
Treat others the way you want to be treated there's none of that stuff it's always like

1478
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
If you have the chance

1479
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,431
Sure

1480
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,967
Now just because

1481
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
I needed a little bit of

1482
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,183
I decided to check a little bit

1483
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,511
But I don't know I don't know how much we talk about I know we haven't talked about there

1484
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
I found a video

1485
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,631
But he has put out of his radio show

1486
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,935
He put out a

1487
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,519
List the episode of his radio show called was Hitler upon

1488
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:40,127
Which interesting Lee relates back to a bunch of stuff Alex was talking about earlier

1489
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
Here's the quote

1490
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:45,503
From that video

1491
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,087
What's that one go

1492
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:53,439
You can't because you can't cuz your butthole into all of these

1493
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Basically Nazi adjacent

1494
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
Anti-communist propaganda

1495
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:02,655
A propaganda sooner or later you're going to have to run into the problem of

1496
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
If all of the guys that I like

1497
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
Are telling the truth

1498
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:11,359
That means Hitler can't be a bad guy about it like

1499
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,407
Intelligence sources

1500
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
Very happy quotes

1501
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,015
Bilderberg Group

1502
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
For the spotlight

1503
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,391
Which was the publication put out

1504
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,207
Specifically in order to turn public opinion against

1505
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,047
Great-grand worldview

1506
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,607
About

1507
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
It goes on to this day

1508
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,703
In the CFR at all this s***

1509
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,983
It's based on

1510
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
A mist

1511
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,615
5 W Cleon skousen that was published and promoted

1512
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:47,967
By the Liberty Lobby they would put out there put together by Willis carto

1513
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,527
Who wanted to demonize Jews

1514
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
And all of that ends up

1515
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:56,415
Being mixed into a big bouillabaisse that ends up

1516
01:19:57,695 --> 01:20:00,767
It's alphabet.

1517
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,447
You were too young to understand what you were reading

1518
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
And you have a family that is for

1519
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,311
Probably a little bit crazy

1520
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
To be like

1521
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
Alex

1522
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,640
Has never had

1523
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,408
Crisis

1524
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,688
A political identity

1525
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,016
He's had this stupid world you since he was 12

1526
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:26,880
Like someone who's walked around and never had to question actually what he believed

1527
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,464
10 reading these dumb book

1528
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
Being challenged by the experiences

1529
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
But he has in the world

1530
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
He gets defensive about them and yells

1531
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,680
In order to be like no I'm going to

1532
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,752
Vociferously defend my opinion as opposed to

1533
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,312
Consider the possibility maybe I'm wrong

1534
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,712
Wish that we lived in a world where if you started digging into your philosophy

1535
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,248
And you eventually

1536
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Defend

1537
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,320
Hitler as your as your bedroom

1538
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:00,416
Better be like Hitler

1539
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,720
Maybe I should dig myself out of this hole

1540
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
But with these guys there's just nobody

1541
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:13,216
What else we got part of the mentality because

1542
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
If everything is

1543
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Nothing is what

1544
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,360
You thought it is

1545
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
Yeah he didn't do it

1546
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,736
What Hitler upon

1547
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,040
Festival

1548
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600
That's the video that was put out by

1549
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
Jack McLean

1550
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:31,904
Here's the quote

1551
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:38,560
Was Hitler upon this is fascinating so I wanted to share this with you because it's by one of my

1552
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,680
One of my favorite jeans in the world

1553
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,776
One of my favorite in the world Henry Makow

1554
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,848
Jordan Henry Mack h a noted lunatic

1555
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Conspiracy theories

1556
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,200
It's also worth pointing out that

1557
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
Weird

1558
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,040
Amongst

1559
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:12,608
Is there a

1560
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:17,216
Beatles were in Illuminati

1561
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,752
Interesting late

1562
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,408
He wrote a book in 2000 called

1563
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,736
Blurb of the book from Amazon

1564
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,624
In the Philippines Henry Makow 48 discovered a Tropical Paradise where women are still traditional

1565
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
And the husband is the head of the household

1566
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,072
In marriage to a young Filipino

1567
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,216
Nothing like an uplifting story of an ear fifty-year-old Man flying to Southeast Asia to marry an 18 year old

1568
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:59,456
Gensol

1569
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:05,856
I like

1570
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:14,048
The reviews on his his

1571
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Tibetana

1572
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:20,704
I also recommend reading this book to anyone who finds themselves sympathetic to Macos views on his website

1573
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,032
It's the perfect antidote because it's painfully obvious

1574
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,312
The problem a cow has

1575
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,080
The world is a

1576
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,104
Actually

1577
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,408
I understand people

1578
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,968
Socially unacceptable

1579
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,064
There's nothing wrong with an Intercultural marriage orientee traditional role

1580
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
But the combination of

1581
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,880
Property a 30-year age Gap

1582
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
The three-week courtship is a bridge too far

1583
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:53,728
Lincoln

1584
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:58,080
Because they were getting a real money over throw the Illuminati

1585
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Control the money

1586
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:02,432
He also believes it was the Jews that were to blame for the Holocaust

1587
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
He's Jack McLamb

1588
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Favorite Jew

1589
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
Just

1590
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
Don't want to die

1591
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
Historically it's a bad idea.

1592
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,328
If that person is a white nationalist

1593
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,424
A lot of the argument is to lay out in this Holocaust

1594
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,704
Denying

1595
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
From a 1941 publication

1596
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
Quote I was Hitler's book

1597
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,360
Written anonymously at

1598
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,920
The time we now know was written by Captain Karl Mayer

1599
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,760
This is proof that there was someone as he sure point

1600
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,040
The mayor is Jewish

1601
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:41,344
Who is pulling Hitler strings in the Holocaust

1602
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:45,952
The problem is that mayor was only Hitler's immediate supervisor

1603
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,000
20 when Hitler was a general staff

1604
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,840
This guy is a good here before you become fewer than

1605
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,400
Before he became Chancellor of Durham

1606
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
Fun fact

1607
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
Power mayor flood

1608
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,800
Sprint rewards with anti-nausea for

1609
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,896
Buchenwald

1610
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,176
Concentration camp

1611
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,224
Interesting Lee

1612
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,528
If you do read the article I was Hitler's boss

1613
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,320
You see from striking parallels

1614
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:15,392
77 years later

1615
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,488
The leaders knew that to please the majority and minority must suffer

1616
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,536
German Jews were made

1617
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:25,120
Cheap scapegoats because their destruction would gain millions of votes for the knot

1618
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,704
Small shopkeepers hated Jews because they owned a chain stores

1619
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,240
Farmers with Wister destruct

1620
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
Because they were indebted

1621
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
Jewish Bank

1622
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Even intellectuals were jealous

1623
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,104
Because juice help lucrative position

1624
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,128
The Arts and Science

1625
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,152
Professions

1626
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,712
The Nazi salesman offered anything and everything

1627
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,992
Thing to make the people warmind

1628
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,808
They're still talk was Germany as a have not come

1629
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,368
Other nations have all the wealth Germany

1630
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,904
Fight them successfully

1631
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440
I'd still be entitled to that well

1632
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,976
The Patriotic slogan

1633
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,536
Everything for Germany with nothing more than salesman

1634
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,840
No one cared in the least what would happen to

1635
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,608
The rest of Germany

1636
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,912
So long as the result via restoration

1637
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Of the good old

1638
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,776
The further argument laid out in the pieces that Hitler was

1639
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:05,056
Booty idiot

1640
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:08,384
And the bad guy when there was a supervisor

1641
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,784
And in fact the article ends with mayor laying out exactly what he

1642
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
He's talking about

1643
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:21,440
He's arguing that Hermann Goering is the real brains of the operation and the Hitler was a charismatic frontman sales man

1644
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
That they needed

1645
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
Pictures of Harley from Jackman

1646
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Glammed

1647
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Shocking parallel

1648
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
To our world

1649
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,776
The government wasn't

1650
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,736
So not necessarily A

1651
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,272
Controlling him so much as

1652
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,088
President with advice

1653
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,696
Bush was in office of Karl Rove Bush's brain

1654
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
If you think

1655
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,560
Eid of it

1656
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,144
People have influenced way over the even addictive

1657
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
You think that's weird

1658
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:08,032
0 childish fool if you believe

1659
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
You know

1660
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,176
I don't know I don't know what else to say other than that

1661
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
We have an account

1662
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,760
1841

1663
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,064
This guy very clearly explaining

1664
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
The Nazi

1665
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Ended up

1666
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,464
Solidifying a lot of their control

1667
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
The small group

1668
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
People and kept

1669
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
People warm

1670
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:37,984
There's going to be a civil war

1671
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,176
LGBT community and

1672
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:52,576
Is basically trying erase their identity

1673
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:57,696
Hanover the majority of minority has two separate analysis provider which one

1674
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,232
Now the difference here

1675
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,816
Is it the majority is going to suffer

1676
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,864
In order for the minority

1677
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
To solidify their power

1678
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Power

1679
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
So

1680
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
That's going to be fun

1681
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
Anyway

1682
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:19,968
Chronicling the rise of the Nazi party

1683
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
Real-time

1684
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,064
Surprise

1685
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
Saw this

1686
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,416
I think you can understand now why this episode was a little bit

1687
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:34,304
Call because we have this historical revision of Hitler being

1688
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
Completely unrelated to that we have

1689
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:39,680
Clearly the Holocaust denier

1690
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
You see so much of it

1691
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,264
And there's little things that I didn't expect

1692
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,104
I mean this guy does Henry Mack out going to

1693
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,384
The Philippines get a lady

1694
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,456
Other reviews Carnival fundera

1695
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,528
Distraction maybe not so fun to that lady

1696
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,600
But like reading is I was Hitler's book

1697
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
You know stuff

1698
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:07,584
It's very it's very difficult to see this

1699
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:12,192
From 9 years ago being very much

1700
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,592
And now we seem to cruelty in the sort of the Mask

1701
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
Coming off

1702
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:23,200
It makes you wonder how much of that was already there

1703
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
How much

1704
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Like

1705
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,272
To say how much

1706
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Turnpoint

1707
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,928
Was he just having more fun back then

1708
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
And

1709
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
Not as

1710
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,256
Beaked out on his own

1711
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,584
Is there a chance really the only fundamental

1712
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
A couple of these policies

1713
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:52,640
In favor of Palestinian clearly

1714
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,408
Fascist dictator

1715
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:00,064
Part of being part of a fascist dictatorship

1716
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
Party

1717
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:05,440
Is going along with whatever it is

1718
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
Read the

1719
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,816
Rise of stalinism

1720
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
Complete destruct

1721
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,912
Action of reality even for people with it

1722
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,752
Inner Circle whatever ideas

1723
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,032
Subsumed by whatever

1724
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:24,640
That's true even in a best-case

1725
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,944
Just had those inclinations and maybe they were late

1726
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,248
I can come to the surface and tell

1727
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,136
I barely got the baby it was one of those situations

1728
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
You have

1729
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,208
A gene that isn't Express

1730
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:41,280
Stimulus

1731
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
It's weird

1732
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,608
It was really difficult and it you know

1733
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,168
Is a lot of reading is difficult

1734
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,448
Figure out like Howard

1735
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,496
What is this say

1736
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,312
I don't know I don't have a full conclusion other than to say like

1737
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
What are constantly evolving

1738
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,992
And we can guarantee 100%

1739
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,296
Alex was around Indy rise of

1740
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:07,392
Do you like wholehearted

01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:19,424

Scrum

1745
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,248
You know 40

1746
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,272
60

1747
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,064
Even into the 70

1748
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,136
All are all that is where he gets all

1749
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,440
And it's unfortunate

1750
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
But it is real

1751
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,256
Most of those people

1752
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,304
Have deep roots

1753
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,632
So does that make Alex

1754
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912

Look

1763
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
I don't know

1764
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,136
I don't know

1765
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,160
But I do know

1766
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,208
I dunno.

1767
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,000
He probably killed

1768
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
Alex
