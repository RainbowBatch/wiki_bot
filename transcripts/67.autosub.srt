00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:08,704
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,104
To knowledge sightmd

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,176
Novelty beverage

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,224
This week because

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
4 hours in

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:26,112
Three bottles of wine later remember my own name

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,208
It was a necessary break from reality perhaps but that's not sad

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,280
Let's not kid ourselves were much better with Faygo

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
Faygo cream soda in honor of the jug of America

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,336
We have become juggalo

11
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:51,968
This is all Madness all the time I don't even have time to look at the news without

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
It's insanity

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,880
It's crazy everything is gone now it's backwards and now we're living through the worst of it

14
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,976
It's very well bus

15
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,768
Quite frankly

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
How else

17
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
This is kind of the point

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,664
If we normalizing we stopped fighting against

19
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
But at the same time it's like what

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Do you do

21
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,976
Like it like the idea of waiting to the 2018 midterms

22
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
World's Fair election

23
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Gerrymandering

24
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,384
Jack Ross Jack that's absolute

25
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,040
Play the play the outro

26
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,648
I think we can do at least you and I we can donate to causes

27
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
We can

28
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
Call senators and hope that helps

29
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,328
I think it's proven that calling Senators is b*******

30
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,496
And just s*** on their lawn if you have time to go for it

31
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Shiting on Senator Orrin hatch's

32
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
If you have time feel free to do that but if you don't

33
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,480
Help help

34
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
So

35
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,416
Mail them

36
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
That'd be great

37
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
32b some Middle Ground between

38
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Weeding

39
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
Extreme of like

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
There used to be a capitol building

41
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
There's something in the middle and I think

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
That's the only idea I have right off again if you have the time

43
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,392
Senators house

44
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Some of us have to go to work

45
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
Anyway

46
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Alright

47
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Let's find them

48
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
S*** on the donator

00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
God I love your transition love to give a shout in a welcome aboard

50
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040

New policy walk status Alex we love you

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
Tell everyone at the bars at House Parties

53
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,168
The user are the most boring person in the world

54
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
Tell everybody to know all about the intricacies

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Describe how many times I've gotten laid

56
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
Absolutely it's Street

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,232
So Jordan today we're going to be doing a very

58
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Special episode

59
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Defend

60
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
My assertion

61
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
That Alex Jones

62
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
Is largely basing his world 2 on the widely discredited

63
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Forgery

64
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,311
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

65
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,151
Iowa

66
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
What we believe

67
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,087
Yes but it is kind of a b a b of a

68
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,415
To make a number of times on the show

69
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
I just got to and I want

70
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
I don't want our listeners to go read that book

71
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,119
It's a waste of your time and it's full of b*******

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
But I

73
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
At the same time recognize that we are making

74
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
He's playing tonight really

75
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Literally back in them up

76
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
That's what I intend to do

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
Right it's kind of bulshit thing for us to take notes

78
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Six months ago saying

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,807
He loves the protocol and all this s***

80
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
A couple weeks back.

81
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
Alex Jones of Robert David Steele

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Yes I recall

83
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
The claim of the globalist

84
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Have a Mars colony

85
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Which they take

86
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Babies to be slaves

87
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Cuz they can't get back

88
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
And those Mars colony they're stuck there and now they're enslaved

89
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
By the rich

90
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Mars globalist

91
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
So which is a proven strategy for white people for a long

92
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
Going to space back

93
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
That's wild

94
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
That claim

95
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Is pretty wild

96
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
In the Fallout from that

97
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Everybody started clowning on out

98
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,887
Alex Jones thinks there's Mars bases

99
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Which he flatly denies although we found clips

100
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
But

101
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
She started to say

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
That the globalist

103
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
Set him up by Robert peel

104
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
But he came on to show to discredit

105
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
They're starting to be cracked within the Alex Jones Roberts

106
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Steel universe

107
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Deception already there

108
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Is well so happen to the aftermath of this

109
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
Is that Robert David

110
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Steel

111
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Went on

112
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Project Camelot

113
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
Also

114
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,311
We've got her name wrong every set it

115
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,479
Callahan

116
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
I don't even know this

117
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
I will tell you what this interview was all about on the other side of this clip

118
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
But I think it's important

119
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Interesting

120
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
To hear how Roberts

121
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Steel start visitor

122
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,887
When I'm sure Cassidy from Project Camelot

123
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,519
And I am here with Robert Steele and we are doing a very unusual

124
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,663
Robert takeover so go ahead Robert

125
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,807
Kerry Cassidy

126
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,951
I have seen all of those who have slandered you if I have been slandered recently by designer

127
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
Stewie

128
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
You may need

129
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
You made no

130
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
Sign of being surprised by Robert David Steele blaming design

131
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
At what else is he going to do

132
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,055
I've seen the way that you carry Cassidy and I now

133
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Have been attacked by the Zionist

134
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,503
Cassidy usually I don't mind

135
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Regularly

136
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
Enough to know where her head is on the whole thing but I definitely

137
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,143
She says is wacky b*******

138
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
So I think that's what's going on

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:13,567
No I don't think that's her cosmology I think that's Robert Steele

140
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,895
Okay and he's bringing it into her being like just like you have

141
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm in the same boat now cuz I went crazy

142
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
The Zionist

143
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
Who are setting me up because I'm telling the truth

144
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
Am I girl

145
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Play EverQuest

146
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
In the history of the world

147
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
So believe whatever you tell her

148
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
When is the Robert Steele

149
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Interviews

150
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,103
Kerry Cassidy about the secret space program

151
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
Interview

152
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
I'm trying to do this it's terrible

153
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
Is that the Nazis

154
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
From Project Paperclip

155
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
Program

156
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Good people

157
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
They create super soldiers and numbers of tens of

158
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Most likely

159
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,359
There's all that sort of standard talked about super soldiers on the last Project Camelot

160
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Which is great

161
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
One of the new Revelations that we find

162
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
Is Vietnam

163
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh there we go now when this was not about communist

164
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Okay we're start

165
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Was Vietnam about communism

166
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
What's North Vietnamese Menace

167
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
The Communist Menace

168
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,423
Yeah but I mean

169
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
I'm just worried about rich people get rich

170
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Outlook

171
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:53,151
Whatever layer you want on some level the media told people it was a bad cop

172
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
So

173
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
What did media would dare tell you

174
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Is it the truth is that there were Stargate

175
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
They're also Stargates in Iraq

176
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
And that's why the Iraq War happened

177
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Because

178
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
Saddam Hussein

179
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Was going to

180
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
Allow in alien races through that

181
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
That portal

182
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
But he had

183
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
But we have to shut that couch

184
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Classic sedan

185
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
That is classic

186
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
If there's one thing I know about autocratic dictators

187
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
They love letting in Alien

188
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Just like ours

189
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
Power

190
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
What the f***

191
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
What about Korea

192
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Probably

193
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
The explanation for all of America's War

194
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,423
Mostly it is 100%

195
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
I was like this is Wile

196
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
I've got to look into this more

197
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Where does

198
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
Where is she getting this that the Vietnam was about Stargate

199
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
With a soldier who was in Vietnam

200
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Who would get been getting hypnotic regression

201
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
With a therapist

202
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
She

203
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
He asserts

204
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Vietnam

205
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
He was fighting Giant Beetle

206
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
So right

207
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
Do you know what their names are

208
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
That's why it was

209
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,407
Was called the Tet Offensive

210
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
And there was a mass hallucination

211
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Remember that

212
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
Only through hypnotic

213
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Can you recall that the text

214
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,535
What were the Beatles

215
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Strategic

216
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Sanford

217
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
Vicious Critters

218
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
Like wow

219
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,711
She's basing all of this on an interview that she

220
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,063
Who has PTSD I feel really bad for him but I don't want to make fun of him

221
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,391
He's doing the best he can

222
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
Hypnotherapist who's also in the interview

223
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
I start to get the sense that maybe this is about her

224
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Vietnam

225
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
You think it might be about a little bit

226
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
So

227
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
I was like Jesus Christ

228
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
This is this is the wildest s***

229
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
She's referencing this interview that you did it while she's talking with Robert Steele

230
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
The Robert Steele

231
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
You're the best you're doing the best work you're amazing

232
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
He believed the wars have been over Stargate

233
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
And Alex Jones as a guest

234
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
On his show

235
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Repeatedly

236
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
This wasn't the first time he was on you stalking about Mars

237
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Alex

238
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Either doesn't know what his gas to believe

239
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Or doesn't care that this guy is

240
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Certifiably nuts

241
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Do any of these people

242
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
I know I feel like

243
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Steel

244
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
Well yeah but you're not one of those people

245
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Welfare

246
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
Doesn't actually believe in

247
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Stargates or whatever it is

248
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Callahan

249
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
Call

250
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
So they just

251
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Greenway

252
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
And forth by like

253
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
She says the s*** she wants

254
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Never the twain shall meet

255
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,759
There is some of that that's probably a fair assessment opportunity to

256
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Say like

257
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
You got the dumb Alex

258
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Your tax guys are coming talk about

259
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
He's been in prison for 20 years

260
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
Do you think it's a f****** setup

261
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
You believe all this

262
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Do some f****** leg work

263
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
Wesley Snipes should go on the shown be like Texas or Eve

264
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Yeah absolutely

265
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
So

266
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
That was a little bit of fun now Jordan let's get

267
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,415
The protocol I wish I had

268
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
What do you know about these your protocols

269
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
I don't know anything

270
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Nothing

271
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Not the same

272
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
I guess so

273
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,775
Now we can do the now we can do the intro

274
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,127
This is a podcast for Dan knows everything about the

275
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
The protocols of the elders

276
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
So what to do on this episode

277
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,927
If I had more time to plan what I would have done

278
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Is I would have taken a bunch of past

279
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
Messages from

280
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

281
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
And a bunch

282
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Quotes

283
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
From Alex

284
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
Yes and I would have had you

285
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,287
And I don't think you'll be able to tell a number of them apart

286
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
Okay because I didn't have that kind of time

287
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
I just have

288
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
A bunch of packages that I found

289
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
From reading

290
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Burgos builders

291
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
I've read it before in the past

292
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
But going through

293
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Is

294
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Not

295
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Alex Jones

296
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Baby-faced isn't

297
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Higher

298
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Philosophy on

299
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
The protocols

300
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Brett

301
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Tavolata

302
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
A lot of videos about the globalist come directly

303
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
And spiritually

304
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
From this

305
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
You believe that he is

306
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,199
Maybe and that he is most likely

307
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
And changed

308
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
From Zion

309
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
It's us

310
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Gotcha

311
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,511
I believe that is possibly true but another possibility is

312
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
If you dig into a number of

313
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Actually do

314
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Still says that he finds like

315
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Formative

316
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,519
A lot of those are inspired by protocol.

317
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
We need to Schartner

318
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
We're going to

319
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,223
Alright

320
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Conspiracy

321
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Exactly

322
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Himself has become a master

323
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
Is just shooting out the same ideas

324
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Is really recognizing

325
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
And where they come

326
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Form of this

327
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Paises the Mothership

328
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
The pig in the signals to the smallest

329
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Tips around

330
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
The Earth shirt

331
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Blowing

332
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Yeah

333
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
I suppose that's fair

334
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:57,855
So I do want also still get the caveat that I videos a lot of other

335
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
And same sources Betty get stuff from and this isn't

336
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Fully explanatory everything

337
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
But as we go along I think

338
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
Think you'll see many many very important

339
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
The protocols of the Elders of Zion First

340
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Appeared in print

341
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
In Russia

342
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
In 1903

343
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
There's subsequently reprinted in a book and

344
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
1905

345
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
In a book called The Great in the small and the antichrist

346
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
By Sergei Nila

347
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Immediately after that

348
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
Add this chapter from his book becomes a pimp

349
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
Widely distributed

350
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
At this point yes

351
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Very much so.

352
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
Azepam politicus widely

353
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Distributed

354
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Start to read

355
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
Start to heaven

356
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Artifact

357
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Most people believe

358
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
That

359
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
The actual writing of the protocols of the Elders of Zion

360
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Was done

361
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
By Russia

362
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Intelligence

363
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Or buy a like a

364
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Intelligence

365
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
They believe that it was a concerted effort

366
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
To demonize the population

367
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Right

368
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Are you really get deep into why

369
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,631
People do that sort of thing

370
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
It really goes back to the roots

371
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Which

372
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
I don't think this is the whole story

373
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,103
Well I believe the roots of

374
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Aasimar

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
You murderer

376
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Lord and savior

377
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Jesus Christ

378
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Total no

379
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
The roots of anti-Semitism go back to the fact that Christians

380
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
In the early days

381
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,439
We're unable to

382
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
User

383
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
They weren't able to loan money

384
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
It with interest

385
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
The only people who were able to do that we're Jews

386
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,727
Where the population are Leon

387
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
They were not allowed certain jobs they weren't allowed

388
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
That's the only way that they could make me

389
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Was to be

390
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Loan make loans

391
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Successful

392
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
And everyone got mad

393
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
I feel like you got to get out of our

394
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
Your pants like we've tried to force you into this box

395
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
And you succeeded in that box so f*** off can't got to go

396
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Leeds

397
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,287
Basic because of Bible

398
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
The thing that they profess to believe

399
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Have a history of Khan

400
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Hopefully getting kicked out of play

401
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,807
I want your new coming into a new place you're always looked at as differ

402
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
You're not looked at as the

403
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Local

404
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Rightful population of a place

405
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
So the entire history of the nomadic dates

406
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Throughout

407
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Various Nations the date

408
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Go to make a lot of money

409
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:55,775
Loan because that's what they have to do

410
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
Yeah quite a bit over the last three

411
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Right

412
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Where the cycle repeats

413
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Much more harshly reinforced

414
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
I already have the word from the other place

415
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
Place to get kicked out of

416
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Right

417
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
There is some of that

418
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,071
Over the course of history there's just been

419
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
A real black mark

420
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
On the Jewish population

421
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
It is unfair

422
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
I am usually

423
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
Like almost all the stuff you end up hearing

424
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,871
About populations are about legendary figures or mythology

425
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
From from way back

426
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
Thousand fifteen hundred years ago

427
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Idea of these like

428
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
Bad blood thirsty loan shark

429
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Is wildly overstated

430
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Just serve

431
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
To create a demon eyes population

432
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Cancel that

433
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Protocols in a lot of ways

434
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Coming to a head of it

435
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Thousand

436
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
Plus gear Factory

437
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Beating again

438
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
All Odds

439
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
So people

440
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Still hate because of

441
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Get mostly guy

442
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
Spider-Man that is a large

443
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,063
Portion of what the protocols talked about 2

444
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Frame

445
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
This

446
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
Money-grubbing

447
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,464
I hate that even feels dirty to say but like

448
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
That that sort of

449
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Mythologize nature

450
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
And they turn it into like

451
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
This is what they're playing all along

452
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Since way back is all their plan

453
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,008
Is this

454
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
And force them into a job thinking that it will never be

455
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
They were horribly segregated against then once

456
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
They figured out the

457
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
That thing they got segregated into was super successful

458
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
They bided their time and I have planned Revenge

459
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
Against

460
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,352
Well I mean I have a good case for

461
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,704
Like the entire thing we talked about about people really projecting what they think they deserve

462
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Yeah

463
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
So

464
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
This this

465
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Prim

466
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
I just kept on going

467
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
And this

468
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
This pamphlet comes out of becomes really popular

469
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
When asked

470
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
About where it came from

471
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
Like why did it get published

472
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
Every single story

473
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Changes

474
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
The years change

475
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
When this was supposed to happen

476
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
The years change

477
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
When

478
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,376
People came in

479
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
The possession of the original manuscript

480
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,240
The story of how it came to their hands like

481
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,336
Espionage and people breaking into the Jewish elders

482
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
Sanctum and stealing

483
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
It's not you know it's all again just mythologized garbage

484
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Stories

485
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Stories Keep Change

486
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,392
Just lends no credibility

487
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
Like it is Night tickets early night

488
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
1800 but that's not a time that we don't still have decent records

489
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,400
Yeah we have decent records from 300 BC

490
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Right

491
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,056
2019 22 Henry Ford published 500,000

492
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Copies of

493
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
The protocols of Elders of Zion

494
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
And he started

495
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:19,296
To repackage and publish them and articles in newspapers.

496
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
With titles like

497
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
The international Jew the world's foremost problem

498
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,464
Yeah so he just started to use it as really potent

499
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
Anti-semitic propaganda

500
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Around the same time

501
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Publishing

502
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
It comes out that it's a forge

503
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,216
It comes out that they are they have soundproof

504
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Researchers have found proof

505
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,872
Complete fraud and actually stolen from multiple pre

506
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Existing

507
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
Scott from documents that are very

508
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
Just ideas from them are package

509
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,112
Some paragraphs or even just stolen for

510
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Absolutely

511
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
As of this comes out but that does

512
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
Stop Henry Ford from

513
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Continuing

514
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Going to push it

515
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
SATs Medical

516
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
He even goes on to a verbal says about the same thing later

517
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,872
He goes both have very similar perspective

518
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
This text might be a forgery

519
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
But the ideas

520
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Contained inside of them are

521
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,576
True

522
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Is

523
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
I mean there's no way around that

524
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,096
I've been interesting because

525
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,680
Did I don't care if what I should be basing it on it's been debunked

526
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
No it's a Feeling

527
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
Dangerous

528
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Why not theism

529
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,152
Still has such a stronghold

530
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
Because we started

531
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Sure we started the knot

532
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
The 500,000 copies of this b*******

533
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
That the Jews are trying to take over the world will end up killing us

534
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,512
That's all they're all the goalie in the world

535
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
What is

536
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,608
Happening in America in 1920

537
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
So

538
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Great

539
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
America

540
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,384
Hitler was very inspired by the protocols of the elders believed in

541
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
To at least some extent

542
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
At least

543
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
Definitely

544
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Stop

545
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
That supported them

546
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Referred interesting Lee

547
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Two Jews as vamp

548
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Empires

549
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,304
Alex Jones does a lot

550
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,704
It is interesting to go back

551
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Juseword

552
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Right

553
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
That means Alex uses it in the context of

554
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Child molester the whole bunch

555
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
Sprite Hitler uses

556
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Suck

557
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:03,648
Kim's dry

558
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Except if you change the phrase

559
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
Step

560
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Like I said

561
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
In the twenties and

562
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Perhaps even a little bit

563
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Before that

564
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,960
People started to discover these very similar things

565
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
And other books

566
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
One of them

567
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,080
Main things that it's taken from

568
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Which is

569
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,992
It's an 1868

570
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Systematic German novelist Hermann

571
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
1068

572
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
There's a chapter in it

573
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
Titled in the Jewish cemetery

574
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
Salida

575
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Describes

576
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,096
A bunch of really powerful Jewish people getting together in a cemetery

577
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Plotting nefarious

578
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,984
Which is very very theme atticly similar to

579
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
A lot of it is Whole Hog

580
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
Repurpose

581
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
The other

582
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
Piece that is

583
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
Wiley

584
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Widely plagiarize

585
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Within protocol

586
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,112
Is a book called conversations in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu

587
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Came out in 1864

588
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
It is basically

589
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
Exactly what the title says it's

590
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Yeah it's just a dialogue

591
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
Inhale

592
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,120
Where Machiavelli argues

593
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
In favor of despot

594
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
You think the despotism is the way to go and people don't

595
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
Preserve the freedoms

596
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,592
Fanned on the side of liberal

597
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,648
So here here or a couple

598
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
I just side-by-side

599
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Comparison give you a sense

600
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,376
Reveille dialogue spoken by Machiavelli

601
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,728
Like the god Vishnu my press will have a hundred arms and his arms will give their hands

602
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,032
To all the different shades of opinion throughout the cow

603
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
Now here's from the protocols

604
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,664
These newspapers like the Indian God Vishnu will be possessed

605
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Hundreds of ham

606
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
Each will be feeling the pulse of various public

607
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Sounds like a bad book

608
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Absolutely

609
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
Like duet

610
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Citing Vishnu

611
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,952
Specifically

612
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
Hundreds of hand

613
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
It's all like that's

614
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Very clearly.

615
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:23,424
Machiavelli is talking about Vishnu in hell we got a lot more issues

616
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Sherp another one

617
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
This is Monty

618
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,360
I understand the figure of the god Vishnu

619
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Sufficient

620
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,968
You have 100 arms like the Indian Idol on each of your fingers touch

621
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
To the spring

622
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Arizona protocols

623
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
Our government will resemble the Hindu god Vishnu

624
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
Each of our hundred hands will hold one spring of the social Machinery of State

625
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm just very obvious that box

626
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Hey there

627
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Tons of examples

628
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,144
Direct rip-off

629
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
The dialogue in Hell between

630
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Machiavelli

631
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,544
Is not about

632
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Am I missing

633
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,944
Has to do with which way is better to sort of take over a country

634
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
Which is the preferred system

635
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,368
But so many of the ideas

636
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,648
Just repackaged

637
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Repurposed

638
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
Anti-Semitic

639
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Gotcha

640
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
I want at this point I hope

641
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
I don't know if I have

642
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,680
If you're interested you can do

643
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,704
Specifics

644
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
But it is a f****** forgery

645
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
It's been proven over and over again

646
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
And anyone who doesn't believe that doesn't want to believe it

647
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Right they feel

648
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
They have to be emotional hatred of Jews and they don't want to deal with

649
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Reality in order to

650
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
Kind of correct that

651
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:52,000
I do feel a little weird about the fact that I have the protocols of the Elders of Zion on my Kindle

652
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Yeah well your phone is a peasant

653
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,424
I will now begin our portion

654
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
The analysis

655
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
Of the protocols of the elders

656
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
The I like the officious

657
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,152
Nature of your words don't know how to do that

658
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
Motion

659
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Seconded

660
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:19,648
As my own motion do that all the way it's set up as an address

661
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,232
Speaker in the Tribunal

662
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,816
Do you learning Elders of Zion have gathered

663
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
Further meetings supposed to take

664
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Place

665
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
I believe in 90

666
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
1801

667
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
The case then

668
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
18

669
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
60 whatever

670
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
Free dating app

671
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Verydice

672
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
The year change

673
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,320
I think what it was they claimed

674
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,904
That it was from 1900 at turns out they met in 90

675
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
1801

676
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,000
I took the initial claim of when that came from could not have

677
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,072
Elders of Zion

678
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,144
No elders

679
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
Jewish organizations me

680
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:09,568
Williams Ian isn't was a thing back then like Theodor herzl has a book called The Jewish state

681
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
Also widely

682
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
Cited as an inspiration

683
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,504
Just a text

684
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
About how the Jews need their own state

685
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:26,208
Yeah because they've been everywhere

686
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:32,608
I'm not fully on board with I think that Israel has a problem

687
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
At the same time

688
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,032
Design isn't that existed in the early 1900s was not

689
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,104
The same thing that we associate Zionism with

690
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
Associate Zionism

691
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
As a term

692
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Jewish Supremacy

693
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
That is sort of the 121

694
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
Mental

695
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Thing that we make

696
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
Between those words

697
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,464
Zionism largely was

698
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,560
About we got a

699
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
24oz to be around

700
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
No matter

701
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,848
Yeah it's Cedarhurst.

702
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Came out in 8

703
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
1890

704
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
6

705
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,712
Conclusion of it

706
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Man

707
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
Any anything in German

708
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Jews

709
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Really bums me out

710
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
Not good not good I don't like hearing that

711
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:35,584
I believe that a wonder is generation of Jews will spring into existence

712
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,376
The Maccabee ends will rise again

713
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,680
Let me repeat once more my opening words

714
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
The wish for a state will have it

715
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:47,104
We shall live at last as freemen peacefully in our own home

716
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,432
The world would be freed by our Liberty and Rich by our well

717
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Magnified by our greatness

718
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
And whatever we attempt is there to accomplish for our own welfare

719
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
React PowerPlay in beneficial for the good of humanity

720
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
That's the sort of an encapsulated of what

721
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
This this

722
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,512
Theodor herzl Zionism

723
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,560
In the late 1800s

724
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
The maccabean

725
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
I'ma go today

726
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
What is a good

727
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
Aspiration

728
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,088
The Jewish people clearly didn't

729
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Someplace to be

730
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,208
Absolutely

731
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Treated as equal

732
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,024
Everybody's

733
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,304
And they don't get runoff

734
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
At the same time saying in like

735
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
This sort of Declaration

736
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Is what

737
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Anybody

738
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Recess

739
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
We deserve to be free the world will benefit from our freedom we will enrich Humanity

740
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,296
By whatever we are able to create

741
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:04,416
It's a positive message we f****** have it in our declaration

742
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,208
The world will be a better place

743
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
If you stop f***

744
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
With us and treat us like

745
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
Instead of taking that message

746
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
People got really mad

747
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Really scared

748
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
And started

749
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
King with them and not trade

750
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
Absolutely

751
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,056
This idea of the Jewish Council

752
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Meeting

753
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Comes

754
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,432
To be in this Protocols of the Elders of Zion it's one person

755
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Ostensibly

756
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Giving

757
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
A speech

758
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,320
About what has happened over the last hundred years

759
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,416
The plans that this Council has for the next hundred

760
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,720
What they're going to do to people

761
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
Got now I am just going to read you the things that I highlighted

762
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,472
I'll just let you respond to them

763
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
And also I reckon

764
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Nize that

765
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
In order for any of this to hit home

766
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
You have to have listened to

767
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,968
Or just

768
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,040
Apologizing

769
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,416
You're the first one so does seem like it's more for you

770
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,024
But it's like

771
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,168
You're you're doing this because it's like I need everybody to know that I'm not making this up

772
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,032
We're going to go through the f****** document we are

773
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
30 headlines on his headlines headlines

774
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:36,832
It must be noted that man was bad instincts are more in number than the good

775
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,672
And therefore the best result in governing.

776
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
Terrorization

777
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
And not by academics

778
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Discussions

779
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Sounds

780
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
Like how Alex Jones says the globalist think about us

781
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Yeah I don't like that

782
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
We're stupid

783
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
And the only way that

784
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
Going to want to deal with us is through

785
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
Great

786
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
Because as Alex

787
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
In the past

788
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Where's the Patriots and where

789
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Far outnumbered

790
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
By the asleep

791
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
And we're fart

792
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,440
Destroyed by the global

793
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Gotcha

794
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Here's another one

795
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,352
Next next passage political freedom is an idea but not a fact

796
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:25,472
This idea one must know how to apply whenever it appears necessary with the

797
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,800
Have an idea to attract the masses of the people 21 party

798
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
For the purpose of

799
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
I'm crushing another who's in the Thor

800
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
This task is rendered easier

801
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,528
Opponent has himself been infected with the idea of freedom

802
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
So-called liberalism

803
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,648
And for the sake of an idea is willing to yield some of his power

804
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,184
Is precisely here that the

805
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
The Triumph of our Theory appears

806
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
The slacking brains of government are immediately by the law of life

807
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,120
Caught up and gathered together by a new hand

808
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
Because the blind might of

809
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Of the nation

810
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
Cannot for once

811
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Single-day exist without guidance

812
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,080
Authority merely fits into the place of the old

813
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Already weakened by liberal

814
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
That sounds familiar

815
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Sounds very familiar

816
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,832
I mean I don't know if Alex could use most of those words

817
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
In their proper

818
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
Perhaps not

819
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
But

820
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
The men look at it

821
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
He has his

822
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Conceptus Alex

823
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
They're like it would not be good

824
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,656
Good liberalism is

825
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,984
Tricks in order to get us to socialism which leads to

826
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
Despotism

827
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,640
Your words to today's episode

828
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
Boom that's what that saying

829
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
Is your already infected with

830
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
This idea of liberalism

831
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,648
And because of that you're willing to let go some of your freedoms

832
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
You're not willing to let go of some of the control of the government

833
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
And he's Shady globalist behind the scenes

834
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
Are just going to take over the slack

835
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Whatever's flag

836
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
They're going

837
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
To take it

838
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
Therefore every game is a zero-sum game you lose a little lose an inch to the globalist thing to take to

839
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Yeah

840
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,336
Exactly

841
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
That sucks

842
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Yeah

843
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Good thing or not real

844
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,648
In this next piece

845
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888
Next song

846
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
This

847
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Latest

848
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
This one is

849
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Isn't about my

850
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
A dog

851
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
Will my dog Die album

852
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:46,528
It is indispensable for our purpose that Wars so far as possible should not result in

853
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Territorial

854
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,880
War will just be brought on an economic Brown

855
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
Where the Nations will not fail to perceive

856
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
In the assistance we give

857
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
The strength of our pre

858
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Predominant

859
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
At this state of things

860
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Will put both sides

861
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
At the mercy of our

862
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
International age

863
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Ginger

864
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
Which possesses millions of eyes over it

865
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
Ever on the watch

866
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,592
And unhampered by any limitations whatsoever

867
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,920
Our International rights will then wipe out National Rifle

868
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
In the proper sense of right

869
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Designer

870
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
AR

871
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
Not even really interested in

872
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,536
Like like there is the idea but their main goal is

873
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Is Tubi

874
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,584
Everywhere

875
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
International

876
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
Spreading their money around

877
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
When people become

878
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
Dependent upon.

879
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
MN

880
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,080
Their power over is Over All Nations

881
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Is super

882
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Yeah

883
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Okay

884
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,248
So they they want to go global

885
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,344
What they're saying there to is

886
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
In a Wars

887
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:58,464
Like you can't allow countries to take over other countries

888
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
That's just going to be a mess

889
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,560
Don't want to do that

890
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
Make sure that everything that is strictly Financial which

891
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,936
Alex Jones talks all the time

892
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
Control system

893
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
Of course I will have you playing government

894
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Against each other

895
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
I am in whenever they

896
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
I have wars

897
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
Getting rid of

898
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,992
Which is exactly why

899
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Our International

900
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
Well then why

901
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Yes

902
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Everything will be on a

903
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,000
International Global level as opposed to your own

904
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
National

905
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Concerns

906
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,632
Where is these guys

907
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,192
Just what we said so far till

908
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,752
The bank to get a loan for a small business start-up

909
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
This is such a great plan

910
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,176
But that's the other thing that really needs

911
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
Analysts have gone over this also basically

912
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
It's kind of the same criticism

913
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,648
That I would make swaths of generalities

914
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,792
Truisms and stuff like that

915
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
No specific

916
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
And in the same way

917
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
You go through this entire

918
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
Book

919
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,568
The hesitate to call it a buck

920
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,896
Will you go through it and what you see is a lot of stuff that's like

921
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Okay

922
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Whatever

923
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
I'm exam

924
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
Cuz there was stuff about like the police

925
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
We got a militarize the police

926
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,048
The state will be in much more control the stupid

927
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
That's true

928
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,424
It's it's it's

929
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
It seems like

930
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Axiomatic

931
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
It's just

932
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Yeah

933
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Yeah I got a great

934
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Here is another path

935
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
In the hands of the States today

936
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
There's a great force

937
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
The creates the movement of thought in the people

938
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,015
And that is the press

939
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,343
Department

940
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,135
Is the keep pointing or requirements

941
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
Supposed to be indispensable

942
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,487
To give voice to the complaints of the people

943
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Express

944
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
Enter create biscuit

945
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,703
Presents that are going out of their way to disseminate

946
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,239
False information

947
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Listen to make everybody feel bad

948
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Yes because

949
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Misconception

950
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
The Elders of Zion have taken over

951
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,199
And Alex Jones is conception the globalist

952
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,575
And basically control all of the mainstream media.

953
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,391
Elders took over the Press

954
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,767
Through the Press we have gained the power what are you into

955
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
Thanks for the we've got the gold in our hands

956
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
Notwithstanding

957
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
The Gather it out of the ocean

958
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Tim's of blood in tears

959
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Descriptive setting

960
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Yeah

961
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Whose blood

962
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,895
Yeah yeah

963
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
W

964
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
So

965
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,551
Is absolutely no evidence that it's

966
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Genservice working

967
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
For a

968
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,719
Because what else would a government especially an autocratic government

969
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,279
Other than the demonization of

970
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
The Free Press

971
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
They want control over the dissemination of information

972
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
It's a good thing never happened

973
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
But more to the point

974
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,199
I hope at this point you're starting to see

975
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,735
Many many shades

976
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,575
The Fairly important pieces of Alex Jones's World philosophy

977
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,623
Globalist

978
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:42,207
But he's super afraid of

979
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
Congress we have right now

980
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,119
Well I think is kind of an issue

981
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
Because

982
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,495
Spell because Alex Jones is very much

983
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
Not upfront about Allah

984
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,871
The things that underlie his belief in the globalist

985
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
He has given somewhat of a path

986
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,503
And whatever you can he gets accused of being auntie

987
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:11,903
Somatic or anything like that he gets the fallback be like

988
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,207
Right and because he has that sort of cushion butt

989
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,231
Truth

990
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,071
It's easy for other people who are conservatives minded

991
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
To be tricked

992
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,399
And not realize that what underlies

993
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
His beliefs is

994
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Mastiff

995
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,287
The same thing is like

996
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
It doesn't matter if you know everybody bleeds red blood

997
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
Black people are far scarier that's why the cops killed

998
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:40,575
We have people who are very much in the same ilk

999
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
What's Jones

1000
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Tempt Providence

1001
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
Media

1002
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
You have Alex Jones you have Drudge

1003
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
WorldNetDaily

1004
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
You have all these sites

1005
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
The put out

1006
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Similar

1007
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Sort of contact

1008
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
And reinforce each other

1009
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
And backup the globalist narrative

1010
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,799
You end up having a conservative world

1011
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:05,151
That is largely accidentally or intentionally I'm not entirely sure

1012
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
Based on a lot of it

1013
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Yeah

1014
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,991
And I don't know if ever I don't

1015
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,831
It's not that I don't think anyone knows because a lot of people do

1016
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:19,487
But I don't know if the people who are under the sway of this stuff and believe

1017
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,791
Give this stuff really recognized

1018
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
And

1019
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
To me that's kind of scary

1020
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Because

1021
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Now you have

1022
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
People who

1023
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,311
Motivated by things that are ages medican origin

1024
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,383
Being able to fight for the same goal

1025
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Without

1026
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Admitting that

1027
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Well what

1028
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Afraid of is

1029
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
These Jew Banker

1030
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
Well I don't think it's that I think

1031
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
I think from what I've heard so far

1032
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,367
What word

1033
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Dealing with is just

1034
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,231
Not anti-Semitic

1035
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
But

1036
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
What

1037
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,351
So it's it's almost the reverse

1038
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,447
Instead of instead of a

1039
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Nation

1040
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,495
Intelligence service

1041
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Disseminating information

1042
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
Turn on this route

1043
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,335
Small group of people

1044
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
In order to

1045
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
I am assuming

1046
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
Something along those

1047
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Instead it's reverse

1048
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
So now a small group of white people are using

1049
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
Things to demonize

1050
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,695
Everybody that's not white

1051
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,815
I mean

1052
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
Jus for globalist

1053
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
Because you're not going after

1054
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,703
Jews you're going after Jews

1055
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Ann Black

1056
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
People are Muslim

1057
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
You're going after everybody

1058
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
That's fair

1059
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Go back to the

1060
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,967
So

1061
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
This next part is about

1062
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
How

1063
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
They

1064
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
When

1065
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
The goal was to create such strife

1066
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,095
And such a negative position that would they will reveal themselves of the savior

1067
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
And will beg for their help

1068
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
We have to we have to

1069
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,287
Reactions

1070
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,079
Terrible

1071
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
Living situation

1072
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
That's totally awful

1073
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Give off

1074
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,247
The solution

1075
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
I am retaking

1076
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
We B

1077
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Nigerian dialect

1078
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
Nowadays with the destruction of the aristocracy

1079
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,023
Merciless money grinding

1080
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
Scoundrels

1081
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Crew Yoakam

1082
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
Upon the necks of the worker

1083
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,655
We appear on the

1084
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
The scene is alleged to saviors of the worker

1085
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
From this oppression

1086
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,007
When we proposed

1087
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
To enter the ring

1088
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,055
Of our fighting force

1089
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Socialist

1090
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Anarchist communist

1091
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Do we always give support

1092
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Accordance with the alleged

1093
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
Brotherly rule

1094
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
Of the solidarity of all Humanity

1095
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,783
Of our social Mesa

1096
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
There is docracy which enjoyed the

1097
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,487
Was interested in seeing that the workers were well-fed hungry and strong

1098
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
We are interested in just the opposite

1099
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Hemet

1100
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
The Killing out of the goyim

1101
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Our power is in

1102
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,959
The Chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker

1103
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
Because by all this

1104
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,567
They all that this implies he is made

1105
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Slave of our well

1106
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:16,895
In his own

1107
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Authorities

1108
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
YouTube

1109
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Strength or energy

1110
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
Decide against our will

1111
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,343
Hunger creates the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given the

1112
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,903
Art by the aristocracy by the legal authority of King

1113
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
So in there

1114
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Saying that

1115
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
Because there are no Kings anymore

1116
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
And there's all this capitalism

1117
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
People are being the other workers are being

1118
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
And the other being a

1119
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Essentially

1120
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
And we will show ourselves

1121
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,311
To be the solution to that problem

1122
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Further in

1123
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,151
Mutating with socialist

1124
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Some communist

1125
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,223
But that will all be just a

1126
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
12 lb

1127
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
Goyim

1128
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,207
Alex Jones killing off

1129
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,999
All the people who aren't

1130
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
Why would you say this in a meeting

1131
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Why would you write this

1132
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
That's the other problem

1133
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:19,103
Don't record it a little meeting room

1134
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,503
It's it's not like everybody had iPhones back then it was for the recorded this

1135
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,647
It's patently absurd

1136
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,207
But in very very big

1137
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,231
Pieces of Alex Jones

1138
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
He's about the globalist

1139
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
And that they are going

1140
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
To introduce socialism

1141
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
As a way to

1142
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,191
Neutrik downtrodden people

1143
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,519
They're going to trick them

1144
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,591
Into this control globalist want

1145
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
To kill you and your family

1146
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
He says it all the time

1147
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:57,503
We will go check them

1148
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,783
Kill off all of them

1149
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,831
The other big piece of his thingy

1150
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
You always talked about how the globalist

1151
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
Want to make you weak because of your week

1152
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
You can't fight back again

1153
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
Conception

1154
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
Because I guess your other one tons of vaccines and s*** back in 1980e not the prevalence of we have

1155
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
The specifics

1156
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,615
Of vaccines and putting stuff in the food but that is why I was Jones is willing

1157
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,919
To believe those narrative even though

1158
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
The facts don't back them up

1159
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Because

1160
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
It reinforces

1161
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Does this sort of an idea

1162
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
The comes from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1163
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,903
This idea that the globalist

1164
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Want to keep us weak

1165
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
In order to not be able

1166
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
The fightback

1167
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Insulate soft Killa

1168
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
With vaccines

1169
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
I'm stuck in the water

1170
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
By trying to kill masculinity

1171
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,167
All

1172
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,263
Exam ways remix

1173
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Alright

1174
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
Writing back then

1175
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,383
I would throw and give everybody

1176
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Sure

1177
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,455
Themes

1178
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,527
This is it this is a terrible master plan

1179
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,831
Totally this is a

1180
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
What do we spell talk

1181
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
We already

1182
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
True

1183
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:17,631
We could have too much backlash

1184
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,215
Because they can't control the smallpox once it gets going

1185
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:26,847
Here's a very essential

1186
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,687
Elvis Master plant that is that when it goes down

1187
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
People who master

1188
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
And it will be safe

1189
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
There we go

1190
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,623
The hatred this hatred will be further magnified by the effects

1191
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,903
Seven economic crisis

1192
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,719
Which will stop dealing on the exchange

1193
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
And bring industry to a standstill

1194
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,607
We shall create by all the secrets Subterranean methods open today

1195
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
With the aid of gold

1196
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,167
Which is all that are hand

1197
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
A universal economic crisis

1198
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,359
Who mobs of workers simultaneously in all the countries of Europe

1199
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,943
These mobs were rushed to shed the blood of those

1200
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
Henderson plicity of their ignorance

1201
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,527
From their cradles

1202
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,087
And whose property they will then be able to loot

1203
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
They will not touch

1204
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,695
Because the moment of attack will be known to us

1205
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
We will take measures

1206
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
To protect our own

1207
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,327
Alright now we have a new guest

1208
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:24,191
He's going to talk to us about the coming Financial collapse told you about

1209
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,591
It's coming in late September and we got him coming on he's going to

1210
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Weigel

1211
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:38,271
$8,000

1212
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:44,671
Orchestrated the global economic collapse and then

1213
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
At the end

1214
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,767
Talking about how these are going to be safe

1215
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,327
Because they know when it's going to happen cuz they're doing it right

1216
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,399
All the time by the globalist they're fleeing

1217
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
Heading to armored without all the f****** time cuz they know when the attack is going to happen

1218
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
Did it

1219
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,103
Right now

1220
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Let me ask you a

1221
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
I love question

1222
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,343
Do they ever stop to sell any kind of boner

1223
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:20,511
Okay now we know it's going to happen we know how it's going to go down but listen

1224
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,095
We have an Easter to work

1225
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:29,471
Play kids music

1226
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,367
I'm not nearly done

1227
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,231
Ever since that time we've been leaving the people's from one disenchantment to another

1228
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,375
So that in the end they should turn also from us in favor of the Zion

1229
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,167
We're preparing for the world

1230
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
That's basically games

1231
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
We're making people miserable

1232
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,079
In order that eventually they'll fall right into our trap

1233
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
Haha

1234
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,919
The art of directing math

1235
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,759
Individual Spherion verbage

1236
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,551
Fire regulations

1237
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,599
Then comment and all sorts of other quirks

1238
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
It all which the goyim understand nothing

1239
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
The Specialist of Art

1240
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Creative brain

1241
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:28,095
Reared on analysis observation indicates of fine calculation

1242
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,655
In this species of scale we have no rival

1243
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
Any more than we have

1244
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
In the drawing up of

1245
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
Collection

1246
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
In solidarity

1247
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Villains like important

1248
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
It drives

1249
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
A drive-thru

1250
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
Because that Passage

1251
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,015
Could have written

1252
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
Could have been

1253
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
About the people

1254
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
Who are Distributing this thing

1255
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,951
Right that's exactly what they're saying

1256
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
That's exactly what

1257
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,815
Look up might as well have been that intelligence offer being like

1258
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,375
Check this s*** I'm just going to tell him what we're doing to him

1259
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,847
It it is it is pretty wild when you step back to realize

1260
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
Just how much of this is

1261
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
Completely ripped off

1262
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
An entire fraud

1263
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
You start to think about realized

1264
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
The

1265
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
Reasons for the fraud

1266
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
It does become very bizarre

1267
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Yeah just

1268
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,839
You're saying that these people are using propaganda but you're doing that with in

1269
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
A propaganda attack

1270
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,191
Yeah it's just very amazing

1271
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
It's it's layers upon layers

1272
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
Perhaps

1273
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
Let's take it one

1274
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,383
Let's let's Inception

1275
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,175
We're going to go one more level.

1276
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
Maybe

1277
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,527
This

1278
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,111
Actually is propaganda by the Elders of Zion

1279
00:55:54,623 --> 00:56:00,255
The intelligence community

1280
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:06,655
Make about the Elders of Zion

1281
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:12,799
Still about make no mistake

1282
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,639
This argument is made on Stormfront Mega so

1283
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,783
Here's another passage the intensification of armaments

1284
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,063
Armored redoubt

1285
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,391
Decrease of police forces are all essential

1286
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
For the completion of our Afroman

1287
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
Engine plans

1288
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
We have to get

1289
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,047
Is there should be in all the states

1290
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Overworld

1291
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,143
Besides ourselves only the masses of the proletariat

1292
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,959
A few millionaires devoted to our interest police

1293
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
And soldiers

1294
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,519
George Soros

1295
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Soldiers

1296
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
Do they have

1297
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,639
A few millionaires

1298
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,479
Millionaires is George Soros

1299
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:58,879
Don't get slam Jack

1300
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,463
Giving a speech to the other Elders of Zion right might as well

1301
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
Age regression technology is right now

1302
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:08,607
You got some nerve

1303
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,983
So Alex Jones is super afraid of

1304
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,055
The idea that the globalists are going to bring out a police state

1305
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
I am

1306
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
Commence right here it's and their goals

1307
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,687
Create

1308
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
Police then a few millionaire

1309
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
Forget to live freely

1310
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,463
Throughout all of Europe

1311
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,743
Call Europe

1312
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
And by means of relations with Europe

1313
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Another time

1314
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,583
Also we must

1315
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,607
Creates ferment

1316
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
Discord

1317
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Hostility

1318
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Just they're going to

1319
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
All around the world

1320
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,335
This is the else invented

1321
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,175
Alex Jones has a lot of ideas about education

1322
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Here's bathroom

1323
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,439
We've fooled bemused and corrupted the Youth of the goyim by rearing them and principles and theories which are known to us

1324
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
Ruby Falls

1325
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Although

1326
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
It is

1327
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
It is ended

1328
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
Globalist

1329
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Two things that are complete lies

1330
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
They

1331
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,799
You know trick you into believing you're growing up

1332
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,591
Climate change

1333
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
Gay rights

1334
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
Yeah these tortillas

1335
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
Is that

1336
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
So it's all good

1337
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
It's all these things that they know

1338
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
2B bulshit

1339
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
They're sucking with

1340
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
Your head by getting you to

1341
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
Brett

1342
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
Which

1343
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
That's very Alex

1344
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
This is all f******

1345
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
I just

1346
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
I just don't like

1347
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,799
I feel like I'm being attacked by two people

1348
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,127
Attack by Alex Jones

1349
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,919
Believing this basic

1350
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,479
And now you read English it to me

1351
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:05,343
Fighting in my brain right now I think I hate this

1352
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,415
But I think it's important

1353
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,439
To look at it

1354
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,487
Because it is a very important piece

1355
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
Of his world

1356
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:18,911
And without it we can have a fully robust picture what it is that's behind Alex Jones

1357
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
What

1358
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,983
Bulshit

1359
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Yeah

1360
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
Answer when you when you have these

1361
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
These things

1362
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,639
From the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1363
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,223
It's not necessarily preachings ammo clock

1364
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
But they are

1365
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,063
Entirely in line with

1366
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
His beliefs about the global

1367
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,183
And when you look at the stories that he believed

1368
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
And the things that he

1369
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,815
The things that are parts of his bulshit narrative

1370
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
But don't stand up

1371
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
To the scrutiny of fat

1372
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,679
A lot of it can be traced back

1373
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Back to this

1374
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
Because like you said with the Purple Penguin stuff

1375
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
If you look at the facts of that

1376
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,103
Benignly

1377
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
It's nothing it's not something that even if

1378
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,479
Conservative person necessarily should be screaming about baby make

1379
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
King fun of

1380
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,295
I could see Rush making fun of it

1381
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Or something like that

1382
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
But the idea that you be actually angry about it and thinking

1383
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
It means something

1384
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
You have to believe

1385
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,583
The globalists are doing it specifically to f*** with people's minds

1386
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
And that has its roots

1387
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
Right here

1388
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,959
You don't think

1389
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,007
It could have been

1390
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Okay

1391
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
Maintenance

1392
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,223
I don't know if it's like

1393
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
If two comics

1394
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,623
Come up with the same promise her little finger

1395
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,183
Cuz this sounds really damning

1396
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,999
I don't think it's parallel thinking

1397
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Because there's

1398
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Too much overlap

1399
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Yeah

1400
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
You know I don't want to call Alex

1401
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,543
Cuz that's

1402
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:05,663
Second timer

1403
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:12,063
He does try comedy quite a bit but I have to stand up comedy

1404
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,599
So two guys go back in the archives

1405
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
I am not willing to believe parallel thinking

1406
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Believe

1407
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,559
Like parallel sourcing

1408
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,095
Like I said with books

1409
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
Into

1410
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,447
The narratives that he believes those are also heavily based

1411
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
On 1st

1412
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,799
Like like how even if you haven't

1413
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,079
19 Casablanca

1414
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,639
You know the bait in like it's so

1415
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
Part of our culture

1416
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Community

1417
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
Zeitgeist

1418
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,551
But you still kind of know what happened

1419
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,439
If you live in Chicago and you seen a bunch of Chicago

1420
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,279
Using Kaioken

1421
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
You know I'm saying

1422
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
Yep

1423
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,959
People's influence shows through

1424
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,983
Their product

1425
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,543
Yeah people who are deeply inspired by

1426
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Sure

1427
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
You have a lot of the protocols

1428
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,295
And those are a lot of

1429
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:22,207
Appreciate you trying to bring funding to this this structure is difficult without clip

1430
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
But videos

1431
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071
They're talking about how they want to take over the world

1432
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
To secure their

1433
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:34,239
We must have everybody vote without distinction of classes and qualification

1434
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,567
In order to establish an absolute majority

1435
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,615
Which can be got from the educator

1436
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,151
Property

1437
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
In this way by implicating in a

1438
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,271
Of self-importance

1439
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
We shelter

1440
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
Destroy among the goyim the important

1441
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
To the family

1442
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
Educational value

1443
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,975
Alex always talks about how the globalist want to destroy your family

1444
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:00,351
They want to get rid of it everybody should be raised

1445
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,311
St. Mary's in order to make a democracy

1446
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,591
Goodnight everybody

1447
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,663
No is voting equally everybody

1448
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,967
Isaac

1449
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,271
Inw destroy

1450
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,807
Peoples

1451
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
And you can do this in a democracy

1452
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
As most people

1453
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Most people are just go

1454
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,535
In that majority-minority

1455
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
Yep

1456
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Oh boy

1457
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:41,055
When we introduced

1458
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
True

1459
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,919
Hitler is the Hitler is also an elder

1460
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
They were set up

1461
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
Hitler had some good ideas

1462
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
So

1463
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,047
When we introduced into the state organisms

1464
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,863
It's whole political complexion underwent a change

1465
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,423
States of infused with a mortal illness

1466
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Blood

1467
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,471
All That Remains

1468
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
Has to wait the end

1469
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,799
Liberalism produced

1470
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,079
Constitutional state

1471
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:17,663
Which took the place of what was the only Safeguard of the goyim

1472
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,943
Namely despot

1473
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
So

1474
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
This has

1475
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
How is it

1476
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
How is it that

1477
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,391
These people

1478
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,439
The only place

1479
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,719
This kind of chicken

1480
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
Come from

1481
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
Is

1482
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,303
An authoritarian

1483
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
Dictatorship

1484
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,423
Like the only people who would absolutely

1485
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,959
Advocate for

1486
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,983
Despotism

1487
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,823
Nobody

1488
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
Contained within the

1489
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:50,175
Pretense of the fact that they

1490
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
Sakrete

1491
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
A global

1492
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
They wanted to have it

1493
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,807
Despotic rule over the entire world

1494
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,599
Yeah but that doesn't make any sense

1495
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,975
Consolidate the already despotism that you have

1496
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,023
Especially if we're talking about

1497
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,327
Oppression

1498
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
Or

1499
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Situation

1500
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
Those people aren't

1501
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
The people who would

1502
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,567
Give this information out who would fight against liberalism

1503
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,127
Are the people already in power

1504
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,223
True why would you think that people out of power

1505
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,527
Would plot this liberalism

1506
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
In order to

1507
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Their own desperate

1508
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,023
Cuz that's what they're essentially doing they're saying that we're not the Dust

1509
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,607
No but they're also sort of making the argument the despotism is

1510
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
In the past

1511
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
And that was the only thing that was keeping

1512
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
The goyim the Sheep

1513
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Safe

1514
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:51,615
Couldn't take them out

1515
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,663
Liberalism

1516
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Can come in

1517
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
Come over the top

1518
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
So they couldn't do that for

1519
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Right

1520
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
So there

1521
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
So they're okay

1522
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:07,743
It's almost making the argument that a dictatorship is the only way

1523
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
Alex Jones is interested

1524
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
Yeah yeah

1525
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
The only way or well I mean

1526
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,959
With bannon's interested tearing everything.

1527
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,519
Right and only then can something be rebuilt

1528
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
Like

1529
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Right there

1530
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Tyranny

1531
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
So

1532
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,551
Do you know how that you know how tyranny will always always

1533
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
Gives up

1534
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:35,903
Like tyranny is well-known for only being some

1535
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
He never goes

1536
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
To fart in absolutes

1537
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,607
I'm cool with some tyranny is like

1538
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
That's just how that work

1539
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,191
So you might be thinking how much

1540
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,031
Control do these here zionists have over the political process

1541
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
God dammit if it's

1542
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
It's not 100

1543
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,199
In the near future we shall establish the responsibility of president

1544
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:05,855
We shall arrange elections in favor of such presidents as having their pasts

1545
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
Discovered

1546
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:13,023
Some Panama City Panama weather

1547
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,327
Where the agent

1548
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,399
It's for the accomplishment of our plans out of the fear of Revelation

1549
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,727
Hey I'm from the natural desire of everyone who is attained power

1550
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:26,079
Namely the retention of privileges advantage and connected with the office

1551
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
The president

1552
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,943
Legitimately

1553
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:37,343
Globalism is kept in place by pedophile pedophile blackmail

1554
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,647
Blackmail sure there's other stuff drug-running one have you

1555
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,463
But yeah a lot of child murder files

1556
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,023
That's the narrative

1557
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Like Benghazi

1558
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
The globalist

1559
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
This again change the name

1560
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
Digby globalist

1561
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:56,543
Arrange a favor of such president undiscovered stain

1562
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
So stupid

1563
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,663
So stupid all it takes so much of it is here

1564
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
So much of it is in the stupid book

1565
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
Right I've always

1566
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,111
How is it that year old

1567
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,135
Pamphlet

1568
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
Because there was a thousand years of

1569
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
Before that

1570
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,863
Already is a coiled spring already

1571
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,167
This is just like

1572
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,775
You want to hate them and now we've been given fraudulent proof that you should

1573
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,335
That's essentially what's going on

1574
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
Endive

1575
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
And that's why it is lingard

1576
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:40,063
For a hundred something

1577
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,159
Really makes it mainstream people who were talking about like

1578
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,951
The ideas of the globalist

1579
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
If when you look at the history of it

1580
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Back in the light

1581
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
I don't know if you go back to

1582
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
Like a 50s

1583
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
M60sbs

1584
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Abyss sword

1585
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
We're about Jew Banker

1586
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
Yeah and stuff like that

1587
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
It wasn't it

1588
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,687
Is couched in euphemism about

1589
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,527
One has the 50s as

1590
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,951
So

1591
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
Is another path

1592
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,607
By such measure we shall obtain the power of destroying little by little step by step

1593
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,423
All the doubts that when we enter our right

1594
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,495
We are compelled to introduce into the Constitution

1595
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
The state to prepare for the transition to an imp

1596
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,127
Perceptible abolition of every kind of cons

1597
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Institution

1598
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
And then the time

1599
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Iscom

1600
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,479
To turn every form of government

1601
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
You are deaf

1602
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,807
Their game is Just reinforcing

1603
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,599
The idea that

1604
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,671
You know it is heading to a one-world despotic governor

1605
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,463
You're shaking your head

1606
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,023
I just I'm just thinking the baffling

1607
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,583
Like

1608
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
Like

1609
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,399
How is how do you read this

1610
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
And not sink

1611
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,727
Do the best plan is to just

1612
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
Let these guys

1613
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
Pretend

1614
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
And have fun

1615
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
What do you mean

1616
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:11,967
I know but that's what I'm saying even if these people are real and you're reading Pez

1617
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,527
My thought is like

1618
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,575
That's such a

1619
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,111
Terrible plant

1620
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Triad

1621
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,255
It's going to fail just on its own

1622
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,399
If you have a cold

1623
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
It's never going to work

1624
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,751
They've all the gold they've infiltrated the media they've

1625
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:39,615
Eroded the very idea of education so all of the people are dumb

1626
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,663
You have a dumb down population

1627
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
That shackle

1628
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,015
Intentionally by the bonds of workaday slavery

1629
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
But that's just Scientology

1630
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
Somewhat

1631
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
For sure

1632
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:06,751
I mean the ideas of the globalist in a lot of this stuff is essentially what it does

1633
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Callmesnat

1634
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:14,175
Neren

1635
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
Bible

1636
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,063
To him it's a cult

1637
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,367
Like it's not real world

1638
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
Very very dangerous

1639
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,183
Do you think

1640
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Episode

1641
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,303
So this kind of makes me feel like the way that we should

1642
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,071
Be

1643
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,607
Handling this bulge

1644
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
The way that we

1645
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
Be handling all of this b*******

1646
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Is the same way that we had

1647
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
Handle

1648
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
Is the same

1649
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,615
Like so if I hope on some level

1650
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,967
Ambivalent Alex Jones listeners might be able to come and find our show

1651
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Oh

1652
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Alright

1653
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
I hope

1654
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:56,415
Yeah I don't think that's necessarily ever going to be the case I think we should just start by finding regular

1655
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:03,071
Thank you for listening what I'm saying is like I think that the only way

1656
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,863
I really did do battle with Colt

1657
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
Is deprogramming

1658
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:11,519
By making fun of the ideas of the cult

1659
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
You can

1660
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
Research

1661
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
And bring to light why the cult is full of s***

1662
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,687
Or you can just hope for people

1663
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Like

1664
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,503
Like URI Escape

1665
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,831
Really what it was

1666
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,879
I have

1667
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,975
Illiterate I escaped weird Christianity but it was

1668
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,911
Fall in with the Colts

1669
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
So I mean

1670
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
I don't want you to

1671
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
I don't want to be

1672
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,895
Look up the No Name Fellowship

1673
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,503
You can find them online say if they were on a watch list

1674
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
Because of what they believed in a kid.

1675
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:02,207
But you you didn't have some like a podcast about how stupid

1676
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,815
Did not

1677
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,887
Well that's what we offer for

1678
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
Little boy that's what we have to offer to the end

1679
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,847
More liberal

1680
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,383
Break right there

1681
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,175
This is not a liberal bashing

1682
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,479
The part played by the Liberals

1683
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Utopian dreamers

1684
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,319
Will be finally played out when our government is

1685
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Is acknowledged

1686
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,159
Till such time they will continue to do us good service

1687
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,999
Therefore we shall continue to direct their minds to all sorts of

1688
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,791
Conceptions of fantastic Theory

1689
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
New and apparently Progressive

1690
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,215
Have not have we not with complete success turn the brain with heads of the Glam with progress

1691
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,799
Till There is not among the going one mind able to

1692
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,591
Received it under this word

1693
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
Why the departure from

1694
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Truth in all cases

1695
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,223
Where it is not a question of material inventions

1696
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
Fallacious idea

1697
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,039
Serves to obscure truth

1698
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,343
So that none may know it except us

1699
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
The chosen of God

1700
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
It's gardening

1701
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Guardians

1702
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
That's magical technology

1703
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:13,119
Well that's Med beds right there possibly but also the idea contained

1704
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:18,239
Conceptions and fantastic theories new and apparently Progressive

1705
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,799
That's just Alex Jones talking about

1706
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,871
You know you're trying to confuse you with trans stuff

1707
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,711
Yeah I'd like that they're just trying to change the language

1708
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Weird stop

1709
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,599
It's right here that's what liberal progressiveness is

1710
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,159
It's just a plot on the part of the globalist

1711
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,231
Which book you want to read

1712
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,535
People just really hate people's life

1713
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,911
That's what you read people get really angry

1714
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
Whatever like

1715
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:51,519
Like Alex Jones is idea of prosperity is

1716
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Forever

1717
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,895
Booze is bad for everyone

1718
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:02,015
We don't have a healthcare Protocols of the Elders of Zion

1719
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,831
Someone forever

1720
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
Black Reborns

1721
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
The same thing

1722
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
It wouldn't have

1723
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
F****** people

1724
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,023
And I'm not I don't know how that

1725
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
Fine

1726
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,703
You wouldn't have you have an inch

1727
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
Insurance Company

1728
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
Right

1729
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,359
Stop was specially when you distrust

1730
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,407
Like the idea of distrusting

1731
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Progress

1732
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Is a real dangerous

1733
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,015
In your world

1734
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
Because what's the

1735
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,831
Alternative

1736
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Regress

1737
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Conservative

1738
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Right

1739
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,303
The only two things you really can do is move or stay the same as a civilization

1740
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,839
If you can't say the same

1741
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:52,191
No it's like you're always going

1742
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,239
To err on the side of backwards

1743
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,055
Yeah we're moving backwards as opposed to move

1744
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:02,943
Forward calls from the military is not

1745
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
It's not a good idea

1746
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,503
It's very dumb

1747
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:09,343
And probably illegal probably

1748
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
All the stuff is

1749
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,207
Regressive it's backwards-facing

1750
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
And

1751
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,791
And if you're going to talk about

1752
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
It like

1753
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,399
Everybody

1754
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
Progressive

1755
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:27,519
Everybody

1756
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,567
Never stopped

1757
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,127
To think okay so if we're going back

1758
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,015
From the actual going back or back then

1759
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Progressive

1760
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
No no

1761
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,463
The forward motion Through Time

1762
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,863
If we if we like I know the answer is going to be

1763
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Write 8

1764
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
To mention

1765
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
It's f****** rich

1766
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,591
Oliver rich white Christmas

1767
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:06,175
It's all of those people who are the ones who always want

1768
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
Back

1769
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,295
They realize they are not important

1770
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
And they're not in power

1771
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
And that's why this is really effective

1772
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
So

1773
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,815
Really interests

1774
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
Until recent times

1775
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,447
Autocracy

1776
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,775
The one and only serious though we had in the world

1777
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
Why does Alex Jones always say

1778
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
That the Russians

1779
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
Are one of the only people who

1780
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,759
Kicked out the oligarchs

1781
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,295
Who kicked out the globalist

1782
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
It's in here

1783
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
It's in here

1784
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
The only threat

1785
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,743
The design has felt they had

1786
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Was it

1787
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Pretty

1788
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,519
Referring to like the anti-Semitism of the czar's and s*** like that

1789
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,543
But

1790
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
It's still track

1791
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,871
Terms of mentality that the Russians

1792
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
The strong one

1793
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,431
Anime resisted

1794
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
Is globalist

1795
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,991
Why is Zionist

1796
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
The mask

1797
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Man

1798
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
I thought you were going to say

1799
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
I'm just f******

1800
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:33,215
This week

1801
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:37,567
Give me an all hope that's not my goal my goal

1802
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,847
Like what has

1803
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Change

1804
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
Nothing

1805
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
What exchange from this f****** Tech

1806
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,247
Close dealing with this

1807
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,551
They're still

1808
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,111
Close I've gotten a lot better presentation

1809
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
Unacceptable for Alex Jones

1810
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
2

1811
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Reveal

1812
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
But so much of this is based on protocol

1813
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,911
The fact that we have a society where

1814
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,447
You have to hide a bigotry

1815
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
As opposed to

1816
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:15,967
I still think about a year to you all have to be grass-fed

1817
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
In terms of

1818
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
You know like

1819
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,695
Tattoos

1820
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
I don't seem to hurt them

1821
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
Delco great

1822
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351
Right

1823
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,655
Nazi tattoo

1824
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:39,775
Stripper lady who married Jeff swastika tattooed on her body

1825
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,103
Sammy like she became a celebrity for a little while and all that did was

1826
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,407
Edible markers you made a lot of money

1827
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,991
I don't know I read where the world is going on

1828
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Be asleep

1829
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
You shouldn't lose hope

1830
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
There's Hope in

1831
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
And lots of drugs

1832
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,719
I don't think anybody's ever said

1833
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
Open

1834
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,887
Thursday self-satisfied

1835
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:11,519
And once it all goes down we will die but it's some point

1836
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,104
I Told You So told you so just like

1837
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
Alright

1838
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,968
We said what we needed to say

1839
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:24,832
In order to affect the destruction of all Collective forces except ours

1840
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,368
We shall emasculate the

1841
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:31,488
The first stage of collectivism now this is about education

1842
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,328
Emasculate the first stage of collectivism the University

1843
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
By re-educating them in a New Direction

1844
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,520
Their officials and professors will be prepared for their business by detailed secret programs of action

1845
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:46,848
From which they will not with one immunity deferred

1846
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,128
Not by one iota

1847
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:50,688
They will be appointed with special precaution

1848
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
And will be so place

1849
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,016
Wholly dependent on the government

1850
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Alex Jones believe

1851
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,160
The colleges are campuses.

1852
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
And I professors

1853
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,232
Through the foundation

1854
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
Are just

1855
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,584
Being given marching orders and they spout globalist propaganda

1856
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
He did not go to college

1857
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,144
Doted

1858
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
I went to college

1859
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,752
And my dad is going to Professor my entire life

1860
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,800
I've known many professors

1861
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,592
I can say

1862
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,176
At least as far as the religious studies Departments of multiple

1863
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
Major United States University

1864
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,504
They're not getting marching orders from

1865
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,832
Except

1866
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,512
I don't think I've ever even had two professors

1867
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,560
Using the same book agree on what

1868
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,584
The book says yeah

1869
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:45,472
Yeah that's the robustness of university life

1870
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
Is

1871
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,312
It's the same thing that Alex Jones

1872
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
Facts about

1873
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
It's a college

1874
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
Because of the diversity of thought

1875
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,456
And that diversity of thought

1876
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,528
Whenever they bring it back makes you think they've been brainwashed

1877
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
When it's really just

1878
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,624
Oh I've been exposed to real thing

1879
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,464
Right but the diversity of thought leads you to a more liberal more

1880
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,792
Progressive Finance that generally

1881
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
Feels like you're being brain

1882
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,728
You've been personally it appears that

1883
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:22,080
You shed your small-town bigotry

1884
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,616
But

1885
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
It's

1886
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,664
It's right out of here

1887
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,456
Book

1888
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,296
So Alex Jones talks about how The globalist Wanted

1889
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,576
Destroy our memories

1890
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
And he's special because he has a memory

1891
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,416
And beyond that

1892
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,792
The only thing he was ever taught growing up

1893
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,072
That's how bad the West is

1894
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
I wasn't

1895
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:49,472
We shall erased from the memory of men all facts of previous centuries

1896
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,264
Which are undesirable to us

1897
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,104
And leave only those which depicts all the errors of the government of

1898
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
The goyim

1899
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Wow

1900
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,480
That's dad on man that's exactly what that

1901
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
Dad on and I don't believe that in the real world Alex Jones was literally taught only that suck in the West

1902
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,720
Does Babs I don't believe that for a second

1903
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,560
Specially not f****** Dallas in the 16th

1904
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
32 that America is the greatest

1905
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,960
No I imagine the worst subversive voices throughout the

1906
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,984
60s and 70s

1907
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,544
Are you seeing some America bashing going on

1908
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,360
In the counterculture in the last certainly that was

1909
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
Pervasive

1910
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,176
But that's not

1911
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
That's not what

1912
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
He claims

1913
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,552
He claimed that all he was taught growing up as how bad the West is

1914
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,088
I believe that

1915
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,368
I believe it's

1916
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
Perception of you

1917
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
Inflicted upon himself

1918
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,488
Either directly from the protocols

1919
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
Or from other sources

1920
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Pez dispensers to put him second

1921
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
Yeah

1922
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
So

1923
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:56,032
I think we only have a couple more of these last year from the

1924
01:23:56,288 --> 01:24:00,896
And if you didn't want to just sit here and read at you for like 3 hours

1925
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Examples

1926
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
So it started out as a pamphlet how long is it now

1927
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:14,976
There's 24 protocols

1928
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
This speaker gets off base

1929
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,632
A little bit there are some derivate on Mars

1930
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,984
What I would call Flights of Fancy

1931
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:30,080
Okay I don't know I would I would say maybe

1932
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:36,480
It's hard to tell cuz I have a Kindle and it doesn't keep track of page numbers necessarily be like

1933
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,552
70 to 100 pages

1934
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,440
Like it started out as this little pamphlet

1935
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:49,280
82 and Addison Woods back then could be big didn't have TV

1936
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
Just a street book

1937
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,008
It's on my loose paper

1938
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
Anti-semite

1939
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,200
Where's the next one little bit

1940
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:14,368
The legal fiction that everything in his fate belongs to him

1941
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,672
Which easily be translated into fat

1942
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:21,536
Will be enabled to resort to the lawful confiscation of all songs of every kind

1943
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,096
For the regulation of their circulation in the state

1944
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,632
From this follows the

1945
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,656
Backpacks

1946
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,192
Will that be covered by a

1947
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
Progressive tax on property

1948
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,896
That's all about guns

1949
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,944
Regulated

1950
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
Controlling

1951
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,272
That guns all the way

1952
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,600
Know if we can't get bitched out

1953
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,648
Well I guess you can

1954
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:52,768
About how much he doesn't believe in progressive tax

1955
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,584
Federal

1956
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
There should be a flat tax

1957
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,168
You should tithe

1958
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:05,568
Healthcare we should go back

1959
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
Did all of it

1960
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,456
Barbers did all that

1961
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:17,856
I mean I think I was hoping I was hoping that if I got another broken arm they would just take it

1962
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:21,184
What book did the regulation stuff you talk about does exist

1963
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,720
In pieces that I didn't pull out

1964
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:28,352
Disarm population as opposed to lead them to war

1965
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:32,448
Right sort of thing like those sorts of fields at within it

1966
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:35,008
But there isn't as much talk about guns

1967
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:35,776
Necessarily

1968
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Cuz of 90

1969
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:44,224
Technology was talking about it wasn't

1970
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,040
I believe that this passage is more like actually just

1971
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,880
Does mirror

1972
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
To some extent Alex Jones

1973
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
Isabel

1974
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
Fisher

1975
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,536
Economic crises have been produced by us

1976
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,840
For the goyim by no other memes

1977
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,912
I believe that there's a mist

1978
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
For no other memes

1979
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,032
Then the withdrawal of money from circulation

1980
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,592
Let me try that again

1981
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,152
Economic crises have been produced

1982
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:18,272
Bios for the goyim for no other means than withdrawal of money from circulation

1983
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
Cute capitals

1984
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,344
Stagnated withdrawing money for

1985
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,416
State which were constantly

1986
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,440
Apply for those

1987
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,976
Same state capitals for

1988
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
So

1989
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,560
They create economic crises

1990
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,608
So they can take money out of the systems

1991
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888
Take it for themselves

1992
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
Process that gives

1993
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
Massive loan

1994
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:40,032
Two countries when they make them fight with each other

1995
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,056
In order to

1996
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:44,384
Put them in situations where they can't possibly

1997
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,688
Enslaved

1998
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,712
Designer

1999
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
Frankly that's

2000
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
The college loans

2001
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,624
But not

2002
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,672
Creative Awards

2003
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:00,256
Apparently

2004
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:04,096
Damn well know how to put together a regressive College paper

2005
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,192
Yeah but it seemed like a good gift of theirs

2006
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,520
They talked about

2007
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,568
Like if anybody

2008
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:17,408
Goes against us what we'll do is get their neighbor to fight with them

2009
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
I'm going to look

2010
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:24,576
If they refuse to fight against each other will start a World War

2011
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:27,392
Now looking with Alex Jones says about Syria

2012
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
Says about Ukraine

2013
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,768
He talked about how Ukraine was just globalist meddling in Ukraine

2014
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,048
That wasn't

2015
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
That's exactly what

2016
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,168
The plan of designer

2017
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,728
Says within the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2018
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,520
Alex is conception

2019
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,312
Russia is against the globalist

2020
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
And so in order for them

2021
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,640
To fight against Russia

2022
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,432
They get Ukraine to do it

2023
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,856
HD things in his

2024
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
World

2025
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
That aren't

2026
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,952
Back by fat

2027
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,744
Have to be back by something

2028
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:06,048
Weather weather

2029
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,352
Directly from this or second

2030
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
Hand from this

2031
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,168
This is the root of it

2032
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,960
Antisymmetric fraud

2033
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
Bitterroot

2034
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,264
So much

2035
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,568
Of the reason Alex Jones live

2036
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Sunnyway

2037
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,152
We have one more one more

2038
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Could you read it

2039
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,576
Thanks.

2040
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
The. Of loan supervene

2041
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
And brought all the states

2042
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,144
I really do it you can't really do a lizards

2043
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:46,752
That man could never say any of those words in that sentence

2044
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:52,896
Do you want me to work just a Feen understand but

2045
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
Like

2046
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:58,016
Possibly

2047
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
I guess if

2048
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,600
You just absorbed this

2049
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,160
Bright as a as a worldview

2050
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,000
Because it's not like he's going back and checking

2051
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:11,328
What is the Elders of Zion one of the Elders of Zion

2052
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
And how does it relate

2053
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
It has to be that

2054
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,448
From

2055
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
Young age

2056
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
He was

2057
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
And

2058
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,848
Frankly because I love the word and we've already heard it use more times

2059
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
In this episode

2060
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,408
I think I've heard it

2061
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
My life

2062
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
He has been in

2063
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
With this

2064
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,600
This

2065
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,928
To the point where it is

2066
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Infection

2067
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
Like it's almost a virus

2068
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
Throughout his brain

2069
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
Through this lens

2070
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
The time somebody who is super into the Bible

2071
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,936
The people who are always like

2072
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,520
16 it says you know that

2073
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,080
I believe it's called like a schema

2074
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
Like your psychological

2075
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,688
Dima you build it up

2076
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,272
You filter your experiences through you

2077
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
You filter

2078
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:07,136
Other people through you just create your

2079
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,952
York the building blocks of your psychology

2080
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,000
Through your life and it becomes a lens

2081
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,400
Except of course he's not going back in

2082
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,032
For tomorrow his with his

2083
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:28,128
What is reading adult books

2084
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
When he was sick

2085
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,712
Around that age Maybe

2086
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,272
Reading college-level book

2087
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,672
Conspiracy theorist growing up

2088
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:45,536
Oh yeah that's true probably the best

2089
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,888
There's a real decent chance that his dad in the house had book

2090
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,704
Read that were based

2091
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
On

2092
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:59,872
Protocol

2093
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,688
Understand

2094
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,712
And Incorporated them

2095
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:07,552
So deeply into his schema

2096
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,088
Now it just

2097
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Just become

2098
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,184
What all this other stuff is built

2099
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
Upon without him realize

2100
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,560
And I think at this point I'm ready

2101
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,584
2

2102
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,424
Pulley layout my point and that is that there is no difference

2103
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,240
Then Alex and Alex Jones is globalist

2104
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,544
The Zionist

2105
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,824
Canvas rajul

2106
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Text

2107
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
Except for

2108
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
Vague specific

2109
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,248
Beans in water

2110
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,808
I think that's my larger

2111
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,880
Are you

2112
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,696
Donaldtrump.com

2113
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,448
Besides being overwhelmed by

2114
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,752
Dread

2115
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,776
I don't

2116
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,616
What might my feeling is that this is second

2117
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:06,944
If if not I'd like this is dispense

2118
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,504
As a worldview

2119
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,600
Through the Ages and never like

2120
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
I doubt

2121
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
That Alex

2122
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,512
Has read the protocols of

2123
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:27,168
I disagree I'm sure he's right at some point the first books he bought was mine

2124
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:31,264
Cop cuz he was super interested in it and some lady was at the store

2125
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,848
Like what

2126
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,640
So the fact that he

2127
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
I have told that story on the air

2128
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,456
I'm not saying that he

2129
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Isn't Hitler anything

2130
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
Hitler

2131
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
I don't

2132
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,136
I'm comfortable using that only under the context of like

2133
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
I'm not saying

2134
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,232
Giving out now Nazi or anything like

2135
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,048
Like that but the fact like Sandra Bullock

2136
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,120
Condom

2137
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:09,152
He's willing to go on air and relief

2138
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,432
Express

2139
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
Early on in his life was reading

2140
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
Things that maybe

2141
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,064
Weren't true or where

2142
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
Opposed

2143
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,112
Position

2144
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,648

Mine comp

2146
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,744
I picked up there's literally no way he never read

2147
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
It's a very notarius book

2148
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,352
I did not know I have never heard of it

2149
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:34,752
Before when you started it's very it's very big

2150
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,056
I may have heard about it but it but I never

2151
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,408
Is there hundreds of YouTube videos

2152
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,736
Scrape I did not know that

2153
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,784
There's such a dark underbelly of

2154
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Horrible

2155
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,136
Yep

2156
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,208
Community

2157
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,816
But there is an undercurrent tell me that my girl

2158
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,864
Carrier

2159
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
Kerry Cassidy

2160
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,984
I don't know and I'm not I'm not willing to make that claim but ihe

2161
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
She believes

2162
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,544
Beatles fought in Vietnam

2163
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
Beetle Bailey

2164
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,896
Holyshit

2165
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:19,296
Call Lisa Sheridan

2166
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,880
If the writer of Beetle Bailey is in on it

2167
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:25,696
Everybody's in on it Danby Mort Walker

2168
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:32,352
University of Missouri

2169
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
Achoo on campus

2170
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:40,032
I don't know if you guys out there listening

2171
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,128
To take away from this

2172
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
It is that you need to go to the universe

2173
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:47,968
Missouri

2174
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
Beetle Bailey

2175
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,808
Need to know now I worry that it's

2176
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:56,672
Open taken down I don't know it was

2177
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,208
You apologize

2178
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,536
Statue as much as it was

2179
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:04,608
Like a seated table

2180
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,912
I was like Beetle Bailey was sitting there having a beer

2181
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
Take picture

2182
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:20,480
Where the statue don't have a lot to be proud of the University of Missouri

2183
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:24,320
We had we had like we had

2184
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,624
Who won president

2185
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,648
Who went there

2186
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
Drop the nuke

2187
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
Is our mascot at truman the Tiger

2188
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:40,704
That is a great way to memorialize the president

2189
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:45,056
So that's great will take me to

2190
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:51,968
Brings us to the end of my exploration of the protocols of the Elders of Zion I hope you

2191
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,528
I have enjoyed

2192
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,088
Scared

2193
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,880
And hopefully you're not hopeless

2194
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,696
And I hope that you understand my

2195
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,024
I'm not sure I'm never able to tell if I made my point

2196
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
I hope

2197
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
But I have

2198
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
I don't know

2199
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,680
Yeah Alex Jones is repurposing

2200
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Anti-semitism

2201
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,752
In order to build up his case

2202
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,776
The globalist

2203
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,800
And that's what

2204
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
Behind

2205
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,640
I mean even the Nuvo alt-lite people like

2206
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Even Jack

2207
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,688

2208
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248

Injector sobiech they still rely on sightings the globalist

2213
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:38,560
Some stuff like that which means spiritually they are linked

2214
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
The same mythology that I would

2215
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,656
And has been espousing

2216
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
