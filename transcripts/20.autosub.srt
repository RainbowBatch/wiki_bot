00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,152
Podcast

00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:23,040
Blistery start hazard

00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
Discuss Alex Jones

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Pictures of Chubby Checker level twist I watch tons of Infowars

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
I know a lot about Alex Jones

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,472
And I don't know God damn

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
Where we find our fun

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
But you know realities of life

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
Happened and we didn't promise you s***

13
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
Ale-8

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,184
Nobody would have even said

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
It's a good

16
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,792
We're finally getting an episode instead you like suck you

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
I think I project

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,632
Getting a little bit of anger at myself not because we didn't get

19
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
But because I listened to the

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Show I listen to Alex Jones

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
The entire week

22
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
For what feels like nothing

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
It was a very fruitless Quest

24
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
That makes me very angry

25
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Play hours of Zelda and did not end up freezing an elephant

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
It's a great I've heard nothing

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
Single positive reviews about

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't have a girlfriend

29
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Breath of the Wild

30
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
Record

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
News about the show

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
A video game review show

33
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
Really quick

34
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Decent man all the sudden

35
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
That level of pivot

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Get warmed up

37
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
So I have a couple of out of

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Clips

39
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,048
Alex Jones from the area

40
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
Is all of last week

41
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
March 6th through 10th

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,752
But I reserve the right to go back to that time. More specifically later

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
Okay because the only reason it's basically Monday through Wednesdays or recovering but we have to go to Friday in order

44
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
Interrupting

45
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
Man what the heck

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Alright

47
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Here's the big enchilada

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Butler auto contract drop

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
I've noticed

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,544
Here's the thing I've noticed that

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
He is now a

52
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Best with the

53
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Expressions the big

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Enchilada

55
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
So much

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
I could make a Mastiff

57
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Supercut

58
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
Over a couple days

59
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
But I just have a second

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
The Big Kahuna

61
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
No it's not even related to each other

62
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
They're just both big

63
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Gelato

64
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Motor enchiladas

65
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Kahuna

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Spider-Man GTA

67
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
What is the

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,832
The Big Kahuna is like it's a Hawaiian thing

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Super cool dude man

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
It's not like a an official title

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,888
So it's not like

72
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
The humuhumunukunukuapua'a

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Anyway

74
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
He said it was relish

75
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,224
Some clips on March

76
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Fixed that's Monday

77
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
If you're nasty

78
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
What goes on on this app

79
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
Alex is still in a holding pattern at the

80
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
He is still like

81
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,351
The oldest bad news is coming out about Russia all of these things

82
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
The news hasn't broken at this point

83
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
The point

84
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
General Flynn has

85
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,895
Turkey as well files

86
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
That's great

87
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Papa John's

88
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
You side of things

89
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Clippers how he decides to

90
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
To start the show off

91
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Very dishonor

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
Is a good example of victim card playing

93
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
When that is

94
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
Three weeks ago and general Flynn resigned

95
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
He doesn't develop this in this clip the visit

96
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Basically

97
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Hanging right

98
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Priebus out to dry

99
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Not a bad idea

100
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
To go to people and tell them that they quit

101
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Edit the president has told them

102
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
And then they go in

103
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
I think the news is that true

104
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Telfar

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,831
And everybody else around him

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,183
Guys being

107
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Trump

108
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:56,607
This is f****** insane don't do this anymore absorbed

109
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,799
Kobor likely story than the story of rain

110
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Priebus sneakily going around

111
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
The trick people into resigning

112
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
To what end

113
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
I think to become the president

114
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,183
President of the 4th president United States

115
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
Inaugurated three months

116
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
After we've gone through

117
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
Somehow we're going to be

118
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Cool with him

119
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
How many present

120
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
In a row do you impeach before you just like

121
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Now we're done with this whole America

122
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Here's the good news

123
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Easier as they go along

124
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
If you get used to it

125
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
It's like a it's like committing a burglary

126
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
The first one

127
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
Incredibly difficult

128
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
You got it down

129
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,351
Maybe like

130
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Impeachtrump we get through

131
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
Pence in about a week and a half

132
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Buy Congo

133
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
Like they just murder him on the floor after Scherzer

134
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
Remember Celeste

135
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Just go with

136
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
The devil

137
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,279
I'm assuming

138
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
The oldest person

139
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,959
No the president pro tempore is the oldest traditional

140
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
To the oldest

141
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Remember this

142
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
800

143
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
Angel

144
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
F******

145
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
What's the Strom Thurmond was fourth in line to become president

146
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
4 years

147
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
Oh that makes sense from Thurman who is wondered why that was

148
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
McKay's

149
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
Because he was a well-known social

150
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Rainbow snatch

151
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
Fun in the park

152
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,167
No he's hating on the

153
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Amen

154
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
You got priebus

155
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,159
So then it gets more into like how this exact same thing basically happened

156
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Recession

157
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
But didn't

158
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,191
On Saturday was that President Trump was absolutely infuriated

159
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
That he had not

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,615
Everyday everyday.

161
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
It's in the news everyday

162
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
If you put it in the newspaper you're just doing dog bites man all over again

163
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
Always.

164
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
Trump is mad is taken as read across the board

165
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,631
Went over

166
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
We can't take weeks off

167
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
In future, slightly off and I think we can both feel

168
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,383
Yeah are you getting to the white wine is what

169
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
We always drink red wine or champagne

170
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
And I think this white wine is f****** us up

171
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Okay

172
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Anyway

173
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Was that

174
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,903
The reason the Trump is really mad

175
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Is because

176
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Sessions

177
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Kim

178
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
About resigning

179
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Which is

180
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
Not the role of the Attorney General

181
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Like that

182
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,519
Ethically

183
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
To the president

184
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,615
It was like hey hey bro

185
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Do you want me to recuse myself

186
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
Yeah that's

187
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Incredibly unethical

188
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Of course

189
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
So he's mad because you didn't get to consult

190
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
Even though the Attorney General's office

191
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Executive branch

192
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
The president are

193
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Separate

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Close

195
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
For now

196
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Declarative

197
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Himself also the Attorney General

198
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,639
Over the weekend

199
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
The new

200
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
Trump is dictator for life all of these headlines I can

201
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
Can believe anything is possible except for Alex telling

202
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
Ridiculous

203
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Jeff sessions recuse himself

204
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
He's very clear he was at Watkins talking to them at start again

205
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
A drug has the headline

206
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
When you calling in for the day one

207
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Again we agree that those blocks of water about all of this

208
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
I wouldn't told the reports yesterday and especially

209
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
You watched it

210
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
Sunday show

211
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
The Articles from a month ago

212
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
Wiretap

213
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Organization

214
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
Tracking phone calls out of Trump Tower

215
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
General flange and Russian ambassador

216
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
What's the

217
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
None of them

218
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
Call the President Putin

219
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Exactly zero of that happen

220
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Yeah 100

221
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
Happened in that was accurate

222
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
It's a disgrace to the definite article

223
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
The parts of it that are kind of

224
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Accurate

225
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Representative

226
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
Wiretap Trump

227
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
We already got distracted from

228
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,815
And everybody be like

229
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
Tactic

230
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,311
He's he's jingling keys in front of the press and they're like

231
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
That's what he's doing everybody

232
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
That we all babies up and miss

233
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
My God I think I think we're we're getting off track here

234
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Playful

235
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
I think is white wine is bringing out any unnecessary playfulness

236
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
But it's out of my knowledge fight carrot

237
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
I think I think you're just

238
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Really

239
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Struggling to divorce yourself from the Zelda

240
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Are still wandering about like

241
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,295
Oh look that's beautiful I saved an elephant said open is really cool

242
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Everything is Everything is faking what are you saying

243
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
He's going to

244
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Make some other false equivalence

245
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Is about this exact same stuff later

246
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
But one of the things he doesn't understand is

247
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
What you talkin

248
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Which

249
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Blake Alex Jones

250
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Doesn't understand what he's talking about

251
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
The movie

252
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
The headlock

253
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
When was taken

254
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Game calls

255
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
The set up meetings for Trump

256
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
To talk to them directly about

257
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
But the media twist

258
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
And said they were talking about sex

259
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
The reports from intelligence

260
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Communities

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
You straight talk about sex even then

262
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
The wiretap their talk

263
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
Sing about Loosely I think there

264
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Their bases

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
For this story

266
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Is that there was a server that was connected to

267
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Trump founded

268
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Schenectady

269
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Alfa-bank and that was 80% of its traffic

270
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
Just going back and forth

271
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,711
Emailed

272
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Birthday like

273
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Does Snapchat

274
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Yeah it's specifically setup to be secret

275
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Yeah exactly

276
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Private server

277
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Used

278
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Illicit business

279
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
What if they have

280
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
That we don't have

281
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Who's the president

282
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
Three weeks into Trump's goddamn presidency to find this bull

283
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
Let's speculate

284
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
Have really good spam

285
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,199
That's why you had to set up a separate

286
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Server

287
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,343
What is what's a really good spam email

288
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
It's just

289
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,279
Hunziker

290
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Giving him a lot of money and he's

291
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Great deals

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Real ass memes

293
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
And the other thing is that Alex

294
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Conflate

295
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
The wiretap stuff

296
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
With

297
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
What

298
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
Asserted and that is that Obama did

299
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,879
And that is not true at all

300
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Oklahoma

301
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
That but that's why I think

302
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
Right-thinking people are upset

303
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
People think like

304
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,727
Lying about being wiretapped

305
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
People were looking into stuff

306
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
For good reason

307
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Did I

308
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Instigating him for s***

309
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
He says

310
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
People

311
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
No one really is saying that

312
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
Wildly inappropriate that he's like

313
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
Obama

314
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
That's the part that people are f*****

315
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
That's it

316
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
The thing about that is that

317
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Obama in

318
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
A boogeyman

319
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
That now you can basically

320
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Of course

321
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Done

322
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
As as human beings they're done

323
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,479
The checked out you can just say Obama did anything

324
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Leaves

325
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
And of course Trump with it because that's

326
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
What's the type of thing

327
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
King Trump has

328
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
Has like in Trump's mind if somebody was challenging him for the president

329
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,607
He liked well of course you wiretap them of course

330
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
Exactly

331
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
I think he believes that

332
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Complete

333
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Because he read it

334
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Yeah well

335
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Is another problem that will come up

336
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
But

337
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,367
They were all over the news

338
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Obama

339
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Again again he's applying to the transcript

340
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
The night they are

341
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
They are not

342
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
Last week before all this latest wiretapping bro

343
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,311
New York intelligence

344
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Here he's implying that they gave the in

345
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
Information to the media to

346
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
Through government agency

347
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,439
She's right classification as well as much as possible

348
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
So the fairies

349
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Could share information

350
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:43,423
Executive orders did Obama sign the information that prove that Trump was

351
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Presidents

352
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
Every all just agreed on that yet

353
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,711
Converses

354
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
If you want if you want

355
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Step back

356
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,719
In like not say something that inflammatory you can just

357
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
The Chinese

358
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Grant

359
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Isn't

360
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Definition

361
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
One sentence of

362
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
The Constitution

363
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Says

364
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,055
Don't do that it might as well have

365
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Parentheses

366
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Thomas Jeff

367
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Person in the March

368
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,735
By the way we can see the future in this is Donald Trump

369
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Predicting the future

370
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,159
And nobody is f****** all of the second

371
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Amendment bulshit of like

372
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
F****** window

373
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,703
Just did our first

374
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
Brennan and Clapper and all The Usual Suspects

375
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,575
On TV today

376
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
Preposterous

377
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
The truck says

378
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,007
His transition team was under surveillance and of course. It was found where do you think President Trump got that

379
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Breitbart

380
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,103
Elizabeth

381
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Bored

382
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
Nunez

383
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:41,951
Nothing they're not even phone calls

384
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
Errol Flynn is in there supposedly for the president

385
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Social Security advisor

386
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Winding up his phone calls with world leaders

387
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
Oh okay

388
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
This is just become unbelievable

389
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
So like

390
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
This clip looks really bad

391
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
A week later

392
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,927
It looks real bad now

393
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
Really frustrates me about the whole wire

394
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Bulshit

395
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Is that

396
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Trump

397
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
As president

398
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Could you

399
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Declassify the evidence that he was being wiretapped

400
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
A hundred percent

401
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
If there was ever

402
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,079
That's a total Trump

403
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,663
Is it somebody told him how you can Declassified this these people will be under

404
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Indictment

405
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,759
Tomorrow

406
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,391
And that's something that you should do the globalist

407
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:49,279
Are we moving again and frankly I would do that if I would drop out

408
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:54,655
I would support

409
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,775
It's almost like if there was some sort of shadowy agency infiltrating the

410
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
We would want to get rid of it

411
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
Even if it wasn't from Russia

412
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,247
Question in 10 Spicer's press

413
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,039
Lady asked

414
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
So

415
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:20,256
The proof why is he asking Congress to investigate just provide the

416
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
Heather was Noah

417
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Of course not

418
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Scattered is a

419
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Weasel of the Hyatt

420
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Yeah

421
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Clipped

422
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
From his

423
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
At the end of the week

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
When he was talking

425
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Jobs report

426
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
Dan Howell Trump

427
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Like

428
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
That's terrifying

429
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
From the Prescott

430
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Because

431
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
It's like there in one big room where everybody knows everybody's lying to each other

432
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
Anniversary

433
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
There's nothing we can do

434
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
Like to actually be

435
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
It is it is pretty funny

436
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
That he's just caught in a bald-faced lie and just double down

437
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,304
Haha like we're f******

438
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,376
Yeah and we're not even bothering to lie about

439
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
He's out of

440
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Almost

441
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
That's the comic side of right

442
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
Performance

443
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
Cackle like a witch

444
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
Battle B2

445
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,944
Domino's bumbling

446
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
Meditite

447
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
But

448
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
That goes on to cite

449
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
About

450
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Attention span

451
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
And how everyone in the world is stupid

452
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
I am in Tilton more lies about you

453
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Do you think he gets

454
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Distracted

455
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Halfway through the attempt

456
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
In Spanish

457
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Movie 3/4

458
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,472
Because he's not like he's not a lemming

459
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
It's not at 9

460
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,848
Dumb piece of s*** low-information liberal

461
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
All the time

462
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Actually pay attention to those really goes on and government and a note was released

463
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Are so stupid

464
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
I don't have a 7 second

465
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,848
Have less than goldfish

466
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
Neither of those goldfish

467
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
Famously

468
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Have a five-second

469
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
Memory span except

470
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
That's a lie

471
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
They don't

472
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,232
Junk science

473
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
The fair in this in this

474
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Okay the study I looked into it

475
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
Goldfish

476
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Is what they say

477
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
They say it

478
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
The truth is

479
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,896
Studies on children

480
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,504
Attention span used to be like 12 seconds and it's gone down to eight

481
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,552
Since the Advent of

482
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Handheld

483
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,600
Phone

484
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,672
You can use the internet on

485
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Made it expands go down

486
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
The same study cited that

487
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
A byproduct

488
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
Also

489
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
Is it our ability to both

490
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
C task is gone up dramatically

491
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Ratso there is a

492
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Kind of

493
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:48,128
You have to do when your obvious bulshit all the time

494
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
Celebrity culture stuff

495
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
Liars from Alex

496
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
You have to not

497
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Thanks for very long

498
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
Goodyear

499
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Move on to the next thing that grabs your attention

500
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
So that is

501
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Kind of just

502
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
The neuro flexibility of human

503
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
In the meantime

504
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,120
Because we move on from things really quick were able to juggle more balls

505
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
I think it's a fair trade-off

506
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,704
In terms of our brain

507
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,544
You know I have no idea whether or not there's a valuable

508
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Conclusion to draw from

509
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
From any of that

510
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
Certainly not the related to

511
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,224
Whatever

512
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
What's going on there

513
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Further

514
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
I don't think it would be possible that anyone could have

515
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Plan

516
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
Smartphones out

517
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
It's going to take

518
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,488
33%

519
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,048
Are 25% off people's attention span

520
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
What about somebody

521
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
12

522
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
F****** dementia

523
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,776
Did you report it

524
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
Demons you're right

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
They're doing it all simultaneously

526
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
I always forget about the dementia

527
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
You got to remember

528
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Either TV volume

529
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Hypotenuse

530
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:10,816
Do not believe or remember that a month ago it was on every TV channel

531
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
Every News Channel every newspaper everywhere that they had surveilled Trump and Slimline

532
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Talked about

533
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
With the Russian ambassador

534
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Release the transcript

535
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,416
I'm sure you can bring that up with me

536
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,024
Did you decide

537
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,704
Line up a discussion about them absolutely real government

538
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,824
And in-wall they trained everybody who answer exactly as their ass because

539
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
They don't want a bunch of obfuscation

540
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,456
Which is why you like sex

541
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Trouble in the first place

542
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
He answered

543
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Exactly as he

544
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Wasn't asked

545
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
No that's

546
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
That's right

547
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,048
Al Franken a question

548
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:19,168
Anybody have contact

549
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
No we've been over this a hundred times

550
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,264
Alex Jones quote

551
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
He doesn't understand

552
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,504
It's so f****** frustrating auto quotes

553
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,368
What about even though he just said basically the same thing

554
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
INR last clip

555
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
Is because

556
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,744
I wanted to illustrate a little bit the repetitiveness

557
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Rats and how

558
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,376
You just says the same things over and over again that part through

559
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,704
To your mind if you're not paying attention

560
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Oh yeah I guess that you know

561
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,568
When did get set up I guess sessions was a state

562
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Lawyer lie Quest

563
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Mayweather

564
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Not

565
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
A question he wasn't

566
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
And answered it poorly

567
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Cuz he was

568
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Nervous cuz he was

569
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
Because

570
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Is a

571
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,232
Colluding

572
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,048
Terrified if I was in front of the Senate

573
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,120
And I was up to some s***

574
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,960
Which again is another reason to respect Hillary all the

575
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
Cuz she lied for like twelve straight hours

576
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
Versace had that level of a

577
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
No way

578
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,272
Stone Cold

579
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Yeah great

580
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,256
It's so great in the same Obama

581
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,072
It's time to just move on from Hillary

582
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,032
We have a lot of Evans

583
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
Hey it is someone is like

584
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
My schedule

585
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
If you're in the NSA email note

586
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
Letters to the editor

587
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
Text Alex isn't the first

588
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
The two instances where

589
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Sorta gets into

590
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
Talking to Trump on the phone

591
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
He gets into

592
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
Again he's inability to understand nuance

593
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
And the

594
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Between different kinds of meetings

595
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
The politicians

596
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Incredibly embarrassing

597
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Calls

598
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
Another new listings

599
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
And look up

600
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
Where they said that they had all these communications out of Trump Tower

601
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,200
That's really good advice for like the guy in memento

602
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
If you don't have a memory

603
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,648
Go back and check the new movie that would be if the internet was around

604
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:25,792
Holyshit cell phone

605
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
Advanced technology helps everybody

606
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,400
Really lucky

607
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
Specific time history

608
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Movie though

609
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Like it

610
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
There wasn't anything there

611
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
It was Sophie

612
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,176
Call Celine

613
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Whatever I forget the number

614
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:01,376
World leaders and royalty and Business Leaders all day but you're on the list is your Lester's

615
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
We're so awesome

616
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,960
For their support this big Windward

617
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
I don't know if

618
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
True or not

619
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,664
It seems plausible based on what we know and yet it's

620
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
The same time

621
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
Equally as possible that he just

622
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Decided to make that up

623
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
It is possible you're right but then on the other hand we also know that Alex is a liar

624
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:31,584
Oh no to Alex

625
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Is that just toss the ball up in the air

626
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:38,240
Is punt on a cold beer made out of happen

627
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
It's not as important

628
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Is what Alex

629
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
Says his response

630
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
To that is

631
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:47,712
Call me back I want to call you and call and royalty

632
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
But I had call you cuz you listeners are awesome

633
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Here is what Alex's response

634
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Nice call

635
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
I would say

636
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
If it did happen that's a really nice guy

637
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Scott it's misguided as f***

638
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
Call

639
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
I would have I would have preferred if it were me and I were propaganda I would have preferred a letter with the present

640
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
You could put that on

641
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
Tell your grandkids about you know what

642
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,320
Swim in the water

643
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,672
Which group is worse

644
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
It's probably proof

645
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
Oh s***

646
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:39,936
Oh s*** I have to be exactly

647
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,984
On the phone with Russia everything is recorded

648
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,800
So here's Alex's restore unless you're deleting

649
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Typos and f******

650
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Open Twitter

651
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:53,504
I want sure they are going to come after you they're never going to stop by now he's going to get both prosperity and

652
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,368
Got to go after you got to get on the offense because they're going to come after you

653
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,744
You wouldn't even say like how are you doing

654
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
What shoes are coming for you

655
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
Need your bones

656
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
What's Superfly Nisbet

657
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
Because he's clunky with language

658
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
It kind of makes it sound like his listeners are going to come for a pronoun

659
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
Iraq

660
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:26,784
Canada our private conversation

661
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
But he doesn't heat the ultra-high

662
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Yes

663
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
The president just wants to turn the car back on and that's why hire Road

664
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
He doesn't want hurt small businesses the average person so

665
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
Beaches

666
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
So that's actually just Alex literally verbatim

667
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,432
Dropping

668
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Trump

669
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,064
Like the idea that he could sit back and watch Obamacare and plug

670
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Just want to do that to people

671
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,392
Is directly out of

672
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
He did say that

673
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Yeah

674
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Just hit

675
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
The weirdest thing

676
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Listen to this

677
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
This is that

678
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
And it's like

679
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Absolutely

680
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
0

681
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,288
Steps

682
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Towards even

683
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
Pretending to make the middle classes life better

684
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
None

685
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,712
No no small businesses are improved

686
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
Well

687
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Nothing if you are 0 positive

688
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,160
Things that he's done for the very people Alex Jones doesn't exist

689
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Are the only people he cares

690
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
If you listen to Alex

691
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
He does site

692
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Ad nauseam

693
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
That the stock market is

694
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
Going up

695
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
Middle-class or poor people

696
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Because you don't have

697
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
Stop

698
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,592
All those stocks are businesses that are able to

699
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Employee people

700
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,688
The stock market goes up those businesses are doing better

701
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:02,528
That helps the Common Man

702
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,600
It's duck

703
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,672
I'm sorry every time somebody says trickle-down I just

704
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
I have a stroke

705
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Flames

706
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
I don't think that's the last time you're going to barking this episode

707
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
And he's been dumb

708
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
The entire

709
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
What they just keep the money and he's like

710
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Shut up boy

711
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,712
You you know that they would because history number one and they already ever ever hear about it

712
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
You would do probably

713
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
I know I'd wiretap Obama that's for damn sure had a couple times like Bank errors and a

714
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,232
Accidentally given me like 20 extra bucks

715
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
Good business is a dick

716
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Okay so the other thing

717
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Is that

718
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
He constantly talks about

719
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,824
The small business

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
Confidence index

721
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
And stuff like that people are more optimistic than ever before

722
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
Which

723
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
I don't know about

724
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
I literally don't know about

725
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
Little liberal bubbles but

726
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
I mean

727
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
I'm trying to read all the

728
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
Conservative news that I

729
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
They are not

730
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Optimistic

731
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,096
PetSmart conservative news

732
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Really Optimus

733
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Super

734
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Breitbart

735
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,152
Yeah they're doing a lot better

736
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,224
Let's get back into this

737
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
We're going to get to the point

738
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Right here where we talked about the

739
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
He's meeting

740
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
He just doesn't understand the difference between like we talked about

741
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,464
People having public and private

742
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Understand that at all

743
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,072
Everything going on

744
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
Morning

745
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
And

746
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,192
Trump is so good

747
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Sick to my stomach

748
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,416
Again he only uses those ref

749
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,720
Because he has that clip of them

750
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Yeah

751
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Petty

752
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,536
Stupid

753
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
Yeah and it's proof that he doesn't have

754
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,704
If he has anything he wouldn't have to keep going back to Maxine Waters saying

755
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
Premier

756
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
It is one of those thing

757
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Things that by rep

758
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Petition he's created a

759
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
It created like a

760
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,224
So we can always go back to

761
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,528
To that area

762
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Yeah

763
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
Reenact

764
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:03,264
All over again and then that kind of like

765
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,080
Pavlovian response

766
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
Yeah Liberals are dumb

767
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
Have to take forever to rebuild itself

768
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
It's that really stupid

769
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
Very bad

770
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
Effective

771
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Clearly

772
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,952
I would like to see

773
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
What's coming up at the end of this episode

774
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,376
We have a return of Eddie Bravo episodes

775
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,704
So get excited for that

776
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:39,616
We never met with Russian Ambassador and they're just photo after photo of Schumer and Pelosi

777
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
Public

778
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,808
Brazil and Mexico are powerful yeah they are there people aren't there

779
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Going on

780
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
Yes there are

781
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
I don't just

782
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Fat at all

783
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
People

784
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
What's heads-of-state

785
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
In official capacity

786
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Do you think that he

787
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
I mean I'm not sure if he understands

788
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Is the difference in a

789
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
Purpose

790
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
Because to him it seems like

791
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
A meetings a meeting

792
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,832
Read whatever on the record off the Record you're doing it's still a meeting so does

793
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
Mater yeah

794
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,792
If he were to say you know what I bet other people have had off-the-record meetings with

795
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Before

796
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
I would actually be inclined to believe

797
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Surprise me

798
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,800
You know Schumer

799
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Can't say that

800
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
F***

801
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,432
I've got to do some investigative journalism

802
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
I can't do it

803
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
But he was at

804
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,528
Actually prove a point

805
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
And if you say that though

806
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Purposefully lying

807
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
About not knowing

808
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
The different type

809
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
He says you know it's Alyssa

810
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
The record

811
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
That also mean

812
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,888
It's Alyssa that

813
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
When did these meetings Austin

814
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
That's a really good point to

815
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Not under

816
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Understand

817
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,664
Romantic fascinator

818
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Send it

819
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
He has to not understand

820
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
The only the only way to be safe

821
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Is being really dumb

822
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
S*** parents is

823
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
If I'm not

824
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,656
I think that where we go next

825
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
Is equipped

826
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
Bees v 7

827
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,336
His come out

828
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
On wikileak

829
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
When this happened

830
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
He just becomes a new man

831
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,904
You know how when he lost Google

832
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,744
He became a totally different person

833
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Nna Petty

834
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
Money-grubbing

835
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,840
Kind of way

836
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,424
Vault 7

837
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
And stuff comes out

838
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Is like

839
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
A weight is lifted from his shoulders

840
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,872
And he believes that he's been proven right

841
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
About everything

842
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
Throughout his entire life

843
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,015
Everything that you set on air is totally true

844
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,319
And that means that everything he's going to say

845
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,671
Is going to be true until the truth

846
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,999
And it gets into this like a cult leader getting the Apocalypse

847
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:14,399
The look on his face

848
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
12 year olds

849
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Dammit

850
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Yeah

851
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
There's a little bit of that

852
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,871
But that's a that's a pitch for a TV show

853
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,479
The cult leader whose accidentally always right accidental leader

854
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
Yeah

855
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
So get this clip Alex tells a little bit

856
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
The story of his past

857
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:43,071
That's why this is an intriguing question

858
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,863
Directions with Nazi police officer

859
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
After is about

860
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
Him as a broadcaster

861
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
And I don't think

862
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
I really really really don't

863
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,271
Can't stress enough

864
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Bulshit

865
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,559
All right I think it's time to go

866
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
Directions

867
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
Also I just realized I think we're technically in his eyes globalist

868
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
I could

869
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
I'm going to do voice over for that movie

870
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
I just

871
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Because we're

872
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Is is anime

873
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,607
Philosophically and ideologically we would obviously

874
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,167
Clearly have to be in the employ of the global

875
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,007
I think that is the only way that's the only conclusion

876
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
I'm not

877
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,615
I'm not

878
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,175
That's the reason that they got me I'm here to watch you

879
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,527
Was minion this keep an eye on

880
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,951
What if you go full-on Apocalypse Now

881
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Oh no

882
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,767
Diesel mechanic

883
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,351
I can assure you that I've I've gone this far down the path

884
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
I'm pretty face

885
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
I don't think there's any

886
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,263
It's going to happen to miss about thesaurus

887
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Looking

888
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,639
I say hi

889
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,479
Horses

890
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:43,647
Dysfunctional

891
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:51,071
You have been undermined for decades and the Patriots inside our government others have been quiet

892
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
Absolutely complete

893
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Not your overthrow

894
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
But your lips

895
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
Because you can't overthrow something

896
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,831
Remote control in all the airplanes for at least 25 years

897
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,183
Remote control your car right off of bridge

898
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,767
Ago

899
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,327
The television set for watching and listening

900
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,471
Your regular smartphone

901
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,055
Whatever one like the only one saying that s***

902
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
George Orwell

903
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
It granted

904
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
He is

905
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:44,575
A lot of that stuff I think even he surprised that he was right

906
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,903
If you take out all of the stuff

907
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Come true that was

908
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
Paranoid bulshit

909
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
And only cherry pick

910
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,119
These examples

911
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:03,519
If you're paranoid about everything you're going to be right a couple times paranoid doesn't mean they're not

912
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,383
Republic

913
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
Like a lot of these things were public

914
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
It's not that

915
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:18,879
Describe what things are public people could hack into your computer

916
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
Camera

917
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,583
Technology have been aware of and had been warning

918
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,655
Not like Alex Jones cracked the case

919
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Anything like that

920
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
And I don't think he would even say that

921
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
You did

922
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Maybe

923
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Only thought about looking

924
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
Looking for it because he told them

925
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Cuz he had

926
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,111
The globalist information

927
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,159
People were globalism

928
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Woke them

929
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
With his knowledge

930
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
I read bill.

931
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
This stuff is really hard for us

932
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
To deal with I believe

933
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Because

934
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,335
It is a point where I know you well enough to know

935
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,407
Hollister

936
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
But Technologies pretty scare

937
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
It's very a lot of the stuff that they can do with technology is really really scary

938
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
Against these things

939
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
The ability to

940
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
Computers

941
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Philosophical

942
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
We shouldn't

943
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
Like its

944
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
Could be abused

945
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Terribly

946
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:39,263
Some sort of autocratic president

947
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Slipping grip on Power Inn

948
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
That would be really

949
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
Fascinating of all the sudden we start

950
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,575
Movies leaks on every politician

951
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Aries with him

952
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,159
There's got to be stuff

953
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Right

954
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
The problem

955
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,119
The problem with the you know what Snowden revealed about the wide net

956
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
That they're doing where they're just saving

957
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
All of these

958
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
Is that it doesn't help

959
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
To stop terrorism

960
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
There's too much noise

961
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,103
You know you can't find the signal

962
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,919
It does help if you are looking

963
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:21,247
You know you have all this information

964
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,087
Time to go digging through

965
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Preventative

966
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
Play so if you want to release them if

967
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Like you could

968
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
Is there have a secret

969
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,631
You can put that out there immediately there discredited or whatever

970
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,727
All of the new Wikileaks dump because it's

971
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
Yeah

972
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,591
Literally no way Alex could have

973
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
By the neck

974
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,383
Day on air

975
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
He might be a literate

976
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,783
Yeah there's no way you could skim a couple headline

977
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
Here and there would seem to be his motive

978
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:02,975
But there's no way he can have a nuanced understanding of what's in there what is actually being revealed

979
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
And he just

980
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,815
In the time since then

981
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
Assessments and Analysis

982
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,679
By people who were in

983
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Like information

984
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
And basically

985
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
The dump that happened

986
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
Is dangerous

987
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Because

988
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,991
Does illustrate a lot of tools that are at the disposal

989
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
Of the CIA and other intelligence agency

990
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,111
Does not indicate in any way that these

991
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
These things were used

992
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
On citizen

993
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Didn't know I mean

994
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
No

995
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,535
It doesn't point if there is no smoke

996
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,143
You get you get a chance to play with

997
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:47,519
You know like even if it's not been used maliciously from a government

998
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
CIA dude has seen your naked

999
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
Right it has

1000
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,967
It doesn't matter

1001
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
You know it I know it dudes are awful

1002
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
It happened

1003
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,111
It's probable

1004
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,183
I have to I'll give you that much

1005
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
It's likely

1006
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
But

1007
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,535
It's not what Alex

1008
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
She says

1009
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,655
Proved killed Michael Hastings by running

1010
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Okay

1011
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Which is better

1012
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,359
They're going to need a little bit more than

1013
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,175
Just short of saying like the Malaysian plane

1014
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
So f******

1015
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
Far on this and that everybody's

1016
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
TV is listening to them

1017
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
It's like

1018
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Like in that book

1019
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,231
1954's paranoid fantasies

1020
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
There's a slight confirmation that these tools in the back doors are available to people in intelligent

1021
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
Using that in

1022
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Information

1023
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,215
Is confirmation of his paranoid fan

1024
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,287
He's been having for years

1025
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,871
And also they haven't had it for as long as

1026
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,991
Find me the back doors

1027
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
They have an iOS

1028
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
And those

1029
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,879
You know those have been around for that

1030
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,463
And they will be around for longer at all

1031
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,023
Which is the

1032
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,351
For all the weird and awful WikiLeaks

1033
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
They did this time

1034
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Like say

1035
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,983
Hey we're not going to publish all of the weight

1036
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
To get into the iOS

1037
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
Send the Android operating

1038
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,871
So they can closes

1039
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
Oh they did

1040
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,223
Oh that's great they haven't done it they are going to

1041
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,807
But they're going to wait until Apple and Android closes

1042
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Okay

1043
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:42,207
Cuz that would be a data reader is hacker tool

1044
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
Purposefully found these

1045
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
And ask

1046
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,815
Them to stay in there

1047
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,839
And not reveal them

1048
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,143
Is the most dangerous

1049
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Yeah I guess

1050
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
If you're in the government

1051
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,007
That helps you in a certain way but that also mean

1052
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
They exist

1053
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:59,359
Yeah and somebody will find them and it's there

1054
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:05,759
Exist for a reason the only reason for that is to bypass your privacy

1055
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,295
Insecurities

1056
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Is it

1057
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,623
The small point

1058
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
In which we agree without

1059
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
All the rest of it

1060
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Why is it

1061
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
I don't know

1062
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:29,055
It seems inconsistent I want to know apparently there's my paranoid fantasy at huh

1063
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
Beating up that like

1064
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,871
Trump is already dropped more bombs

1065
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
An Obama did in a year

1066
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Perfect

1067
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,015
Play some America

1068
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,087
Yep he's already gone golfing more time

1069
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,159
That Obama did it in any year Melania cost

1070
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
Some ridiculous that like Fifty like half a million dollars at goddamn day

1071
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,447
Million a week of every single American is paying for her to

1072
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,471
Her husband

1073
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
Well that's bad

1074
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,311
That's the part where we get into fantasy narrative

1075
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
We don't know if it's

1076
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Because she hates

1077
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Trough

1078
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,199
It seems like there's no other

1079
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:12,831
The only other explanation errands got to go to school matter

1080
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:23,071
Blame her for that day I just realized that we still haven't gotten to the point where Alex Telles

1081
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
All the lying about his

1082
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:33,311
Unpack that Wikileaks thing a little bit and I'm glad without calling Julian Assange a Russian agent

1083
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
We told you everything

1084
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:46,879
And because Patriots inside the different agencies

1085
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Was

1086
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,183
Adopt

1087
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
Not official

1088
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,791
As a place to dump information

1089
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
The

1090
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,359
The technical head

1091
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
What the tech

1092
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,199
I don't know if you means

1093
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
Head of Technology

1094
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,255
Like we're going to get into one of them later

1095
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
Pieczenik

1096
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
CIA

1097
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:32,191
He was like a psychiatrist psychiatrist Within

1098
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,311
I don't know but he's crazy

1099
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Yeah

1100
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
Nut

1101
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
These people who Alex gets on

1102
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Some of them to have

1103
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
The history of the servicemen what-have-you

1104
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
But they lost it

1105
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,343
Yeah or or they never had it which is

1106
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
Is even scarier

1107
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,719
Equally possible Street Preacher crazy

1108
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
They've they've got it

1109
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Together enough

1110
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
They can tell a story

1111
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,191
Like how did Buzz Aldrin insist that there were people on mars or something like that

1112
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Yeah

1113
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
That's the beginning of

1114
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,687
Is

1115
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,759
The Milton everything right because the military

1116
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,807
Unofficially decided

1117
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,879
We know we can trust Alex Jones

1118
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,695
To disseminate this information because no one's going to

1119
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
Conspiracy theory community

1120
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
Is that he's being trick

1121
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Intelligence

1122
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,007
They give him one corrected for

1123
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
Piece of information in for lies

1124
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:47,199
It's basically so they're just playing a game

1125
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,991
Is to discredit Alley

1126
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
Essentially

1127
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Has the truth

1128
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,135
Okay it's stupid

1129
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
Stupid

1130
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,743
Stupid dumb people are out Dumb and Dumber

1131
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,023
What you just described

1132
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
More or less

1133
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
But it's

1134
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,775
Clay Madsen

1135
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
We've been absolutely On Target

1136
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
Never about them

1137
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Never ever listen

1138
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
To him

1139
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,575
Just once I wanted to be like

1140
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:29,183
Hey give us some credit this is pretty good

1141
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Censored stuff

1142
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,631
Cuz we just here every every clip it's like

1143
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
Look I know we're amazed

1144
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:45,311
It's possibility I know I'm right all the time but I don't want

1145
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:50,175
He's big into the false humility game but then he's also big into the I'm being victimized

1146
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,479
Which are very difficult games

1147
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
Play simultaneous

1148
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:58,623
Cuz if you play victim game it's I'm awesome and someone else is holding me back

1149
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:02,975
Breakpoint

1150
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
It's very difficult

1151
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,703
What is $1

1152
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,407
Set an alarm visual groups

1153
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,479

1154
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,039
In the CIA in the NSA

1155
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,599
And the geospatial group in all of them

1156
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,559
This guy's young he's wild but he's done the research and has horses

1157
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,143
He's dead on this is the voice of America

1158
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
Lego shows

1159
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
He just described Point Break

1160
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
Is wild

1161
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,871
Utah The Voice of America.

1162
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,223
Unless maybe go with Lethal Weapon

1163
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,063
He's Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon

1164
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,367
The military

1165
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
Alex Jones

1166
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
What do you mean

1167
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,279
What do you mean

1168
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
Play football

1169
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,447
How much water in Texas

1170
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,847
He was an undercover

1171
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
Golden State Warriors

1172
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,759
That's true it's family is here

1173
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Cheese's

1174
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
This isn't it

1175
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:50,239
I miss Mortenson Postino got calls they're like yeah we got ordered

1176
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567

1177
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:59,967
All the fucken what

1178
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
They got ordered to listen to Alex

1179
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
It's an order

1180
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,623
You think it's been the same thing like SEAL Team Six

1181
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:13,023
The same guys for the past 12 years

1182
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,447
You can fly goddamn helicopter like a motherfuker

1183
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,983
He always keeps

1184
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Feet dry

1185
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,567
Bridges important country

1186
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
Infowars

1187
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:37,343
You don't even listen to Infowars

1188
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
I do

1189
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
So there is that

1190
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:47,071
That's right I got my marching orders from himself

1191
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Disc

1192
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,447
That's what that's what George Soros

1193
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
Sounds like

1194
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
His glass still more convinced

1195
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
Alex Jones

1196
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,383
Anyway you still haven't gotten

1197
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Come to the death

1198
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
We resisted we stood up

1199
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,087
Infowars Is On Target

1200
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
Trump

1201
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
About that

1202
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,999
It's amazing I can't believe intelligence Community loves you so much

1203
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
Set alarm for 20 years

1204
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,863
Wow yeah I'm just going to learn about all this

1205
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,727
The two thing the intelligence community that trunks hates loves Alex so much

1206
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Will trump

1207
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
Just surprised by

1208
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,615
Narrative

1209
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,431
Elgin Stadium

1210
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Community Bank

1211
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
Right

1212
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
The chicken neck sorry

1213
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,719
Pencil pushing chicken necks

1214
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,815
With their American flag

1215
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
Absolutely

1216
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
They do not like

1217
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:07,199
Is a liar

1218
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,807
The end is that like

1219
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,855
He says that in his phone calls with Trump

1220
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,159
I'm just starting to learn about these things

1221
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,999
Which undercuts The Narrative that he's been in Americana Sleeper Cell

1222
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
Since he was 20

1223
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,351
Well he's just starting to learn about the real death

1224
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
Save the globe

1225
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Confirm the same

1226
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Playbook

1227
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
But Alex was getting the information straight from the end

1228
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,055
You may be right

1229
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,151
Trump is just been being the good man you know it

1230
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
Great man

1231
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
Information he would be compromised

1232
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
That's a good point

1233
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,879
Also I don't have a clip of this but there's a point where Alex goes into the story about getting

1234
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,415
So like classified document

1235
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,695
When he was younger

1236
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,351
Like The Neverending Story like he goes into a library and find

1237
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,167
Magical

1238
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,823
The way he says he got there with some guy pulled up in a car and gave it to it

1239
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
You can get we got to burn these without my dad

1240
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,415
Regis Burnham

1241
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
They're trying to set you up with

1242
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,999
What does classified information

1243
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
You're going to go down

1244
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
So they burned the dock

1245
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
Well I see

1246
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,399
That's even

1247
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,471
Because the only way to really get rid of those.

1248
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
Is to boil them downright

1249
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Silver filling

1250
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:41,151
We all know that how do you get rid of a body

1251
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Turn it into filling

1252
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Everybody knows

1253
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:48,831
Turn it into non-fluoride toothpaste dentist

1254
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
That's just his cover

1255
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Anyway

1256
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:55,487
You want to know Trump's work ballast right

1257
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:01,631
Mocontrol planes

1258
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,727
I know this

1259
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,335
Engineers in Austin at work very well

1260
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
It's a good thing they were very wealthy

1261
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
Say that way we know we

1262
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
We love the rich

1263
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,831
Thanks for pointing that out

1264
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
But also the other idea there if you really unpack what he saying is like

1265
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,839
Have no proof of it

1266
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
This should work

1267
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
It's not journalism

1268
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,263
Lucked out

1269
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,639
You hit some sort of lottery I don't believe the store

1270
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:51,039
In the realm of a believing the story the story is unbelievable

1271
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,135
If it's true just

1272
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,463
It's not good good life

1273
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:02,047
College

1274
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
There's no wind

1275
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,143
But it's so delightful

1276
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
Like

1277
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,823
Of kind of boring subdued Alex

1278
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
This kind of thing is

1279
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
Is delicious it's just such a nice

1280
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Oasis

1281
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,855
Bill Clinton ordered people to surveil me he ordered from our Intel people to beat me up

1282
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:31,743
Breaking my house URL

1283
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,423
The decision was made

1284
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:45,823
Persecuted me up front and then what the hell are we doing

1285
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
Real

1286
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,439
That we at least 15 16 years

1287
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
Hardcore

1288
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,567
He's got on this is the program

1289
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,687
Google read

1290
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:28,831
Books and you go read Bertrand Russell book and you go read a book

1291
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,695
170 years old most of a 67 years old 30-40 years old

1292
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
I just read all the books

1293
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
WhatsApp

1294
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
They're not they're trying to act cool

1295
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
I did it

1296
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,615
You are I love how I love how it goes immediately from

1297
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Community was

1298
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,711
Tell listen to me because I'm

1299
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:00,063
Only one who's the greatest

1300
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
Broadcaster in history

1301
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
To tell you how great I am

1302
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:10,815
False humility you guys know

1303
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
This is

1304
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,935
The delusions of grandeur

1305
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
Within that

1306
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
Credible

1307
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,687
We're getting to like

1308
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,247
Talking over that cliff

1309
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,783
He doesn't say what

1310
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,623
It's all in there

1311
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
You haven't read these books

1312
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
What's in the books

1313
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,511
Just been reading the globalist book

1314
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,071
140 years old

1315
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,095
Is he then

1316
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
Saying that the

1317
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Technology

1318
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Watch 3

1319
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,543
More less the plans

1320
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,175
JK Rowling

1321
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,479
Where you can just wave your hand with

1322
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Yeah

1323
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,599
We have also put a really fine point

1324
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
So

1325
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,719
Making the point that he's done the research

1326
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,023
You studied these things and he's right about everything

1327
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
It's by the grace

1328
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
God that

1329
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,983
We've consistently

1330
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,775
Shown that he doesn't know

1331
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
About the

1332
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
Is basically Alex Jones

1333
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,319
Can't read right

1334
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,343
I've read all these books

1335
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,159
I don't trust your ability to read those books

1336
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,463
I don't I don't listen to him

1337
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,255
I don't want to read these books

1338
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
To be honest

1339
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,143
So I'm not going to go to review

1340
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,215
Take the new running

1341
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:57,823
Think of debugging Alex I got Zelda to play I guarantee it

1342
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
They wouldn't

1343
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
Very humbly

1344
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:17,279
Trump

1345
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
What

1346
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,783
And no they can't

1347
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,719
The news

1348
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,071
Trump's Russian

1349
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,911
False flag

1350
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
What

1351
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,519
At the claims and they were fake

1352
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,295
Anime world the whole thing up

1353
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,695
He's saying that in WikiLeaks

1354
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
The CIA

1355
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,791
Specifically points out that they have the

1356
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
Tools

1357
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,327
2

1358
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,375
False flag Russian operator

1359
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Nations against Trump

1360
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
No

1361
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,727
Well no not really

1362
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,591
Showed is the

1363
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
CIA does have like

1364
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,687
Russian origin malware

1365
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,759
Confiscated or found

1366
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,807
Russia has some of our

1367
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:52,255
He then makes the leap to all of this stuff is what was used for the Russian hacking

1368
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,815
Which is absolutely not true

1369
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,351
There are good

1370
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,143
Resources

1371
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,703
Don't fully understand

1372
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
But I understand enough

1373
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,335
These malware things that are in the WikiLeaks

1374
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,103
Or not.

1375
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
Specific one

1376
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
Better the code

1377
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
Booze found

1378
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
Proven by these WikiLeaks

1379
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Is that not true

1380
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,439
The bigger issue

1381
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,231
Is the Alex

1382
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,071
Having presented himself as someone who talks

1383
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
The Trump on the phone

1384
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:32,959
This little bit where is a water released this stuff

1385
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
Which

1386
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:36,287
Why Trump released through Wiki

1387
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
A little bit

1388
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,639
Oh man

1389
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,967
Because the globalist won't leave him alone

1390
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Now if that's

1391
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,159
And we do know that Flynn communicated with guccifer

1392
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,487
Rodger Stone

1393
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,839
That's right so stop for knowledge for knowledge's

1394
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
I mean

1395
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:06,239
Because we're using the term sort of loosely I want to make it clear that we don't think WikiLeaks

1396
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,799
There's a separation of

1397
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
They get the information

1398
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,639
A very strange

1399
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
Power structure

1400
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,807
The hierarchy there is pretty I just noticed that we were saying WikiLeaks

1401
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,135
I want to leave it

1402
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,183
They just get it and throw it out there

1403
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,583
Soapstone has connections

1404
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,863
Knows in advance

1405
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Is coming

1406
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,983
Yeah there's one connection

1407
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
There

1408
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,103
Because

1409
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,943
What was his defense there that it was just like what everybody

1410
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:52,575
Lucifer

1411
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,671
And that also was a benign conversation

1412
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
9 conversation can you have

1413
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,839
He went on Alex's or Rogers.

1414
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,863
Stone does not have

1415
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
Have any

1416
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,471
No sir

1417
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,007
Or talkin

1418
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
You know he has a tattoo of Nixon space on his back

1419
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:21,247
That's not true I refuse to I don't want to live in this

1420
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
This world

1421
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
You just

1422
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,367
You just proved that there is no point in

1423
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Is any of us

1424
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:34,303
Notorious liar and a republican dirty trickster for like the last

1425
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
4050

1426
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:39,423
Aboveboard is just

1427
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Spreadable Luna

1428
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,263
Anybody who is word is

1429
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,287
The f****** idiot

1430
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
But we do know

1431
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
He has these contacts

1432
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Text with Ricky Lee

1433
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Guccifer

1434
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
2.0

1435
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
It's not

1436
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
I don't know what it was

1437
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,303
It maybe it was just information digging or something like that

1438
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,887
But still f***** up phone know what it was

1439
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,935
Someone does someone have

1440
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,055
Why can't we just get

1441
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,591
Everything points

1442
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,639
Possible conclusion

1443
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,919
Yeah

1444
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,479
It's all a weird system of

1445
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,247
What happened

1446
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Like everybody's

1447
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,111
So it's either there's collusion there

1448
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:36,511
Or it's like a drawing-room far swear everybody

1449
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:40,607
Then they come out of a different door and they look at each other like I didn't know you were there and

1450
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,215
Is it a 23 company

1451
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
Basically or it's like murder on the Orient

1452
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,591
Express everybody killed

1453
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:56,991
New exactly everybody on this train independently killed this guy

1454
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,319
There's multiple endings

1455
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
Dumb people

1456
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,903
Have to have enough information

1457
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
By this

1458
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
There's no

1459
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Possible way there isn't enough information

1460
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
To go one way or the other

1461
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,351
Rodger Stone might be closed

1462
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
To getting a real Polonia

1463
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
Poisoning

1464
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
I will

1465
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
Isaac he's in danger

1466
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
The ambassador's dying

1467
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Yeah

1468
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,079
A witch even then

1469
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,615
We could have just died

1470
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
Possible they're all connected to the CIA

1471
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,367
Circle together this year

1472
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:38,207
What does parole hold most reasonable thing

1473
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,255
Somebody knows and we don't

1474
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
Just f******

1475
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
To me right now this is

1476
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,007
Seems like Chinese water torture where everyday there's just

1477
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
Just another little drip

1478
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
Another drip

1479
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:58,431
Like I just want them to blow up the world or leave you just wish that the Band-Aid

1480
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,223
Will get pulled off

1481
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:05,855
Nuclear war

1482
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,023
We're heading towards.

1483
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
Disclosure

1484
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,607
Reader

1485
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Anyway

1486
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
During this time

1487
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,959
In specific Alex Jones has that about Trump

1488
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Suggested it

1489
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
Is there outright said Trump will tell us about aliens

1490
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,383
What

1491
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
Wasn't the first

1492
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,711
Where is like

1493
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
The first thing I would ask is

1494
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:36,319
Where are the air

1495
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,207
Galaxy more interested in for very overt about you going to give us immortality

1496
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,303
I don't know about that Alex does want to live forever

1497
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
Speaking of Rogan

1498
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
It's time for a smile

1499
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,215
Strfkr reapportion at the show

1500
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,311
Alex's when going into overdrive

1501
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,103
In terms of bookings

1502
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
Who are

1503
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
Celebrity in nature

1504
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Anything's

1505
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
To distract he has some military faucon who carry in their commitment to

1506
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,695
It wasn't just because he

1507
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Is president

1508
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,743
Felt very weird

1509
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
He's had

1510
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
A string of Celebrity Guess

1511
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,399
Week he started the week

1512
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,471
Peggy had Eddie Bravo in

1513
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Studio

1514
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
Which

1515
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
And then also at the end of the week

1516
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
He had you've been teasing this for

1517
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
The entire week

1518
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,175
Jesse James

1519
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:39,807
Motorcycle impresario and former reality TV star

1520
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:40,831
Nazi

1521
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,047
I avoid celebrity everything

1522
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,071
As much as

1523
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
I can't believe it he's a Nazi

1524
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,703
But it doesn't look good

1525
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,751
He was wearing a Nazi hat

1526
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:05,151
Two fingers over his like top lip indicating sort of like a Hitler mustache

1527
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
That was released

1528
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,711
2014

1529
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:14,111
Which is just isn't that I think I do remember that one cuz the internet got

1530
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:20,511
We're going to be mean to him for a day until we ignore him again

1531
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
That proves anything

1532
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
Pictures all the time

1533
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,911
Especially Rich entitled

1534
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
Now here's my question

1535
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Covid-19

1536
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Let's number one

1537
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,079
Don't you have enough

1538
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Number two

1539
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:39,711
This is my other piece of evidence that I think Jesse James was a Nazi

1540
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,527
His business is called West Coast Choppers

1541
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,647
Okay and their original logo was very similar to the Nazi Iron Cross

1542
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,695
Almost identical

1543
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,767
He then

1544
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,071
A couple years later his logo

1545
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,887
It was basically

1546
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:04,543
It's just that bird

1547
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,359
Celery cause that new logo the warbird

1548
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
Which is like that

1549
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,271
It's not proof but man it doesn't look good

1550
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,807
Now

1551
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
It's a coincidence

1552
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
Another piece of cake

1553
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,951
A boy after he got divorced

1554
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
From Sandra Bullock

1555
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:27,327
He started messing around with this lady named Michelle Bombshell McGee

1556
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,655
Who is Abed of a Nazi

1557
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
Sandra Bullock

1558
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:34,751
Yeah that's crazy I don't know

1559
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:39,103
She divorced him and adopted African American babies

1560
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:49,343
I don't know so this lady Michelle McGee

1561
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,879
Right

1562
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
Has a tattoo

1563
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
On her her leg

1564
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,231
On the back of her

1565
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
WP

1566
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
Which is

1567
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
Notorious

1568
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Circles

1569
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
Has claimed

1570
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
I mean

1571
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:18,527
I go with either one of those she was quoted as saying Jesse and I had a conversation about it and he says he'll walk

1572
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,159
What are his friends have the tattoo

1573
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,303
A wet p**** World wipe

1574
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:34,911
Doesn't look good, like my friends have white power tattoos

1575
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Then

1576
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,775
Another piece of evidence that Michelle Bombshell McGee

1577
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,823
Maggie is a Nazi on Facebook

1578
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
She's listed

1579
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,639
Minecraft is her favorite book

1580
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,527
Mike

1581
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,831
Although that would be

1582
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:57,183
I feel like it's

1583
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,511
I've read not the entirety of mine, but I've read a bit of

1584
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,327
It's not for the literature

1585
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,863
It's not a well-written

1586
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:08,191
Yeah the only thing to take away from it is

1587
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:08,959
Hatred of the Jews

1588
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,263
Yeah that's really the only

1589
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
You know I've been

1590
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,848
In the past to read it

1591
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,432
And everytime I was like nah

1592
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,992
I don't think there's any reason

1593
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,832
Much like me going back and reading these globalist

1594
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,904
Life Is Life is

1595
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,232
Almost over now so glad

1596
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
Now that I know I only have 5 years left

1597
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
Husband said that she had child white power

1598
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Deez Nuts

1599
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
Then

1600
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
Jesse James a Nazi

1601
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,688
Was formerly married to

1602
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
To Janine London Mueller

1603
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,040
Who's who's on the cover of the Blink-182 album

1604
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,184
They're f****** dumbass title names

1605
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,464
Divorce

1606
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,304
And then she got remarried to a guy named Jeremy Aikman

1607
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,632
Who's a multiple-time felon and

1608
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
Yep

1609
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:17,824
Jeff angles

1610
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:23,712
Revoke Linden Mueller's custody of

1611
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,248
The child

1612
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
Janine had together

1613
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,880
Average 28 minutes evidence of negative environments for children

1614
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
That's a good

1615
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,304
All of these

1616
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,632
Look dead to rights

1617
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
Proven

1618
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
But if you're hanging around with that many enough

1619
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
Not good

1620
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:54,176
I don't think I don't think that necessarily Jesse James

1621
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
Is

1622
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
Himself

1623
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
An actual Nazi

1624
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,320
He's not not about because it is

1625
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
Not the 90

1626
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,160
He's not so he's not a reasonable person

1627
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:09,024
Because if I were around

1628
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
Become

1629
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
Very reasonable while being on Alex Jones

1630
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:19,008
The show and height comparison

1631
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:26,432
Seems like a kind of chill

1632
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,224
Comes up pretty decent to

1633
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:28,992
But like

1634
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
He he does do one thing

1635
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
Amazing

1636
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
That is he tells Alex repeat

1637
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,904
Deleted stop being a sore winner

1638
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Which I think is

1639
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Great

1640
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,792
And it really disrupt Alex Alex's got

1641
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,424
Since we've since we've been around

1642
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,984
Because he's Jesse James

1643
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,288
Inotorious real man

1644
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
A celebrity

1645
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,384
Al pastor kisses ass

1646
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
Right because he's a store

1647
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
So

1648
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,016
It really throws off the interview and

1649
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
By the time

1650
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
He does

1651
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
Tell Alex to stop being a sore winner

1652
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
It just bike

1653
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,648
Alex

1654
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,416
Get his bearings

1655
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,232
And he ends up just what kind of car

1656
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,632
Image of gestation in the first place

1657
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,192
B v narrative

1658
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
Show though

1659
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,592
Jesse James and then we will get to the real fun

1660
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
Which is

1661
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,920
The Adventures of Eddie Bravo

1662
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,968
But this one actually Jessie

1663
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
Isn't it

1664
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:33,760
It's just

1665
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,040
Alex Lyon

1666
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Real heart

1667
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,352
That didn't happen

1668
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,912
Reagan Metro

1669
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:56,032
Trump Poland trumped into younger

1670
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,616
There's a picture of them shaking hands

1671
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,920
I thought I was meeting the present

1672
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,992
Cuz he was such a powerful presence

1673
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,016
He never said

1674
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,296
No

1675
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,112
I did some research on it attracted

1676
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,160
Alex is quoting a meme

1677
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Oh

1678
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,024
Okay for you to say Alex was quoting Alex

1679
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,304
Cuz that seems very much

1680
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
His moves

1681
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,656
This before in the past like it is I think he keeps bringing up

1682
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,240
That is no basis in reality just showed up in a meme

1683
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,640
Except that it's true the same way 3 million undocumented immigrants

1684
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
Voted

1685
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,944
In the last election

1686
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,272
I love

1687
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
You just

1688
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,624
Proceed definitive evidence of someone

1689
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,672
Making s*** up not doing the research

1690
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
Not understanding what he's reading

1691
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,560
It would take a 20-second Google search

1692
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,096
Define the origin of that

1693
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,632
It's so easy

1694
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,472
The only thing that strange and we'd even surprise you is the Reagan

1695
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
Yeah like that is weird

1696
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
Because it's so weird and there's a

1697
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,568
Picture of it

1698
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,128
That's why

1699
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,224
So this clip is a little bit longer but I'm going to cut it off

1700
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,248
In the middle

1701
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,552
Instead

1702
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,344
Make the meme about when

1703
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,368
The clintons

1704
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
Hanging out with Trump

1705
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,976
It's like Hillary 20 years ago

1706
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
Methylpred

1707
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
Reagan's death

1708
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,656
Reagan is dead

1709
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,704
So you can lie in Contra but it

1710
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Well I mean

1711
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
In his later years

1712
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,528
He can walk

1713
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:46,368
I want to point this out last week Donald Trump

1714
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,136
Did tweet

1715
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,488
About how Russia has run over America and put run over in quote

1716
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
This is incredible

1717
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,816
Because that's Alex Jones Lang

1718
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,632
He talks about powerful people running over

1719
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
Weaker

1720
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,704
That's specifically

1721
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,984
Donald Trump

1722
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
Using Alex Jones Lang

1723
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,848
I mean it is it is in the popular consciousness

1724
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
I don't know

1725
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,528
I don't have to say it all the time

1726
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,928
So because Trump doesn't know where

1727
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,696
Costco

1728
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:25,280
Not at all

1729
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
Correctly at all

1730
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,680
He starts out

1731
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,472
This clip really dumb

1732
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,776
And then gets really aggressive about protest

1733
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,152
Russian Russian hacker Russia hack our election

1734
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:47,296
What

1735
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:52,928
Alex

1736
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:55,744
Fix that like the idea is that

1737
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,048
The Russian Hack memes that no one voted

1738
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:03,936
Stupid that's not what anybody thinks

1739
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,752
Million reasons

1740
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:13,408
Notably hate Hillary Clinton they have a documented history of him really not liking her

1741
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:19,808
And her being tough on them in terms of section

1742
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,600
Election I would if I could hack

1743
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
I probably would

1744
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:28,512
I know I'd leave a trail I wouldn't

1745
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:32,864
Did I stick of things I'm good at like three elephants from the land of Hyrule

1746
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:41,312
Russian robot

1747
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:47,712
I don't have anything really to come on here to talk to you about it's really.

1748
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,736
Special I think

1749
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,808
I like to come on here

1750
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:55,392
Just as a voice of The blue-collar Americans

1751
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,280
See James American worth a hundred million dollars

1752
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:07,680
Married to Sandra Bullock Award winner

1753
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,960
Nazi stripper

1754
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,008
Hey

1755
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,104
We can't yet prove that Sandra Bullock herself is not enough

1756
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:21,504
T-strap that's a fair point

1757
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,296
I don't want

1758
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
If we broke

1759
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
Sandra Bullock

1760
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
The Northeast

1761
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:35,840
Stripper Chicago

1762
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,864
Give us information

1763
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,144
Anyway

1764
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,680
Like I did

1765
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:43,264
I get what you saying about being blue collar

1766
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
He has these outward

1767
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,104
Appearing blue collar

1768
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,896
Hundred f****** million dollars

1769
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,688
Is probably worth way more than

1770
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,088
Really you know why he has all that money West Coast Choppers is incredibly successful

1771
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,880
It's a huge motorcycle

1772
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
And

1773
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
They don't really get into this on the show

1774
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,304
Has NRA branded shirt

1775
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,840
And clothing wear

1776
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
Like Target

1777
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
And stuff like that

1778
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,984
What do you make snow

1779
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:20,128
Billions of dollars selling NRA closed

1780
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,408
It was murder weapon

1781
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
I don't know

1782
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,736
Because they're Nazis

1783
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,344
Nazis really do know how to do their guns

1784
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,136
They also talked about these allegations

1785
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
Videos of Nazi

1786
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:36,256
At some point in his life

1787
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
Like everyone says all this ugly s***

1788
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,096
That's because there's ugly

1789
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,888
Yeah like if you didn't

1790
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
A Nazi stripper girlfriend

1791
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,032
We're banging around

1792
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,056
Stripper is

1793
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:53,664
Is a negative part of this at all

1794
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:57,248
Cut the stripper part that makes an interest

1795
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:03,648
I think the stripper and Nazi girlfriend still works

1796
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:07,488
And me being in the media narrative going from Sandra Bullock

1797
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,768
To a stripper is

1798
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
Compelling

1799
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:17,472
I agree we shouldn't Sandra Bullock

1800
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
She is

1801
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,288
Just interesting I feel

1802
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,592
I really could be a lateral move

1803
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,640
Our investigation

1804
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,016
And then like all these other connection

1805
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:33,600
Since the Nazis your iconography being Nazi An Origin like

1806
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,392
You can't be mad that

1807
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,416
People started drawing

1808
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:41,792
In the same way that like this whole thing that was Trump being investigated you can't be mad about that

1809
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,400
German last names

1810
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,752
And your grandfather has a lot of Nazi memorabilia

1811
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
If they're filling

1812
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:57,920
Maybe he's just really fascinated by WWII memorabilia or maybe

1813
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,736
And maybe it's worth looking into

1814
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,760
Exact

1815
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,808
The difference really matter

1816
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,648
Hitting your grandfather up on

1817
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,672
International Court

1818
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,464
Get him into a nerve

1819
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,536
Nuremberg trials

1820
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:19,168
People that think that you know because I'm filthy dirty everyday and because I work

1821
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,984
Mechanic

1822
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,520
They think I'm an idiot

1823
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:30,432
You think about the majority

1824
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,832
Modern history

1825
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,048
Build your own business

1826
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,848
Alex keeps trying to get promos on blah blah

1827
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,248
Put it in the

1828
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:10,880
He's very resistant to a to his credit

1829
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,464
He's getting he's getting to work and he's going about his business

1830
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,048
Why did you yell at everybody all the time Alex

1831
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,352
Think that he's an idiot

1832
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
No

1833
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:26,240
I mean I don't think he's a genius

1834
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,544
In the same in the same way and I know this

1835
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,664
Is a weird equivalents to make

1836
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:41,600
It's the same way where people think the Kardashians

1837
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,648
Tumi

1838
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,184
I mean maybe that's

1839
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
Maybe

1840
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,512
But also they turned

1841
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
Not

1842
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Being able to have

1843
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
Skills

1844
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,400
Into the most profitable skill you can have

1845
01:32:54,912 --> 01:33:01,056
They did make this whole weird Empire they're not they're not stupid or there

1846
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,688
A Machiavellian leader

1847
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,968
Like a mom

1848
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
Could be incredibly smart and everyone's going along for the ride I don't know point is

1849
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,696
You can't be an idiot

1850
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Create

1851
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,488
Something that huge

1852
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,512
I mean you can

1853
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,608
It's very okay

1854
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,376
Play an idiot

1855
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,936
So the fact that they present themselves as

1856
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,704
Is dumb

1857
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,776
Is kind of almost an indication that they're not that dumb

1858
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:36,896
I think you're getting a little bit too far down the rabbit hole

1859
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
George

1860
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
The w

1861
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,992
You know he could be

1862
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,296
This brilliant Mastermind

1863
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:46,368
A dumb idiot with a great

1864
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
Pedigree

1865
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,184
I think he's like Jesse James

1866
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,464
He's probably

1867
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,744
Diversion of The Middle

1868
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:57,120
You know like I think that the reason the George W bush seems dumb is because we're used to

1869
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Smart

1870
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,448
Well spoken

1871
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,984
Articulate

1872
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:07,360
What are the traits of a smart

1873
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,896
4 of a

1874
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
Right

1875
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,016
Positive traits

1876
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
He looked

1877
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:20,416
I looked dumb and comparison to our image of president but he wasn't that dumb

1878
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,232
No I I think

1879
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
Probably don't

1880
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:27,840
He looks dumb because

1881
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:30,656
Of images we have in our head

1882
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
He looks

1883
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
For so many reasons

1884
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,776
Not just images we have in our head

1885
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
He's not.

1886
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:53,952
Don't let him get to you

1887
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
A decade

1888
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:06,752
For the people

1889
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,080
That's not in the

1890
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,664
That's not an every single newspaper

1891
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,368
Because he is

1892
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,720
Thousands on thousands of Articles ethical Point red

1893
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,280
My argument doesn't

1894
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,608
He's just about assassination

1895
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:38,752
I'm sick of this crap

1896
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:45,152
I'm not pissed about those people I think it's funny I think it's funny that they ourselves up into a big dizzy

1897
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,176
Over

1898
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:53,344
Working Class People working

1899
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,672
He's working hard for them

1900
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,488
Hootie the Blowfish

1901
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:04,352
Yeah I was about to as about 2

1902
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,888
Lesbia sore winner

1903
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,192
There's nothing worse than a sore winner

1904
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:14,592
I'm just pointing out

1905
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,128
That's what these people do

1906
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,664
They like

1907
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
You know

1908
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,416
Never got to do the man we have the best

1909
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,976
Protection the best Elite and it's

1910
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
The same thing it's a trunk full of ping pong balls

1911
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
The only

1912
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:40,960
What's a metaphor

1913
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,568
That's not going to add anything to your car hurt your car

1914
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,592
It's just nothing

1915
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,384
It says that doesn't do anything

1916
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:51,456
People tweeting threats

1917
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:58,112
It's not great

1918
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,672
It makes sense to the point he's trying to make

1919
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,000
I like his perspective

1920
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
Doesn't like

1921
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,816
These are assholes

1922
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,400
People who are threatening to assassinate the president or saying he should die

1923
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,288
Shocking

1924
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,872
RN positions where they actually could

1925
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
Yeah

1926
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:23,968
I definitely wouldn't vocalize any of my inner thoughts

1927
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:29,344
Publix podcast

1928
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:33,952
Covid-19

1929
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,792
Mascot to a collision in the streets

1930
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:41,120
According to our laws

1931
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
I'm not saying I agree

1932
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
Play hang'em industry

1933
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
To the cons

1934
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,264
Institution

1935
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,056
And the laws we have

1936
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:53,920
It is well within our legal rights to hang

1937
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:57,504
Disagree but I also don't agree for safety sake

1938
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
Glitter coming out on Twitter

1939
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:06,208
And saying like they're only doing that to give themselves a little bit of Fame

1940
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,608
The little bit of like oh my God

1941
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,688
Its meaning

1942
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,736
It's it's

1943
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,808
It doesn't mean anything

1944
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
You know what I'm saying

1945
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,672
Hundred percent agree

1946
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:41,280
Are the false reality mean

1947
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:49,216
Duran Duran 18 hours

1948
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:52,800
Programming every day on all trumps

1949
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,080
Accomplishments

1950
01:38:54,336 --> 01:39:00,480
And everything he's done in the first 50 days and all that

1951
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,064
Twitter account

1952
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,856
Scream of Billy 218

1953
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:12,768
Investigative journalism

1954
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,816
I doubt that if you Google something it will appear

1955
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,352
But they got the number wrong

1956
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:19,168
He said Billy 328 Maple up to 18

1957
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
So that

1958
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:26,336
You know what I'm going to give them a path I think we're going to give him an a for effort there they do Google something good

1959
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,408
Time Forever

1960
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:36,832
But if they ran because it's not

1961
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:49,632
If you shut your phone off and your computer off so all that stuff

1962
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,104
So you just ignore all the trip

1963
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:02,688
I'd like to see I was hyper connected to it

1964
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,504
Before the election and now that we won

1965
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,088
I can sit back and like I know I have my friend

1966
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,928
Working in hot working his ass off in the White House

1967

People like me

1968
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:21,120
And people that think like me and I know it's the first time

1969
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
Find it really

1970
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,704
Cared about the little guy the guy game

1971
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,544
I totally agree that statement

1972
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,824
I don't know

1973
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,384
I don't have to worry about it anymore

1974
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,688
Interesting Jesse James

1975
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
Just stats

1976
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,528
You sounded like the most

1977
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,600
Brilliant person absolutely

1978
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,624
Is rambling

1979
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,392
Rage

1980
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
Like just

1981
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
Just

1982
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,512
Lexus coming out of his mouth

1983
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,792
Jesse James

1984
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:54,400
He sounds completely reasonable for the most part

1985
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,936
Dog whistle

1986
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:00,544
Like we don't have to worry about it

1987
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,824
Stuff

1988
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,360
There's there are

1989
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
We don't have

1990
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,456
To worry about something that rhymes

1991
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:13,344
Really long time

1992
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,136
It's not

1993
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
Woodrow Wilson

1994
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:23,328
Woodrow Wilson

1995
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,096
You're right

1996
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,912
There's no indication

1997
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
Like this

1998
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:30,496
It holds water at all that the president's haven't

1999
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,520
Cared about

2000
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,568
For people in the middle

2001
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,360
No investors

2002
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,152
There's like a lot of evidence that

2003
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,688
Well I mean maybe the last

2004
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,480
Cared about the poor in the middle class

2005
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,928
Carrot is a whole different story

2006
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,464
That's true

2007
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
He's an interesting

2008
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,768
In case study

2009
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,560
Okay

2010
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:59,680
Look up Billy 328

2011
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:03,264
Interesting

2012
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,104
Didn't take that long at all

2013
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,896
And they were all Twitter eggs

2014
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,920
Course

2015
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:12,992
And they were the same thing they have like

2016
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,808
No they don't follow anybody and they have

2017
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,368
3 followers Max

2018
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,672
It is it reminds me of that

2019
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,256
There was an article

2020
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
About how

2021
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,072
They're these Russians

2022
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:27,840
Twitter Bots

2023
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,376
Yeah even Russian

2024
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
That are lying dormant

2025
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Still kind of mixer

2026
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,288
Topix

2027
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
And put them into the Nash

2028
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,872
Consciousness

2029
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
And those

2030
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Works

2031
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,480
Suspicious in there

2032
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
Update

2033
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Just exist

2034
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:49,600
Nothing going on there super f***** up there's like

2035
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,928
Number but it was a it was a

2036
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:55,744
Chinle high percentage of Twitter's total accounts

2037
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,536
Cambridge analytica

2038
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
Video

2039
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:04,448
Which we don't want to talk about

2040
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,968
To get to our main man

2041
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,296
Again

2042
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:22,624
Seems like a really good hard dude

2043
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,160
Also seems very dumb

2044
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
But like he comes in

2045
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,232
I could not help but smile

2046
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,536
Sing Eddie Bravo in the Infowars Studio

2047
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:34,656
It's great you watch the show every day you're on Bravo

2048
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:38,240
The highwomen

2049
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,824
But it goes south really fast

2050
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,128
Let me start talking about

2051
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,992
Accidentally walks backwards

2052
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,552
And stumble straight into an addition of

2053
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:52,320
You're busted

2054
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,000
So there also exists starts by them talking about that Ted Gunderson

2055
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:00,768
Apparently

2056
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:01,792
FBI guy

2057
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,328
May or may not have been

2058
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,120
Ted Gunderson

2059
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:09,728
I would poison him. It's like out of the bad

2060
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,824
No I poisoned him because that name exists

2061
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,896
It's like that it's like a name you'd see in a script

2062
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,456
Where do I will come back on

2063
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,576
Poison poison three other people

2064
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,928
And he was in the FBI for 27 years he was in California

2065
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,976

01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,048
I am ahead of California

2067
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:40,704
Also I f****** love that like I'm not allowed to talk about this with a poison three more people

2068
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,032
Willie got a lot to talk about it's classified information

01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,640
David three more people just got poison

2070
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,920
But do you know what's crazy

2071
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
That's always

2072
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,736
Every

2073
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,272
This is a truth

2074
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,040
Statistic

2075
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:59,392

01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,304
Impossible not to

2079
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,912
For Alex to say things

2080
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Would be

2081
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,728
I can't get into the details

2082
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,496
But

2083
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
And then

2084
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,080
Say a generalized broad statement

2085
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,104
As opposed to

2086
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,432
I can't talk about this but I'm saying the exact same thing

2087
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:34,720
That's portfolios of Ted Gunderson former FBI chief

2088
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:37,536
Gigantic pedophile ring is going on

2089
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:43,936
A national origin International

2090
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:49,056
White supremacist

2091
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:52,640
Liquor store you got hit in the head with a gun you got to shoot somebody

2092
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,944
Those are rituals

2093
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,968
Yeah I'm your boss

2094
01:45:56,224 --> 01:46:00,064
Cheerleader

2095
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,136
From from The Godfather from

2096
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:09,280
Uno's movies all movies or whatever

2097
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:14,656
The Godfather Mario Puzo

2098
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:21,056
Mafia life at all

2099
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,336
So even

2100
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:26,688
Even Alex Jones is fake stores was also lying

2101
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,624
Three levels deep on lies

2102
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:38,208
Reporting it as reflecting reality is

2103
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,304
Nonesuch

2104
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:43,840
That's enough

2105
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,168
To show you feel somebody that got dirt on

2106
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
You got

2107
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:52,032
Took you got to hurt it

2108
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:54,848
That's going to be another contest

2109
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,248
And I'm not just talk about mollusca

2110
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,808
Pause levels

2111
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:10,976
Baby blue

2112
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,192
Build-A-Bear

2113
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,216
Machine

2114
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,008
Alex Jones

2115
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,800
Pacific engineering

2116
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,848
Requirements

2117
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,432
Someone's at the door

2118
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,968
You're busted

2119
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:36,064
What he's talking about there

2120
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,112
Came across

2121
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:39,392
Conspiracy blog

2122
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:44,512
The only way he could have ever come across this information

2123
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:48,864
Yes I'm first in order to get their adrenaline level

2124
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,656
You could just do that with

2125
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,448
I mean like

2126
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472
Time run

2127
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,616
You don't have to terrorize an abuser

2128
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
Like

2129
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:07,040
We're going to see who can run the fastest

2130
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
So

2131
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,624
Don't know more questions

2132
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,952
To some random ass pedophile

2133
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:17,280
Hypothetical Supply wrench

2134
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,560
Let's sit down

2135
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
Rework this whole plan

2136
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,888
On the conspiracy boards

2137
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:24,960
Narrative came up to explain pizzagate

2138
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:26,240
Andy's

2139
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,008
Organization

2140
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:31,104
Is the

2141
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,152
Then kill them and drink their blood

2142
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,944
Because the adrenaline

2143
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:37,248
Is it's called adrenochrome

2144
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
Will it been released in

2145
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:45,952
Made-up nonsense word is that it is a real thing adrenochrome adrenochrome

2146
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:52,608
Molecular formulas 989 no.3

2147
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,632
Paul Simon wrote a song about

2148
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:58,752
It's produced by the oxidation of adrenaline

2149
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,056
The derivatives and who cares

2150
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
Wacky and

2151
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,104
Information about

2152
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,152
Chemistry that we're not going to be able to

2153
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,224
Oxidization of adrenaline

2154
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,320
Perception by Elvis as a

2155
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,344
A product

2156
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,112
Decomposition of

2157
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
Produced many of the symptoms of

2158
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,256
Also author Hunter restaurant

2159
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,840
Mentions of his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

2160
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:27,168
Being also appears in the novel spill mat

2161
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,240
It's reference

2162
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,776
Fiction a bit

2163
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,824
Hallucinogen

2164
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,104
Liars

2165
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:41,760
Journalist

2166
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,040
He made shut up

2167
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:47,392
The first thing I want to point out is that this is there any evidence

2168
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,160
Done

2169
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
Adrenochrome

2170
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
I get to it

2171
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,488
The first

2172
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:58,656
Ibanez

2173
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:01,472
There are

2174
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,752
Pizzagate researchers

2175
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:03,776
Who just

2176
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,848
Throw whatever they can at the wall and see what sticks

2177
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:09,408
And one of the things that came out with was

2178
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
A completely unsubstantiated

2179
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:14,272
Unverified unsourced Theory

2180
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,552
About adrenochrome

2181
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,576
Being what

2182
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:19,136
The killing of the kids was all about

2183
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
It was because

2184
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:22,720
Adrenochrome if you've never done drugs

2185
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,000
You might think

2186
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
Did it creates

2187
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,584
Crazy hallucinogenic euphoric state

2188
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
And it sounds like it might

2189
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,192
Cuz if it's something that you could only get by drinking

2190
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,216
Can kids blood

2191
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,288
Then it seems like a great High

2192
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,080
Really good now has a couple problem

2193
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,616
Otherwise you can just like

2194
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,152
Coke

2195
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:44,736
Sure illegal

2196
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:50,624
Still illegal like you could just do what you don't even have to do a pedophile ring

2197
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,024
Anthony wearing your bone

2198
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,608
Theories are widely discredited

2199
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:04,960
I can't imagine how people in the pizzagate world

2200
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:08,544
Don't look at this as a salad

2201
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,360
First

2202
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
Because it is

2203
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,272
I love

2204
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,296
That you hate that

2205
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:22,112
Name for the segment so that's why I'm going to keep it a lot

2206
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:28,512
When Alex was talking about pizzagate on The Joe Rogan show he brought up like vampirism

2207
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:34,912
And stuff like that

2208
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:37,216
Literal vampire vampire

2209
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,312
These guys are drinking adrenochrome

2210
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,896
Through the Wire

2211
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:50,528
I don't think that there is a machine that allows you to

2212
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
Alright so

2213
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,320
You got

2214
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,344
You got the kid

2215
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,136
Terrorized

2216
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:56,928
He's alright

2217
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,000
Haha you put them on the machine what it what are we

2218
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:03,840
If we're going to entertain this Siri what kind of Machinery talking about

2219
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,888
Is it going to look like an MRI machine

2220
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:08,704
I'm picturing you being like that the

2221
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,240
Clockwork Orange

2222
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:13,824
OKC I saw it like the Spanish Inquisition

2223
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,640
Back right

2224
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:25,344
It creates more surface area

2225
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,136
Eliza

2226
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,024
And then you

2227
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,328
Slowly drained

2228
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
Blood

2229
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:40,192
You probably would have to do is ask

2230
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:45,824
So now you got all what you would not have gotten unless the kid were terrified

2231
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,360
That makes sense

2232
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:51,200
You could just go in and get their f****** adrenal glands

2233
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,736
You got to get it from the blood

2234
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,296
Or take an Epi shot

2235
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:58,112
Or just watch the movie Pulp Fiction

2236
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:01,184
They have adrenaline and here's the deal

2237
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,512
They made it up in the truck

2238
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,560
Adrenaline can be synthesized

2239
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,328
Otherwise

2240
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,096
Is then

2241
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:11,936
Exact same chemical compound

2242
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
In different ways

2243
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,032
Much cheaper do donuts kill kids

2244
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:21,408
So we're reducing the number of children

2245
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,736
Jim Kelly

2246
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,040
There is a lot of websites

2247
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,320
Where people do trip reports

2248
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:32,416
Where they take substances and then they report back on what the experience

2249
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:33,952
Thank God for the

2250
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:37,792
Sure

2251
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,376
Are universally

2252
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,192
This is not a good Buzz

2253
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,520
Not that it's a bad but if you didn't know that

2254
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,592
The effects are so mild

2255
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,128
Do you not

2256
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,408
Really even know that you're

2257
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,712
You wouldn't know that you take

2258
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Substance

2259
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
You couldn't be dosed with

2260
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
So

2261
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,368
So

2262
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,648
It's it

2263
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,696
So there's really no

2264
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:09,024
If you don't if you couldn't know there was a high if

2265
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,048
You didn't

2266
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:14,144
No you are high

2267
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,704
Junior highers smoking

2268
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,752
Oregano

2269
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:24,896
Basically yeah there's a psychosomatic High to it

2270
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:30,784
I looked at was taking a low dose

2271
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,808
You know maybe that's

2272
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:36,416
Maybe he only took a quarter of a kid when you need to take

2273
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,184
You need to take

2274
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:43,584
You know it's like with Edibles to make sure you get the dosage right and everyone is different

2275
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,824
He's a really hard to scare

2276
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
Next

2277
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,408
Going to really cut into your time

2278
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,224
You don't want to get one of these brakes

2279
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,760
Get a bad Buzz

2280
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,320
So

2281
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:09,952
That you want to get a Really Brave kid cuz that a video game is drinks out of my computer crashed and I lost

2282
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:15,328
The the word document that I had that had all these calculations but I'll redo it

2283
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,656
I've just going to be a little bit vague with the numbers

2284
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,424
Specific

2285
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:22,496
I found the amount of

2286
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,800
Adrenochrome your body can produce

2287
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,384
You're at your maximum level that didn't

2288
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
You can't just

2289
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:31,200
Create

2290
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,224
Child

2291
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,576
10 year old as sort of a myth

2292
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,344
A midline

2293
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,160
The amount that a 10 year old child

2294
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:42,464
Create in their body

2295
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
Is

2296
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,816
Like the equivalent of nothing

2297
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,120
Basically

2298
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,912
All of his blood

2299
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:53,216
I meant take me to drive to crawl out of it

2300
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
You would need

2301
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,288
To kill I think

2302
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,336
300 kids

2303
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,128
In order to get enough

2304
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,432
For that bad Buzz

2305
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,712
Did that guy on the trip

2306
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:06,528
No wonder they needed an entire

2307
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,576
Pizza restaurants

2308
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,672
You got to get

2309
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:17,024
They needed at least two or three Chuck-E-Cheeses operating at the same time in Oregon

2310
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:19,072
Can we just stop it

2311
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:25,472
Think for just one moment how's the real this entire f****** conversation is right now

2312
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:29,568
Thought I would get to a point where somebody told me exactly how much a

2313
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:33,664
Adrenochrome

2314
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:40,064
The weirdest f****** thing and this is how crazy the times are right now I was lifting

2315
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,624
Like 10 minutes

2316
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,928
Let's see how this goes

2317
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,952
We living in a

2318
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:48,256
Same world where that's the least crazy

2319
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:53,632
Crazy thing I've heard today so that's why it's important that we Embrace this craziness and just like

2320
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,728
Follow you down the rabbit hole what how much

2321
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,496
Blood

2322
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,824
Easy to get really horrified and shocked because

2323
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,384
If children is a real thing

2324
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,432
It's horrible

2325
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,736
To be like

2326
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,016
This is awful

2327
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,880
Looking at

2328
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,952
The perspective that I'm coming from

2329
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:18,720
Is

2330
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:19,744
They're not drinking

2331
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:24,096
Visiting app

2332
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:35,616
And all these blogs for pitching this as a rationalization

2333
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,920
10-4 it's like no one

2334
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,504
Ditl

2335
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,040
The very idea

2336
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,064
The in order to

2337
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,600
To get a week

2338
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:47,392
Mild bad Buzz

2339
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,952
You need to kill 300 kid

2340
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,232
Make this

2341
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,000
This

2342
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,536
Stupidest f****** thing

2343
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,304
In the world

2344
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:56,864
Alright

2345
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:57,888
Globalist

2346
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,936
Have been around according to Alex

2347
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:00,704
400

2348
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,544
They have evolved

2349
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:05,568
Separately from

2350
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
The human race

2351
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,664
In order to process adrenochrome

2352
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,432
Arab mud

2353
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,968
Efficient

2354
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:12,736
Rate

2355
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:15,296
Sure

2356
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:24,256
Okay great okay

2357
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,560
Your body

2358
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,680
Is there

2359
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,448
Found

2360
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,728
Science

2361
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:39,872
If you're speculating had an alien race I think so

2362
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,224
He really does believe that

2363
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:49,088
And the idea of it being a metaphorical psychic vampire

2364
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:55,488
Thing he can't he can't fall back on that would be to drink

2365
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:58,560
Contained in one person let alone 300

2366
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,328
And no

2367
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:05,728
I can't imagine that that's not a thing I can imagine cuz I don't even know I don't want

2368
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
Did you drink a glass

2369
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,616
Ipecac type quality

2370
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:12,896
If you end up throwing up

2371
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,200
The very least it would bum me out real heart

2372
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:17,504
Yep so that is

2373
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,272
Uno

2374
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:22,624
Great and Brazeau was able to pull that out of him I really appreciate that

2375
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:25,696
Bravo

2376
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,488
Realized

2377
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,792
How stupid would Alex Wassabi

2378
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,072
Cuz he doesn't call him out

2379
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:34,144
Realizes how stupid what

2380
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:37,216
Yeah

2381
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Eddie

2382
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:38,752
Is going to be a

2383
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,800
Hero

2384
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:46,432
I love Eddie Bravo as The Accidental Hero of every one of these people

2385
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:49,248
Anytime Eddie Bravo shows up he's like

2386
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,784
He's like mr. Magoo

2387
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,344
Eddie Bravo is to be like he's blind

2388
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,368
I'm stumbling around and just

2389
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:59,488
Just makes it through just fine also a little known fact

2390
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,888
We're not allowed to give you this on Facebook

2391
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:08,704
Nazi stripper it's dead you pulled the right you got

2392
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,984
Ultima Google

2393
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:10,752
I got bus

2394
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:15,872
We're not allowed to give you this on Facebook

2395
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,944
Chop

2396
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:22,272
No because cuz we told you 12 years ago they

2397
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,576
Watching

2398
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,624
It's because we're on target

2399
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:32,512
He had a couple things on Facebook

2400
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:35,328
I'm not sure

2401
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:39,424
Details of it could be a false flag things getting erased like he did it to himself

2402
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,448
I don't know

2403
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,728
But

2404
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:47,616
He's using it as like a really harsh example of censorship

2405
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:49,152
I have the details emerge

2406
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,736
You know as is

2407
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,016
V

2408
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,440
Of what he say

2409
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,256
They're saying

2410
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:06,560
That they're censoring us because we're Liars end

2411
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:08,864
Fake truth is there's no

2412
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,216
Now you get back to how we talk to Trump

2413
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:17,568
Isn't the president United States is called regular people

2414
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:21,920
Nobody takes

2415
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,992
To get back to this

2416
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,272
He f******

2417
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,552
Loses

2418
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:29,344
His train of thought so hard

2419
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,608
Why couldn't you just asset the heads of state

2420
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,776
That's ridiculous

2421
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:48,544
Don't

2422
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:49,568
Want

2423
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:50,848
To review

2424
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,872
Something

2425
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,152
I guess

2426
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:53,920
I don't know

2427
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,944
It's ridiculous

2428
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,480
It's absolutely ridiculous

2429
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:58,016
Not as ridiculous as next clip

2430
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,296
Where

2431
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,576
Eddie Bravo

2432
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
Bravo

2433
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,440
What are you doing

2434
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,464
That's on your cycle

2435
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,096
Are we late

2436
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,912
Alex wants

2437
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:17,728
To talk about something and Eddie brings up a topic

2438
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:18,752
The clearly Alex

2439
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,848
That's a family that have been in

2440
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:28,224
And whatever heard was

2441
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,576
Drugs that kill people you don't want to join

2442
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
But

2443
02:02:46,656 --> 02:02:48,448
A Delta Force years ago

2444
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,008
They would come in and order them listen info

2445
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:56,896
I'm saying

2446
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:01,248
Confirm

2447
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,672
And and and that's just a fact

2448
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:26,592
Pizza Patron

2449
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:30,432
Ociaa

2450
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,992
Overthrow government

2451
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:36,064
He said all the next month are going to release you tomorrow the CIA to

2452
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,368
Discipline

2453
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,648
He's talking about Steve

2454
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:43,744
Pieczenik I brought up earlier you do the guy who comes on Alex's show

2455
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:45,792
Some put some regularity

2456
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:48,608
Wasn't

2457
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,912
Director of the CIA

2458
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:53,472
He was the technical hat

2459
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:57,824
Steve pieczenik was a psychologist psychiatrist Within

2460
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,384
He's also

2461
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
Source of the

2462
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,456
Counter-coup narrative

2463
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:06,784
About how Rogue CIA agents

2464
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,576
Running is silent

2465
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,856
Peaceful

2466
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:11,392
Against Hillary Clinton

2467
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,672
And then

2468
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:15,232
Now they're trying to run the counter

2469
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:19,328
Yes got that information

2470
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,096
Steve pieczenik

2471
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
This is where are you

2472
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,680
Is about to show some

2473
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:24,704
Real Valley

2474
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:27,520
Early settlement

2475
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:31,360
Dr. Steve pieczenik totally legit right

2476
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:35,712
Italian newspapers

2477
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,536
On your show

2478
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:50,816
Stead

2479
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,608
No

2480
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:59,008
Kids died at Sandy Hook it was a Homeland Security drill that they passed on

2481
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:08,480
Bravo at 8

2482
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:12,064
The thing is that if anybody else were to bring this up

2483
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,088
Alex

2484
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:15,136
Because he's a strfkr

2485
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:15,904
He is like

2486
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:21,536
The other

2487
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,072
Yes you can

2488
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,008
Yelp

2489
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,336
But that's that that's the most

2490
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:37,152
Cowardly a conspiracy theorist argument

2491
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,176
Where the other

2492
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:48,416
Anderson Cooper

2493
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:51,232
What are the Worcester

2494
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,584
Well let me let me

2495
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,400
He's talking about recovering

2496
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,680
Sandy Hook stop

2497
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:02,240
And it does appear that his

2498
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,312
But

2499
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:07,872
Their theory is that it's green screen

2500
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,432
Reduce the news

2501
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:12,480
Because his nose is green

2502
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:17,088
I don't know I've done

2503
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,368
Some looking into it

2504
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,904
Defined

2505
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,440
Arguments for why

2506
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:25,024
Anythink

2507
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,792
Media space

2508
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:26,560
Everything is fake

2509
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:29,376
I work

2510
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:31,168
Video production

2511
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,960
And that could just be

2512
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:36,544
It's called like a p frame rate

2513
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:39,104
Little technical glitches that

2514
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,712
It's not evidence

2515
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,736
A blue screen

2516
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,272
I got so

2517
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,832
Stupid and you should not use that as evidence

2518
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:50,368
The kids weren't killed at Sandy Hook

2519
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,416
Very lame

2520
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,720
You can't you can prove it

2521
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,744
When were the other

2522
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,048
There's one way to prove it

2523
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,608
And listening to people's stories

2524
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:01,632
Boat

2525
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,656
Jesus f******

2526
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:09,568
Question about Sandra questions why weren't the

2527
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:11,872
Medevac helicopter call

2528
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,408
Operation

2529
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,944
Paw Patrol

2530
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:22,880
That's not what we're not at all answering just completely cuz he doesn't want to talk about

2531
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:25,440
Country rock

2532
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:28,512
And he even though

2533
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,120
Now he's got a back down on

2534
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:37,216
So many other little things

2535
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:40,800
He's a better strategist that are f****** president

2536
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,336
Because that's the same thing that

2537
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,360
Happened with Flynn

2538
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,384
They got one

2539
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,664
Now they're going to go after me

2540
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,480
Blood and water

2541
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:51,296
Me to to just avoid instead of

2542
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,320
Admit that he's wrong

2543
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,344
Anything

2544
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:56,928
Then he can keep on going and what are the things that super interesting

2545
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:58,720
Keep track of and watch is the

2546
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,000
The times that I exchanged

2547
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:00,768
Subject

2548
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,816
Like that

2549
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,608
There is not like

2550
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,912
Oh I just realized it Steve pieczenik

2551
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,448
Helped overthrow

2552
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,544
Right he wants to get off this topic as quickly as possible

2553
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,080
And not draw attention

2554
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,896
Right

2555
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,688
Of course not

2556
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:24,576
Intero Tom Clancy's books

2557
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:32,768
Here's a big secret by the CIA

2558
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:36,352
Man there like for Special Forces

2559
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:41,728
Are there Army Navy Marine Corps

2560
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,008
Animation Squad

2561
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,080
Locations around the country

2562
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:47,872
Sleeper Cell

2563
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:55,040
And so that's basically what goes on but do they really have a assassins are doctors

2564
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:03,488
The Navy or the army

2565
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
Cars

2566
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,280
We're back to Batman

2567
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:08,608
Yeah we're back

2568
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,376
You get

2569
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:15,776
L.ron Hubbard

2570
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:17,312
What is goddamn happen

2571
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:20,384
What kind of

2572
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,152
What

2573
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,944
Dr. Fortune

2574
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:29,088
Is the basis for Jack Ryan in covert action

2575
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:34,720
Any possibility we don't have time to unpack

2576
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,280
It's such a side issue

2577
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:39,328
He's that good I'm already

2578
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:41,888
Forgetting about Sandy Hook

2579
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,424
Anyway

2580
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,448
Snitching a little bit

2581
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:50,592
He's telling tales about the CIA

2582
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,920
They have overthrown at least seven or eight

2583
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:02,368
Before we get out of here I'm just going to talk about one of them

2584
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:03,904
Play the last one

2585
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:06,976
Set up with

2586
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
It's f****** Pope

2587
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:13,632
Because he claims that the pope said muslim terrorism.

2588
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,400
Exist

2589
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:19,520
He goes back to this a lot and I've actually pulled up the the speech that that's from

2590
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:22,336
Actually really great

2591
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,616
It's actually beautiful

2592
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,896
Full sentimental the pope was make

2593
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,200
Here's a quote

2594
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
The Pope

2595
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,248
The other

2596
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:36,160
Reflection that I shared it on most recent World meeting a popular movement

2597
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,464
I feel it is important to say again

2598
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,256
No people is Criminal

2599
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,280
And no religion

2600
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,048
Terrorist

2601
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,840
Christian terrorism does not exist

2602
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:45,632
Jewish terrorism does not exist

2603
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,424
Terrorism

2604
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:48,448
They do not exist

2605
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:51,264
No people is criminal or drug trafficking

2606
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,032
Or violence

2607
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:54,592
He was actually saying that the identification

2608
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:03,552
Smart for him to say because then he never has to deal with

2609
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,576
Ireland

2610
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,856
He goes on to say

2611
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,904
The grave danger is to disown our neighbor

2612
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:12,000
When we do so we deny their humanity and our own Humanity without realize

2613
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:13,536
We deny ourselves

2614
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:15,072
And we deny the most important

2615
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,096
Commandments of Jesus

2616
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:17,632
Herein lies the danger

2617
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:18,912
The dehumanization

2618
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:20,960
But here we also find an opportunity

2619
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:25,568
That the light of the love of neighbor May illuminate the Earth with its stunning brightness

2620
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:26,336
Like a light

2621
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:27,360
V in the dark

2622
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:31,456
It may wake us up and let true Humanity burst through with authentic resistance

2623
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,224
Resilience

2624
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,552
Beautiful

2625
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:40,160
Claiming that there isn't

2626
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:43,232
There aren't people who are Muslims who do terrorism

2627
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,512
That's not the point

2628
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,096
Anyway here's the last clip

2629
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,376
This is Bravo

2630
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,656
Tell you that

2631
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:51,680
Okay

2632
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:54,496
Along with Eddy's in-studio appearance

2633
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,544
They also posted

2634
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,592
Hour long video

2635
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,128
Of him at dinner

2636
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,408
With Owen Shroyer

2637
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,712
Annie and Owen Shroyer

2638
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
At dinner

2639
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:08,064
Do that for an hour

2640
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:12,160
It's just crazy but let's go

2641
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:17,024
Because you're too humble

2642
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:23,424
Go do an hour interview airplane with one of the great reporters ha so we can actually hear any Bravo on shame

2643
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,216
Eddie Bravo

2644
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:25,984
Does what they want

2645
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:26,752
And so they do

2646
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:27,776
They go to dinner

2647
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:32,640
I was going to make a Supercut of all of the stupid s*** that they talk about

2648
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:33,408
But I couldn't

2649
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,480
They talk about Flat Earth

2650
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,040
There's a nice wall

2651
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,320
That's

2652
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:44,928
There's something on the other side of this

2653
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,488
He know what it is

2654
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:55,936
And we take it over there

2655
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,216
Because I have to come over here

2656
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,752
F****** retarded

2657
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:00,288
I apologize

2658
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,616
Also he says that nuclear weapons aren't real

2659
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,552
Dinosaurs are fake

2660
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:12,576
Did you know

2661
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:15,136
The every dinosaur bone at museums

2662
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:22,816
That doesn't mean they're all replicas

2663
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:29,472
I wanted to make a Supercut

2664
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,240
Hear that

2665
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:32,032
Stupid blogs

2666
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
I'm sure

2667
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,336
Anyway

2668
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:36,128
This clip that I did pull

2669
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:37,152
Really something

2670
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,248
What does underlie all

2671
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:06,848
Research

2672
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:10,944
Cuz I didn't look into it

2673
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:12,224
Yeah so

2674
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:16,576
They're well done Eddie

2675
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:21,184
The entire Alex Jones

2676
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:28,608
Still well you said it

2677
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:30,400
Look into intellectually offenses

2678
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984
Just told f******

2679
02:14:35,264 --> 02:14:36,032
The guy who doesn't

2680
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:36,800
Try

2681
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:38,592
Because

2682
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:39,872
If you fail

2683
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:42,432
And you don't try you just know I didn't try

2684
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:44,736
Imogene

2685
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,112
My college career

2686
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,392
30 problems like

2687
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,184
It's probably true

2688
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,488
I didn't look into it

2689
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:58,816
All you do is take away any like

2690
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:02,144
Semblance of State personal responsibility whatsoever

2691
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:07,264
Through Alex Jones

2692
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,568
Little bit

2693
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:10,592
Episode

2694
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:12,640
Soon I think

2695
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:14,432
Maybe more into

2696
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,552
What we do next time ladies and gentlemen

2697
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:22,880

Which will say do you like us

2706
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,224
Yes or no

2707
02:15:50,016 --> 02:15:53,088
Also no interest in these shirts

2708
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,184
I think if the interest is implied

2709
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,936
If you want

2710
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:10,752

2711
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,384
