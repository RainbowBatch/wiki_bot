1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

4
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

5
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Exit

6
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
Call Bruce lean.

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
A little bit about

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Remember to do an intro

9
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Hi

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,272
Your intro

11
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
When you're by yourself

12
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Have a tendency to flounder

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
A little heavy

14
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
Start to go a little bit off the rails it's

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,680
Kind of Wylie Coyote

16
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
You don't know when you run off the

17
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
You keep going

18
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
It's kind of amazing

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
Existential question in the middle of why am I doing

20
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
There is that

21
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
Anyway I'm you fall you hold up a sign that says

22
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
So I'm glad that we are remembered

23
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
To do that

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,232
What about you

25
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
They seem trivial but

26
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
It is the park

27
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
I can spot that I got

28
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
Today there is so on the street

29
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Alright

30
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
1

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Spot

32
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
1

33
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
That is free

34
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
There's no there's no parking

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
M

36
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
It is in between

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Don't talk to me man can't you can't

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
Park in those places

39
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
But there's one

40
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Perfect spot

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Completely free

42
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Right

43
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Always felt

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
But then every now and again

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
This is the second

46
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
Time in like 3 years I've gotten this spot

47
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,400
Brighten your day man free parking

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
Fantastic more work to do cuz I'm going to have to

49
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
To bleep a couple things

50
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,920
Specific enough to go locate me with us on time I'm still uncomfortable with landmarks

51
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,016
As far as parking goes that could be anywhere in the city

52
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,808
It's a it's a real Menace

53
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,344
People have a real tough time with

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Glad to I'm glad you landed

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
It's a little bit like standing in the four corners you know where you're like oh I'm in any state that I want to be right now or you

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Like this is the freest Park

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,168
Working at the entire block uptown

58
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
That was the worst

59
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
Cuz I

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Text my old place

61
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
I lived on Ainsley

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
An extra

63
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
Is so

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Thin

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
And

66
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
There's people Park parking

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Both sides of the street

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
I got to do there's never a

69
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
It was just

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
So awful

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Anytime anybody

72
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
He came over

73
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
There was just like

74
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
Think they would learn

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
They're like oh I have to park

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
A ways away or drive around in a loop

77
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
For half an hour

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
To find someone leaving now

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Anybody living near Belmont

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
Lakeshore is like

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
But you might as well Park on Addis

82
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,152
This is my man funny story that was around where I lived before

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
But yeah

00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Yeah a lot of people

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Who who

Come over with

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320

Yeah luckily for us you also live in uptown when I was in uptown

91
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
It was a pretty convenient

92
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Beautiful

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,703
We have view to enjoy

94
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,799
Continuing our Sneaky Snake weekend series

95
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,895
We have a little conversation with Williamson

96
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Dropped

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
Good friend Elizabeth yeah

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
The trial has a

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
Concluded until we thought the invitation

100
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Did you check in with the legal end

101
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Mark

102
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,999

103
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
The entire time

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,655
Therefore the trial

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
The lawyers in the jury I think Elizabeth has been in there

106
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
The most

107
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Professional capacity

108
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Part of the trial

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759

Ben Eminem song is

Every time Dad

I'm used to not being

140
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Anything that is okay

141
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
How are you

142
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
I am fine how are you guys

143
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
A little tired a little exhausted

144
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,719
I'm sure you're feeling fairly similarly so

145
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,119
I should I am actually but I'm um I'm happy even though you didn't ask me what's my brightest

146
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
But my bright spot is that I'm in Wisconsin at my brother's house

147
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
I think a little people's Brightspot involves what

148
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Wisconsin

149
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
People who love cheese

150
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Who's there

151
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Sure

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Fall colors

153
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Milwaukee's in Wisconsin

154
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
That's true they have vents

155
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,879
Spotted Cow is that the name of the beer that Everyone likes

156

00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,911
Okay well that was it Alex Jones is going to lose nine hundred million dollars

159
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007

Ropes you in

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
Spotted Cow

162
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
That's right

163
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
I'm thinking it's probably a little early for it but

164
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Never know

165
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
It's it's

166
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
Creamy right I mean it has notify cream

167
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
Buy things

168
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Afford a

169
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
I applied there we are we easing into day drinking that early

170
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
Beer

171
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,679
I'm so you I got to imagine are exhausted because

172
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
You've been

173
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
In Connecticut

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
For the trial

175
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
The entire time right

176
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
It was almost

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
5 weeks

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Excessive

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Of that

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Yeah I did go home on the weekend

181
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
But

182
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Yeah I

183
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,903
Was there for the whole thing and I wouldn't have been anywhere else

184
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
Because it was really

185
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
Quite something

186
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Yeah

187
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Yeah dude

188
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
I guess that's got to help

189
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
I mean being able to go home on the weekend

190
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
Probably keeps a little bit of Sanity but

191
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
That's being done in Texas

192
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Next two weeks was

193
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
It felt like an endurance

194
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Trial

195
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
And this

196
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
Trial in particular was

197
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
There's so many really moving

198
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
Difficult stories from these family members

199
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
I just

200
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
I feel like

201
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
I feel like I would

202
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Collapse

203
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Yeah

204
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,279
Yeah I mean that the families were the ones I really was thinking out because

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
Yeah once in awhile the group would be larger or smaller but I would say for the most

206
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Start

207
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
The families attended just about every day of the trial and

208
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,223
You could really see the toll that it was taking on them I mean there were some family members that

209
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,063
You know every time their child's name for example was mentioned

210
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:33,695
In court date you know they were job she's very emotional about that and

211
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
And then hearing each other stories I mean they

212
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
Sometimes there were spouses

213
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
It's who you know

214
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
They didn't know that

215
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
What the other one had gone through you know they didn't they hadn't heard that exact story told him that exact way or

216
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
They hadn't heard you know

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Another relative story

218
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Themselves

219
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
So

220
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
You know you could really see

221
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Your how much

222
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:09,023
What a revelation some of this was even to them

223
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
And and they were really there for each other I mean

224
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
LSAT together they all consult

225
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
Each other they all kind of

226
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
No

227
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Spend time together and that was really something

228
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,151
Yeah that is a really really interesting thing that I

229
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,039
I hadn't thought of it I imagine most people had thought of because you know despite our our

230
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,439
I desire to kind of you everybody individually in this case obviously there is still that element of

231
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
They're all sitting there with a shared

232
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
Events in their lives so you just kind of don't realize that

233
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Course they wouldn't have

234
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
Just sat down in a group and gone through each individual story to each other and if you have

235
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Even if you're a

236
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,687
Married to somebody or maybe maybe you're divorced or whatever but I'll partner

237
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
Sometimes in the aftermath of would like a really terrible grief

238
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
Don't want to relive it

239
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,999
Yeah or even overburden the other balls elderly strong for them not

240
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
Maybe some of the

241
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
The intricacies of what you

242
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Through

243
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
Really come up

244
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
A number of them spoke about

245
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
How they tried to Shield

246
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
The other parent for example

247
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
From what they were hearing or what they were seeing or the attacks that were you no coming at them

248
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
I've noticed

249
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,367
Yeah and then the other thing and I noticed this when I was writing my book

250
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,487
Memories are faulty particularly when people have gone through

251
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Update,

252
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
They they

253
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
You can't remember

254
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
You know just about a decade so

255
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Yeah I think

256
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
Them working on those Recollections and and then reclaim them

257
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
Yeah there were things that I think they met some people in the room had

258
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
No I really remembered although they may have noted at the

259
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Do blockout

260
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Abet

261
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
The brain will create that safety measures much

262
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Protect

263
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Your partner

264
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
Protect you

265
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Yeah yeah I know it's really true

266
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
Until we came to the end of the trial last week

267
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
On Wednesday

268
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
I guess the verdict was read on Wednesday

269
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
The actual end of the the argument

270
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Was

271
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
The week

272
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
The end of the week prior

273
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
What is the eggs that I was wondering

274
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Was

275
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
How

276
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Did things feel as time went on

277
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
And the jury was deliberating

278
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Yes

279
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
Number of questions until every time they'd ask a

280
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
You try to game no

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:58,751
Does that mean you don't want to hear the testimony again of William Sherlock

282
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Who's

283
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
Wife Mary Sherlock was the school psychologist

284
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Died at Sandy Hook

285
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
And I

286
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
There was this

287
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Nino

288
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Thought in the room well

289
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Okay let's think

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
His name appears

291
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
On the bottom of the jury

292
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
So does that mean they're nearing the end

293
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Alright

294
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
You know figure it all out

295
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
And kind of game through it to SeaWorld and one question in particular

296
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Jerry asked

297
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Was

298
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
This thing where they said

299
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,735
What does it mean there's this kind of archaic language in the law

300
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,319
In these sorts of cases and it's

301
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
What does it

302
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
The instructions of the jury is

303
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Try to put

304
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
The plaintiff

305
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,559
Back into the position when you know Levi these damages

306
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
Try to put them back into the position they were before the harm occurred

307
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
And you know that works

308
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
For things like

309
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
A broken contract

310
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
So you know you can say well here's the income you would have had

311
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
That person hadn't broken the illegally broken

312
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
The contract or

313
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,831
You know a personal injury you know you're paying for hospitalization and maybe special

314
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
Pear and things like that

315
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,183
But when it comes to defamation and

316
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
You know reputational damage and things like that

317
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
Reputational damage to someone who has lost

318
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Someone in this way

319
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
How do you ever get them back

320
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
To where they

321
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Stop it

322
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
That's what becomes almost a philosophical question

323
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
So

324
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
Yeah it's a

325
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
Oh it was just

326
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
You everyone was thinking

327
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,807
What happens when they're asking that question are they thinking

328
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
You know

329
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
No amount of money by the thinking

330
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Any amount of money

331
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Yeah how

332
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
How are they grappling with that

333
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
So

334
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,423
So that was kind of the thing he everybody was wondering you know what why do they know

335
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
What's going on inside that room where

336
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
Only the six-member panel is meeting

337
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
Yeah I remember the one question that

338
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,199
Stuck with me from them is the one where they asked why was the why was Lafferty the first

339
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
First name

340
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Obviously it was just

341
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
That was the first name and then at all men

342
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
Rather than right-handed real name right

343
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
Everybody everybody went

344
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Oh I know

345
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
They must be thinking that

346
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:35,167
If the name is first maybe there was more injury to them you know everybody had to have had that same thought right

347
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
Well Isles I had another take away from it and that was

348
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,823
Boy does this show they are not Googling anything

349
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,735
They're sticking to the judge's instructions if they're asking this

350
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
Yep not even the definition of at all

351
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Yeah

352
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
No they were

353
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Very thorough

354
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
They they were

355
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
Extremely diligent you got the

356
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Presents that

357
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
You

358
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:09,215
As the judge was noting during the trial they were showing up early every day they were taking notes I mean they were

359
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
They were really into this

360
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
And and yeah they were

361
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,663
Very engaged and I noticed a lot

362
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
You know there would be

363
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
Different testimony and you know you they would be

364
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
You're wiping

365
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,391
Their tears away so kind of crying a little bit

366
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,255
Kind of when Jones testified you know a lot of frowns and a lot of shaking of

367
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
There has

368
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Send

369
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
That you know was really into

370
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Interesting because

371
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,311
After that Norm Patterson told me he thought Jones did well in his testimony and I was thinking

372
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Define well

373
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,271
Yeah

374
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
Surprising you think you did well that's

375
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Surprising

376
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
Well yeah I could have been 1.2 billion dollars you know I think 300

377
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
Unlike Norm you have to play by pro wrestling rules

378
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Where you don't break kayfabe

379
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
But even back

380
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Stabler still in character

381
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
You know there's still a

382
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Like

383
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Well out there

384
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Yeah yeah

385
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
When he goes home and it's all it's just him and his wife

386
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Takes the

387
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Takes the wig off

388
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
He doesn't actually have a ponytail

389
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,111
Completely baldino he removes the makeup

390
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:35,487
I mean it's it's tough but he's the only one who gets to see the real him

391
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Yeah yeah

392
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
He definitely has his

393
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Text out

394
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
I mean when

395
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
I first started researching

396
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Via what

397
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,471
What's happening here for the book

398
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
I went to see him at his offices in New Haven

399
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
And it's in his offices are in an old

400
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Victorian house

401
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
And he has

402
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,039
In what had been the dining room just the walls are lined with books

403
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
And he said his wife has an antiquarian books

404
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
Store

405
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
And

406
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
He and he said

407
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
Wait wait you bunches the antiquarian bookstore on the last episode do we talk to you

408
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
It was Norm's wife

409
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
No

410
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,239
No make no mistake

411
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Different is Aquarian bookstore

412
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
No hurry

413
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
Aquarian bookstore is someplace else

414
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
I think Barn somewhere

415
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
I just leave it there are two antiquarian book stores

416
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Well it gets weirder

417
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Because

418
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
He said

419
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
So he shows

420
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
These two very

421
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Very interesting antique books

422
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,983
And look at this one and when you do and it was in one of them as I recall was like one of those flip books you know

423
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
Where you get a moving picture when you flip the pages

424
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,175
And II books that I was thinking

425
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
Write this is a first edition Robinson Crusoe not like

426
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
What book is from the 70s that was a first edition of

427
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
They were very very although they were

428
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
But

429
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
But so you know

430
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
3M it was kind of like

431
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Let me dig out

432
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
Some really interesting finds for you

433
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
So

434
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
He comes up with

435
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
These three

436
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
And you know from his opening arguments

437
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,823
Norm price

438
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
Some self on how well-read he is

439
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
I think he sighted you know the Grateful off

440
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
The person

441
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
All the way down to shoshana zuboff

442
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
In his opening remarks

443
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,951
So and he he was talking about her book

444
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,839
As well when you do it not only during his opening remarks but you know back

445
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
In 2019 when I first visited with him

446
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,983
Anyway so you showed me these three books and I thought oh that's really interesting

447
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
And then couple months go by and

448
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,895
I read a profile of him in Connecticut magazine

449
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
As a reporter comes in and he says

450
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247

451
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551

Vito he's he's sort of the

457
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
You know he always says

458
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
That's the same thing you know

459
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,471

To come out wearing the same shirt

468
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Because they have a

469
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
A joke about the shirts

I'm particularly

528
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Interested

529
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
As those questions were coming in

530
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Hanging Lake

531
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
The deliberation went on

532
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,176
What was the what was the

533
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Flavor of

534
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Tension

535
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
In the courtroom

536
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,040
Asbestos you can describe it like

537
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Just like the I know that

538
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,880
It for us from far away there's a bit of

539
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
Confusion a bit of

540
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,280
Is it going to be today even on Wednesday it was like the end of the day

541
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
Wednesday

542
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Yeah yeah

543
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,680
I think by the end of Wednesday I specially at

544
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
After

545
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
They heard

546
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,568
William Sherlock's testimony again

547
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,688
And then they took him recess they went back to deliberate then there was lunch

548
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
And then they came out and they said

549
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Can we have a new copy of the verdict

550
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Warm

551
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,416
Because we wrote the wrong number on a line

552
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
And

553
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
And that was

554
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,792
Sitting in the back row

555
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
With

556
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Damn read that.

557
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Ontarian who's been recording these this trial

558
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
And others

559
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,592
And we both looked at each other you know eyebrows raised in there almost at the end do you know

560
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
Or does it mean you know there's

561
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,968
Still kind of making their way in and no one knew but

562
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,624
I was starting to by the end of the day on Wednesday really kind of lose hope that they were going to arrive at

563
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,696
I don't know why I just felt like they were

564
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
You know I

565
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,792
Caillou started

566
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
Wednesday over the weekend

567
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
About like

568
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
And then

569
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
You know speaking of Norm he started to say

570
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
I've got another

571
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
You know I've got another gig Bass

572
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
I need it you know I need to postpone this a little bit

573
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
Because I have to go pee in New York City and I

574
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,696
I can't monitor this case and I don't trust anyone else to monitor this

575
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
This case

576
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
I'm at or these deliberations so I can't be in two places

577
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Norbit

578
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Epistolary

579
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Do just Norm better

580
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Terrible stand up

581
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
It's it's

582
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,568
It's funny I remember whenever he broke into the

583
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Conversation with

584
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
The judge and just all the sudden was like

585
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
I can't be here until 2 on Thursday that's

586
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,760
I can do it everybody just went

587
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
What are we

588
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,344
What are you doing

589
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
Yeah I think I think

590
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,208
My jaw literally dropped when he said that I thought

591
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:40,608
Book to be on Rogan

592
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Bible book sorry about this one

593
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,472
It really was odd

594
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Yeah

595
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
Why don't we

596
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
Just

597
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
Cross that bridge when we get to it

598
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
So yeah

599
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
That gym

600
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Call Ian

601
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
She's very formal

602
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
Yeah that would have been

603
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
Insta korbut

604
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
So

605
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,840
So then we were thinking by the end of the day on Wednesday now we're looking at a really truncated day

606
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
On Thursday

607
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
Sure

608
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Then what

609
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Then we're at Fry's

610
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
So

611
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,872
And then you were also thinking about there were all these other things going on you know

612
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
We starting to pile up at the end of the week like the January 6th

613
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
I'm hearing on

614
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Thursday night and

615
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
I was just

616
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Starting to think about

617
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
You know

618
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:43,072
Are you going to be in Connecticut for the rest of your life like a Twilight Zone situation you know

619
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
You can't escape the restaurant

620
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
What's your William Shatner like at the whole thing

621
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
I get you

622
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,872
Groundhog Day in that in the hotel where which was just walking

623
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,432
Distance from the courtroom we're pretty much everybody

624
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
He was staying so

625
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Yeah so anyway so they

626
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,184
Surprised Us in the end you know they they when they ask for an Uber decorum it was because they really were at the very end

627
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
They were writing everything in

628
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
So

629
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,096
What was your feel when the first number was red

630
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
I

631
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
I was like

632
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
You know

633
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
That is a lot

634
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,432
Close I noticed a couple people were were speculating on Twitter they were saying

635
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,224
Okay Price is Right rules

636
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
You like so guess what's heard it going to be

637
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,624
Can't go over you know and so keep on

638
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
People were saying

639
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,672
You know

640
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
3

641
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,024
350 325

642
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
And I was thinking

643
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
That sounds ambitious

644
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
But

645
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,400
Given the number of

646
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Plaintiff

647
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
I don't know maybe

648
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah right when Robbie Parker caught 120

649
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
And you still had 14 plaintiff's to go

650
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
You were thinking

651
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
This is

652
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
Is going to be

653
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Historic

654
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
And then imagine that

655
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
Palpable

656
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
You like after Robbie's verdict

657
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
It was absolutely silent in a row

658
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
And

659
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
You know I mean

660
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
It wasn't

661
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
It was just sort of

662
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,424
Stunning

663
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
How quiet it was

664
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,776
And you know people were just listening

665
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,080
To the numbers and all you could hear were

666
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
No people like myself

667
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
Typing these numbers in

668
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
And you know try

669
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Keep track of them

670
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
And then

671
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
I was typing in in in New York

672
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
They were adding

673
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,160
Andre adding just to make sure everything was accurate

674
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
And

675
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,720
You know you started

676
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
Stevie start of exclamations of Woe and

677
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Oh my God

678
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
The moments

679
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:58,496
The moments I think they showed the Judgment they immediately cut to Robbie

680
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,432
It was it was you saw him put his head in his hands like very slowly and just keep it there

681
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,480
And it was very much like

682
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
I I could

683
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Vland

684
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Steve

685
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
Thought of

686
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,136
F****** we did it you know like it was

687
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
It was such a feeling of

688
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
I mean I imagine you could have

689
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Reached out

690
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Inhale victory in the air

691
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Like it was that kind of

692
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Intensity

693
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Yeah yeah

694
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
It was really incredible

695
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
It was a

696
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,824
Yeah I think nobody knew what to say it was just I mean

697
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:38,688
I just looked over at

698
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Lisa

699
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
You know

700
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
But

701
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
Came out like a different word

702
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
Anyway

703
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah

704
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
It was

705
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
It really was it was really a jaw-dropping

706
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,536
It was incredible

707
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Spell

708
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,120
And not to not to dwell on any like Shawn

709
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Freud or anything

710
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
But

711
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
What how is how is Norm

712
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm feeling a sense of his violent as this was

713
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
I did look over

714
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
He was

715
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,224
Staring straight ahead

716
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
You did not look at the lawyers

717
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
You did not turn around

718
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:22,208
Brandito I mean and then one of the things he was doing in the courtroom prior to that

719
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
Was

720
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
I like making nice

721
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,072
The people in the room you know at one point

722
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
You know Robbie Parker during one of the recesses

723
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
This was leaving the Roman

724
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,520
Norm was following him out the door and kind of like

725
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
Patted him on the back at another point

726
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Pat llodra who attended many days

727
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,808
Of the trial she was the former first selectman in Newtown when the shooting occurred with the equivalent of Mayor

728
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
And

729
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Yo what up to her and

730
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Said oh nothing

731
00:30:53,952 --> 00:31:00,096
Personal kind of thing it's all in the game

732
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,936
Especially in the courtroom he was just like I'm a gladiator in here

733
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
I'm fighting for my client and then

734
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
At the end of it is I am and it's

735
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,432
It's fun to be in the in the pit with your right Alex go have a beer and you're like no you're a monster dude I don't know what to tell you

736
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
In a case like this it's

737
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
It's really hard

738
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
To sort of

739
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Break

740
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
Text Tara like that you know

741
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Just

742
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
I'm not sure that that is something that people were buying I mean I won't speak for

743
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,144
Her Pat llodra or anyone like that but

744
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
Everybody obviously deserves a defense

745
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:43,616
Even if you're any less reputable of a lawyer

746
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
If you take those cases

747
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
But I also do

748
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Don't think that you need to

749
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Multiple points

750
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
During the case

751
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,368
Suggest that these grieving families are exaggerating their pain

752
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,720
I think that there might be another way to go about defending Alex

753
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
But doesn't involve

754
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Something

755
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
That distasteful really does require like

756
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
I mean

757
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,448
If you are in a vacuum trying to think up defense

758
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,776
Strategies I can understand why this would go up on the White

759
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Skateboard you know

760
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
But once it's up there you should be like

761
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:20,480
And this is an inhuman thing to do now that we should not do

762
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,880
We can scratch this one off but ended when your brainstorming your like her could happen you know this is strategy

763
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Fashion or something like that

764
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,744
But when you behave the way Norm did and right now you know

765
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
It's not that they defended Alex

766
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
That was the reason

767
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Did they were

768
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
The way they did it that was so

769
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Disrespect

770
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
But here's where you know

771
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
As you guys know

772
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
Better than anybody

773
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
This is where

774
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
No

775
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,968
You have to consider who's the client and as rain all told me during the

776
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
Trial in Austin

777
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
Alex calls all

778
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
The shot

779
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,648
Cuz I said will he be testifying and he said

780
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,184
It's up to Alec

781
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
And then he goes

782
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
Everything is up to Alex

783
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,376
And so what they were putting on it was why I sent that Alex

784
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:16,288
Yeah so you know in a normal client relationship you would

785
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
You would

786
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,616
As as you guys were just saying you know you'd say

787
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
Note Let's cross that one off we're not going to be accusing the families of anything you know that's what got us into

788
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
This mess

789
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
And that's how I'm going to end up paying a billion dollars

790
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Hey Ya

791
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,440
But you know

792
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
Person after person in these trials has testified

793
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
Alex calls all the shots

794
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Alex runs the show

795
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,472
The show runs on Alex there would be no Infowars if not for Alice

796
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
Alex makes all the decisions Alex said to do that Alex

797
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,848
What's checked on this Alex one bat

798
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,176
So that was the defense that he wanted

799
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
And so

800
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
You got the judgment

801
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
That that kind of Defense

802
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Produces

803
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm not affect

804
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
No no no not effective

805
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,584
Import matter until and say I'm done apologizing

806
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Two families that work

807
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,960
Still weeping because they had just watched Robbie's and Tire

808
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,312
Tribute to his daughter the night after the shooting on video

809
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
CO2 to sort of

810
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Say it

811
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,248
Not sort of state to literally say I'm done apologizing is

812
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
You do not

813
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Strategic

814
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
Put it that way

815
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
And a thing

816
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
The courtroom is a struggle session

817
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
It doesn't play very well

818
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,840
Comment which surprise

819
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
You know audience of one

820
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,032
You know a lot of the things he said in the courtroom I felt like okay he knows Alex's watch

821
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,848
Watching the live feed he's performing for the audience

822
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,920
Well I mean you just apparently lost

823
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,504
Does radio show so you might be coming on

824
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
Infowars

825
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Roster

826
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,392
After the War Room there's the norm room

827
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Right

828
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
Kid Robert Barnes

829
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
Condition together they absolutely hate each other so

830
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:18,400
They couldn't do a show together cuz neither of them has very low

831
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,680
Yeah

832
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
I feel like

833
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Since we have you here there are two things

834
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,592
They come up that the audience

835
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Probably has

836
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Questions about

837
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Is the judges shoes

838
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Oh yes

839
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,248
There's some question

840
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
The people have about the

841
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
Right okay

842
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Are there

843
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
I don't know

844
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,208
Are there any questions about the judge issues

845
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Tweeting about the judges shoes

846
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
I was

847
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,400
You were doing about the judge I did

848
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,752
What's going on today

849
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Okay

850
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,824
It's true I tweeted about her shoes

851
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:01,664
Yes no she she has her

852
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,504
Collection of shoes and I think you know as a couple people pointed out

853
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,344
When you're wearing you know long flowing black judge's robes

854
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
There's not a lot

855
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:17,536
Two I mean Ruth Bader Ginsburg distinguished herself by wearing those lace collars that made near that became so icon

856
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Sonic and I think judge Bellis

857
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,936
Kind of did that by wearing a lot of really interesting shoes

858
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
So

859
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
Don't give your own personality a little bit when you have

860
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,384
Something a uniform so much like a black robe

861
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,688
Yeah I have something for you

862
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,552
That at some point though penetrate your mind to how stupid the f****** robe is

863
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,184
If you're like I see I'm getting around the whole respectful judge Thing by wearing flashy shoes

864
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
I just wear a f******

865
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
This is one of your longstanding things about uniform

866
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
I see you can't wear shorts but I wear a big boot

867
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
I hate it

868
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
I think

869
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,872
The my problem with it is they go halfway

870
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Cuz I can

871
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
You know the Commonwealth

872
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
Countries

873
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
You Faking It

874
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah well I feel like I regret bringing up at 2

875
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,936
So hurt her shoes were always really interesting

876
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
You know usually they're usually

877
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,800
Primarily black

878
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,408
But there were kind of high heels and get a one-point black and white

879
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
It sort of you know what

880
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
What

881
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,016
You might call

882
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Spectator pumps

883
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
And some really interesting here really nice-looking shoes

884
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
I was just noticing that I have miss you purse

885
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
I was noticing that

886
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,656
And then on Burdick day it was almost as if she knew because she was wearing these zebra stripe

887
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,544
Shoes with a red bow and a vivid red heel

888
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Do not

889
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
Suggest that she may already have known it advance

890
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,832
I know you're right you're right

891
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
Didn't know anything about the music

892
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:23,744
But it was but it just happened to be the most

893
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Define buoyant shoe day

894
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
Kim

895
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Dim the judge

896
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
See Twitter

897
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
Like the judge can

898
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
Google

899
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:41,664
No face she probably that you had an interest in her shoes

900
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
It might have been for you we are talking about a lot of audiences at 1 today

901
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Honor

902
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,952
Your honor it's an honor your shoes are honorable

903
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,512
Me with these shoes

904
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Your sisters are right

905
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
And then I guess

906
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
B b s

907
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,424
Sing

908
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
I apologize if this is

909
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Bring up something that's

910
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
It's a sore subject

911
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,104
I'll be there was a little bit of controversy with a tweet

912
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
That you put out

913
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,504
And I feel like if I didn't bring this up it would feel like I was

914
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
Not bringing it up on purpose

915
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Protecting me

916
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
I feel like

917
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
You know it

918
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
It's a pretty simple x

919
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,696
What nation

920
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
And

921
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Do you want to

922
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Like layout what happened

923
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Absolutely

924
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,424
So I'm a day after Alex Jones test

925
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Certified

926
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
I know

927
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
Norm got up and he was

928
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,592
His testimony was supposed to continue the next day

929
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,480
So Norm would have you no had a chance to examine you his own client is the defendant

930
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,808
And he declined and he said

931
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:57,184
So we will assume given what we said earlier about Alex calling all the shots so Alex didn't want to test

932
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Buy a second day

933
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
So Norm said

934
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,912
I think you know it's probably best instead I am and also I think so

935
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:12,800
Strategically there some lawyers nor commenting on Twitter who are more knowledgeable and you know I'm not on the legal

936
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Strategy

937
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
And and they were saying

938
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,944
It's favorable to his client if Norm Woods

939
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
Decline to do the cross like that and in

940
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,088
Said call his own client as the defense with

941
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
So

942
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
He reserved the right to do that

943
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
They made a deal with the family's lawyers where they would have the right

944
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
The cross

945
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,840
If you if Norm called him and he came back

946
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
And so Norm said

947
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
He's not going to testify today

948
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
He's going to come back now

949
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Next week

950
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
I will call him as a witness and this is agreeable to the family's lawyers and then they will have another crack at

951
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Basically

952
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
And he and what he said was

953
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
That'll lower the temperature in the room

954
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,576
You know I think it will be better

955
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
So

956
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
I interpreted that

957
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,464
And having seen the jurors reaction

958
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
2

959
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,024
Jones is testimony

960
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
The day prior

961
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
I interpreted that as

962
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,400
You know Norm says

963
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,496
His client has damaged himself

964
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
So much

965
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
That you might want to give the

966
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
The jury of Grey

967
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,360
Something to that effect

968
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Which I think

969
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,432
If that's a reading of

970
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Lower.

971
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
No.

972
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
Serta says

973
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Things didn't go so well yesterday

974
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
Let's calm down and I'll bring it back

975
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,072
But what my error was

976
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
I said that he said that

977
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
You know the way I worded the

978
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
If it were my interpretation that would have been one thing that would have been

979
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Bi-Rite

980
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,104
But but I said something to the effect

981
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
He says

982
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Yeah

983
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
So

984
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,735
You know I'm after the recess

985
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,551
Head hospital because you didn't use

986
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Quotation mark

987
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
So you know

988
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
It wasn't like a direct

989
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,671
Quoting of him

990
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
But yeah the word said was in there

991
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,327
Those are as ghetto as saying or something like that

992
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
So that makes it sound like you know.

993
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
That was what he

994
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
He told the judge

995
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
When he did not

996
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
So

997
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
After the recess

998
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
He came back

999
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
It was clear that

1000
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,871
You know Jones had seen this

1001
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,991
Call Vic to his attention or someone at Infowars but maybe Jones

1002
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
And so he came back and he was just

1003
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
Really angry and he was saying

1004
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,975
I don't know why you know Elizabeth Williamson of the New York Times is

1005
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Covering this

1006
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,303
She's written a book about their son

1007
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,375
You know she shouldn't have this courtroom in

1008
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,447
How anyone could have interpreted what I said

1009
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
As

1010
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
He's damaged

1011
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
And the judge

1012
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,031
Karma

1013
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
And she was like we're not doing this

1014
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Here that's not what

1015
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
This trial is about

1016
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:03,039
You know I've already told you you know stop talking over me something like that

1017
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
And and so

1018
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
He tried again and she stopped

1019
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
And then that was that

1020
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
And I thought

1021
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
If he's

1022
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,535
Calling me out for something I better see what the problem is

1023
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
You know

1024
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
So

1025
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
I followed him out of the courtroom

1026
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,983
And when we got in the hallway I turned on my

1027
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
Recorder on my phone

1028
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Cuz I wanted to hear what he had to say

1029
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,895
And he was like I'm not talking to you and I said well

1030
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Are you

1031
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
Talking so you just wanted to

1032
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Say that in front of the

1033
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
You know so my alternative

1034
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,903
If you have a problem with something I've written I want to hear you out

1035
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,207
Or are you just

1036
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Saying that for the judge and for the cameras

1037
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
And he was like

1038
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
He went into this big thing

1039
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,471
So we got into the elevator he had all of his files and his

1040
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Briefcase

1041
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
That's really

1042
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Stuffed balloon

1043
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,127
Paper red

1044
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,711
Hoping exploded in the elevator

1045
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
And

1046
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
Papers

1047
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,831
Files every and I said do you need a hand

1048
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
And

1049
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
He was like not from you

1050
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
Basically telling me like

1051
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,191
He was like you shouldn't be here you shouldn't be covering this I said well I think I know a lot about this case

1052
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
And

1053
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
And he and then he kind of

1054
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,895
You know I was like what is the problem and he finally did you know I'm following him out onto the street

1055
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,223
You finally got to the point where he said

1056
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,855
The problem is you said that I said that he damaged himself and I said I didn't

1057
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
Say that and he said

1058
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,439
No you did go back and look I said I will go back

1059
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
And if

1060
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
If I did

1061
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
I'd say that I will correct

1062
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Because that's

1063
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Responsible

1064
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
And

1065
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,191
And he said I would appreciate it and then he said

1066
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
Because

1067
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
People are thinking that

1068
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,567
The upshot was

1069
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
People are thinking that I told you that

1070
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
Yeah

1071
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,223
And that I'm in bed with New York Times

1072
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,015
Meaning like I'm bedded with

1073
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
You know the paper another words like from spider room

1074
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,879
Yeah but he yeah it's so

1075
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
So there is no

1076
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,463
You can imagine Jones

1077
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,535
Seeing this or someone in on his

1078
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,583
Stop CMAs insane

1079
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Is Norm pattis talking to the New York Times and

1080
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Telling them that

1081
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,959
That was what I thought

1082
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Weird

1083
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,287
Because it's not like Alex to be parent

1084
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
That would be an odd thing for him to do

1085
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
Usually it's pretty chill.

1086
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,479
I assume that Norm did not

1087
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
Immediately

1088
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,319
Immediately get struck by an iron table

1089
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
Right leg

1090
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
No God struck him down for his

1091
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
Whining about somebody

1092
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,999
Slightly misquoting him maybe

1093
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
If you look at it the wrong way

1094
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,607
Like he does realize what

1095
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
He's in court

1096
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Right

1097
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah I mean

1098
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:03,519
But my job as reporter was just

1099
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
If I mischaracterized

1100
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,847
You know or if I

1101
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
If I said he said that and he did not then it's my job.

1102
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
2

1103
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Correct.

1104
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
So I would

1105
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
I also think if you just said

1106
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
Turnabout is fair play

1107
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
He might have been like I touche

1108
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
And then you guys going to just moved on

1109
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Well

1110
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
Yeah but then I wouldn't have been doing my job

1111
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
So

1112
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
I just said

1113
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
You know

1114
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,519
If it's wrong oh correct I'll go back and look at it so I went back and looked at it and I did say

1115
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
Says

1116
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
So I

1117
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,407
Fix it I took it down and then I provided an explanation

1118
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,783
And of course that became material for Infowars and you know

1119
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Reporter lied after you know she lied and was caught

1120
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Tell them that they can

1121
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
Can try and come after you for a billion-dollar

1122
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
Good luck

1123
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,143
Really unfortunate that

1124
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,471
You know the real world plays by

1125
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
You know that

1126
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Semi

1127
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
To fully responsible rules

1128
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Where is

1129
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,103
This is something

1130
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,687
Thing that you obviously feel the obligation to and the professional

1131
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
Responsibility to make eclairs

1132
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
Navigation and direction

1133
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,807
People like Alex

1134
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
And his fans

1135
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
This becomes

1136
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
Proof of like

1137
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
Some kind of an intentional lie

1138
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:28,255
And it's just

1139
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,791
Responses to your

1140
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
Clarification tweeting it was

1141
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
Yeah not good

1142
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
You were kind of hose

1143
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
The moment that we came out it wouldn't have mattered what you whether you took it down or apologize or explain it or whatever

1144
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
Who's going to be on the show

1145
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,687
And I would like

1146
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,223
And you were you were there

1147
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,111
Clarification is really for the audience of I guess your employer more

1148
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,231
Norm they don't care for your soul

1149
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
Your soul is probably pretty important

1150
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,047
Yeah

1151
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,863
I mean we are you know this is a trial about truth

1152
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Unreality

1153
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
And so

1154
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,679
You know it

1155
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Always helpful

1156
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Especially to those days

1157
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
Weekend so

1158
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,847
Yeah because I did not say that

1159
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
I thought okay bear

1160
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
I'm going to change it

1161
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
So

1162
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,271
Yeah so that I knew you know of course

1163
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,879
This would be material for them that you know this would be

1164
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,255
A chance for them to you know take away act and

1165
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Yeah

1166
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,559
It's sad what they do

1167
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
So unfortunate

1168
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
That this is like

1169
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,959
Like the angle they take on Infowars not that you flushed half a donut

1170
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
You know like this is

1171
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,311
This is what Alex

1172
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
I think that donut one under-the-radar don't you

1173
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,199
Yeah I think so I think you lucked out on that

1174
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
Who is like you know we have

1175
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,855
For you this is probably like

1176
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
As chaotic

1177
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
Or as much as

1178
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
Drama as there is surrounding

1179
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
The case and you compare that

1180
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,559
To Alex

1181
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,399
His performance on the stand or falling asleep Norm saying that

1182
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,959
The families are exaggerating their grief

1183
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
I think the balance here is

1184
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
Pretty clear

1185
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
Yeah i o n

1186
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
The that was the other thing in that conversation you know writing down the elevator and all that you talking to Norm

1187
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
He said

1188
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,159
You said I fell asleep as if that was some big scoop

1189
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,463
I said I just said you fall asleep

1190
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,047
And and he said I was not sleeping

1191
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
He said I was

1192
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
I was saying I was

1193
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Signaling that

1194
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:46,239
We had spent enough time on Gilligan's Island that was when

1195
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,311
Chris Maddie that the attorney for the families

1196
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Was

1197
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,431
Questioning the Britney pasta Infowars corporate representative

1198
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:59,551
I know and he said he was sending a signal that we had spent too much time I said

1199
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,135
You normally sleeping it was on video

1200
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,439
Anna and he was inside

1201
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
The thing that it wasn't anything he told me that

1202
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
Get my head out of my own you know

1203
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Yeah

1204
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
So it was an elaborate signal it was very subtle and get complicated if that was

1205
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,823
What he was trying to signal but I respect people who take unconventional

1206
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,687
Messaging approach reprimanded for not standing up when he approached

1207
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
The judge or ask the judges question

1208
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,783
Until we figure it if I'm going to stay down

1209
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
I might as well

1210
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:40,767
Some of the objections that he would make from his state it was almost like it was like you pictures

1211
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,839
Someone like on his shaved long with a cigarette

1212
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,239
Oman

1213
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
Get on your feet

1214
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,431
Yeah that was

1215
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,735
When that was kind of a pair of shoes

1216
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
I got them up

1217
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,087
What would that was kind of like where things were like a traded

1218
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
The beginning that like

1219
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
Like you need to stand up

1220
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
But you're going to

1221
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
Speak to the court

1222
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,207
Isaac this is go

1223
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
Is it going to be an interesting scratch

1224
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
Yeah I think one of the one of the things I notice

1225
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Text was that

1226
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Norm spoke

1227
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,215
Progressively less as the weeks went on

1228
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,263
Sure you could you could really come on

1229
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,615
Yeah you could really kind of measure it that first week he did as much as he could do

1230
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
The second week he pulled back and by the third week he was like I'm not going to cross the

1231
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
Examine anybody

1232
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,527
I'm just going to say go for it

1233
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
You know

1234
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Yeah

1235
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,903
Yeah I thought I was a little too

1236
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,951
Surprised with that because some of his

1237
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,095
You know messaging to the media in you know the years leading up to the trial was sort of

1238
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Well these families thing

1239
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
Think that

1240
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:57,567
They'll do you know that they won't be examined themselves will they will be and

1241
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,967
You know he had a lot of what we know he had a lot of their personal records and and health record

1242
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,295
Birds and things like that in the reason we know that as of course they were

1243
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
Wrongly transmitted to the attorneys

1244
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
In Texas

1245
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,487
And you know he had to come up for a hearing on that

1246
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
Is that should have been done

1247
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
So you know

1248
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,655
But once the families were on the stand and test

1249
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,447
Buying as to what they've been through

1250
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,751
And very little to say

1251
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,543
He didn't you know

1252
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:32,127
Robbie Parker and what Robbie is an indoor in this case

1253
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,943
Over the years from Alex Jones wear

1254
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,503
He played that you no openings

1255
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,647
As of Robbie Parker press conference the night after his daughter Emily was killed

1256
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
At Sandy Hook

1257
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,255
Over and over and over again for years

1258
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
So Robbie was really at the

1259
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,071
The center of

1260
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,679
This case and Alyssa Parker Emily's mom also test

1261
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
And

1262
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
She's not a play

1263
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
Plaintiff but the two of them just

1264
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
Portray and you know just

1265
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
Painted this

1266
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
Nightmare of You Know

1267
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
Gordmans and deathrun

1268
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,599
Pets and people knowing where they lived and a man confronting Robbie you know

1269
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
4 years after

1270
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,695
The shooting on the street in Seattle

1271
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
And all of these things

1272
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
And Norm did have

1273
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,095
It did not have a single question for either one of us

1274
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
Which was really

1275
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Kerning

1276
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,447
Surprise

1277
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
But

1278
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:34,591
Then again this is testimony so powerful that you wonder really what

1279
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
What is there to say

1280
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,711
You can only kind of make it worse for yourself I think

1281
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,247
I think it is Crossing

1282
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
But he did do

1283
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,855
With a couple of the plaintiff's was just about like

1284
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
You have

1285
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
A charity

1286
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Suspicious

1287
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Yeah

1288
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,255
Yeah and I think that there wasn't theirs

1289
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
Is a couple attempt

1290
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,815
Said that

1291
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
With some of the first

1292
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Q

1293
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,423
Folks and then I think it's just a good system defect

1294
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
No maybe like Alexa

1295
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
Just not even do anything

1296
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
I think they I think Norm really

1297
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Try to be

1298
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,127
Beginning to hammer that like all these guys are just going out

1299
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
For money the lawyers are ambulance Chasers

1300
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
And then

1301
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,295
Yeah exactly trying to inject

1302
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Politics

1303
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:21,951
And that was against the rules the judge had said you cannot talk about electoral politics

1304
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
You can't talk about political figures

1305
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:29,631
You can't discuss Jones's finances cuz we remember and in in off

1306
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
Boston in August

1307
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,679
Yo he tried

1308
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,983
They wrongly that he was bankrupt

1309
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,823
And that two million would be more than he could you know just about all the

1310
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
Or more than he can handle

1311
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
I'm in terms of a of a verdict

1312
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,271
So Olive that was serve off the table

1313
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
But you know Warriors try to you know get around that Independence and then presenting there

1314
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Cases in so

1315
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,791
Yeah couple times in mentioning some of the families charities

1316
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
Yeah he was talking about well

1317
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,727
Basically isn't this about gun violence isn't this about gun control

1318
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
Politics

1319
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,287
Bo that

1320
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,639
Didn't you a well he mentioned this when the wheelers testified because

1321
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
Francine wheeler

1322
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
About

1323
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,551
Can't remember how long after the shooting of the month or two

1324
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,343
After the shooting

1325
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
Delivered

1326
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,159
President Obama's

1327
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
About radio address

1328
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,559
Santa Saturday in this was when the families were pushing for expanded background checks

1329
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,887
I'm in that legislation wound up bailing but

1330
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,983
As part of that effort she delivered the radio address in Norm brought that up

1331
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
So it's a way to get both

1332
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Guns and politics

1333
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
You know

1334
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
Into the

1335
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,895
The jury's Minds

1336
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,967
And I think the council is there may have been

1337
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,551
But there would have been some people on the jury might have been sympathetic

1338
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:57,439
That argument that I'm okay so this what there was a political aspect here or something like that

1339
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
But

1340
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,255
I think as

1341
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
Stories mounted andaz

1342
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,911
You know just the sort of horror of what some of these people had in George

1343
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
Became more and more

1344
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Parents

1345
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
I think he know

1346
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,311
Norm

1347
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,359
Wisely decided that

1348
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:22,271
This wouldn't be worth it but you know site trying to say oh well you voted for Hillary Clinton

1349
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Not going to cut it

1350
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
When you have drawers weeping

1351
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,647
Abbey idea that you know

1352
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,463
People who had just lost their loved ones we're getting

1353
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,231
Deathrun

1354
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,255
That's rape threats

1355
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
People

1356
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
Threatening to dig up their murder

1357
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,679
Children and I was talking about defiling their grave

1358
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,775
You know saying wasn't this all about gun control just started

1359
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,055
Pills as an argument

1360
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,639
Yeah yeah yeah and I think that

1361
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,455
You know whatever you can inject

1362
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Into that

1363
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Is kind of useless

1364
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Wants

1365
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
The understanding

1366
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
Of the Damned

1367
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Image being the

1368
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,975
It making it so you can't

1369
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:07,839
Properly grieve and reopening wounds over and over and over and over and over again

1370
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
The notion of

1371
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Real political

1372
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,447
Ideas

1373
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
While distracted

1374
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,239
Right

1375
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
Probably not that he'll

1376
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Now

1377
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
Yeah it was just

1378
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
It was just too powerful and too often

1379
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
You know that

1380
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:27,551
Just to hear that day after day what you know

1381
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
What is 4

1382
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
People had

1383
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
Gone through and

1384
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
And the kind of like

1385
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:36,511
Do you know if the jury was watching them in the courtroom.

1386
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
Saturday you know just

1387
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Stoic

1388
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,143
And pulled together and consoling each other and

1389
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
It was

1390
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
Extremely powerful

1391
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,775
And I think that's

1392
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
Another reason that

1393
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,383
Alex Jones didn't return to the courtroom because

1394
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
We saw what happened when

1395
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Scarlet

1396
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,551
Louis through an accident of timing wound up

1397
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
No

1398
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,903
Confronting him and for 90 minutes addressing

1399
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
The answer

1400
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:11,071
To every question directly at Alex Jones and asking him you don't why are you doing this

1401
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
And

1402
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,935
Truth is so important to our society truth is the Bedrock

1403
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
On which our democracy rests

1404
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,287
You say you're concerned about the country

1405
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
And you're spreading things like this

1406
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
What what

1407
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,407
Wrong with you

1408
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,199
And I think

1409
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
At all cost I mean having watch

1410
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Him

1411
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,111
Literally sweat through his shirt while she was talking to him

1412
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
I think

1413
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
The idea of

1414
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,719
Sitting in front of

1415
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,511
15 plaintiff

1416
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
Just

1417
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
I don't think you can do it

1418
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
I really don't I think he was afraid

1419
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,447
I mean we've talked about this a bit.

1420
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Can't blame him

1421
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
If you look at it from his perspective

1422
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,359
There's a choice to not have to do that yet

1423
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
It seemed like it would be a

1424
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Almost

1425
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
Psyche Crusher

1426
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:07,647
It is it is a little bit like if Alex is directing the defense strategy inexplicably

1427
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
By himself

1428
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:15,839
Somehow at the same time recognizes that him being on the stand is a bad thing for him

1429
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Yeah

1430
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,423
He doesn't realize that those two are essentially the same

1431
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,471
There's actually the same problem

1432
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,031
Him being on the stand would be him defending himself

1433
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
In the exact same way as him

1434
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,223
Creating this defendant running the defenses bad for him but he didn't get that

1435
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
Somehow

1436
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,599
There was something I wanted to ask you guys about because you

1437
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Alex Jones

1438
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,951
I do not own any spectator pumps

1439
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
0

1440
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,559
Talk about that late

1441
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:52,959
So I really wanted it so one of the things that Chris Maddie one of the lawyers for the families

1442
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
Mention was

1443
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,079
And I just found myself actually even in the moment

1444
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,199
You were saying that

1445
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
What are the reasons that

1446
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
James Johnston testify

1447
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
More

1448
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Is that

1449
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,159
It's really important to him

1450
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,183
Be on the outs

1451
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,487
Outside calling this all a sham

1452
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,535
Because he thinks

1453
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
That

1454
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
The more time you would have

1455
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,887
Spence in the courtroom and I don't want to

1456
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
I don't want to miss

1457
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,751
Restate what his message but I think this is pretty

1458
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
Close to wedding say

1459
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,175
Any is closest to the if you got close to this process

1460
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
That would sort of

1461
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Opposed him

1462
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
As

1463
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,039
This guy who's just

1464
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
A huckster and selling products

1465
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,647
And doing it you know On The Backs

1466
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
So these people

1467
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,791
And lying about this and having to acknowledge that he had been lying about this

1468
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
Spring years

1469
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,375
That that would damage him with his audience

1470
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,679
And I and I said

1471
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
Chris at the

1472
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Time

1473
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
I don't know

1474
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Because

1475
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,359
His audience seems to sort of a

1476
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
Accommodate

1477
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
A lot of

1478
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:09,503
What he says or changes in you no changes in his story or whatever

1479
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,575
Yeah your side for sure

1480
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,135
I think that

1481
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,975
The audiences trap

1482
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
I think

1483
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
For the most part

1484
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
And they can rationalize quite a bit

1485
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
That that that that happens

1486
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
And

1487
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,727
You know all it takes if Alex has a bad day

1488
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Is this a it was a good day

1489
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,615
And have Barnes come on yeah they can talk for an hour about how

1490
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,687
Everything is unfair if only he could defend

1491
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
Himself

1492
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,759
If only he could say the name Trump

1493
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
The nailery

1494
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Then everything would be

1495
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,831
Refine right

1496
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
Like I think that

1497
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,415
I think that what Maddie saying make

1498
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Sense

1499
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
And

1500
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
To do the out

1501
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
Outside world

1502
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,351
He would be exposed

1503
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,655
Sure they is a liar and a con man

1504
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
But that that audience

1505
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,823
They have so many opportunities to realize this out

1506
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Sidedoor courtroom

1507
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,919
I have said that no bottom far too many times for me too

1508
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
Pull back on that now

1509
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,527
No matter what he does

1510
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,135
When he did when he was testifying he was talking about his bit

1511
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,183
Coin thing at

1512
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,207
Bobby said

1513
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,767
You're going to use this in a commercial

1514
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
And then Alex.

1515
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
Use it in a commercial

1516
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Like

1517
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
Probably not even voice

1518
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
Yeah they were like this is the smartest

1519
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
Dude that ever lived

1520
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,335
You get much more

1521
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Trying to profit off the

1522
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,455
The trial when Alex was in front of the courthouse

1523
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
He had his book in his hand

1524
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Like when he was

1525
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,831
Interviewing with like local news outlets

1526
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
Like yeah

1527
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Flown back

1528
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
To Connecticut

1529
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Doesn't test

1530
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
Spotify

1531
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:58,047
Instead does these press conferences where he's clearly trying to put product

1532
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:58,815
ProgressBook

1533
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
On the local news

1534
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,119
And it's like

1535
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,727
I am is the audience can't see through a lot of that stuff I don't know what hope there is

1536
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,031
For anyone

1537
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:12,383
Away and he's going Infowars you giving and I won't do it here

1538
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,919
Giving the URL

1539
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:20,319
Yeah I would mean I would say if Kristen just said you know the more time he's in the court the last time he's selling

1540
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,879
I think that would make more sense to me than anything else

1541
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,439
When he's not moving product

1542
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,487
You might be moving some but it'll be less

1543
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:33,631
It'll be less effective if Owen is pointing out hey look there's Alex in the courtroom boy it sounds bad

1544
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:39,007
Oh no sounds good

1545
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
About it

1546
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:47,967
Oh yeah so it sounds like yeah that was a sort of Devon King argument that you know something that money

1547
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,295
Funny Posner who really began this whole effort

1548
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,831
To call Alex Jones

1549
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Account

1550
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:56,671
You learned early on that the bunking doesn't really work

1551
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Also the idea of light

1552
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,047
Exposing Alex Jones will be upset

1553
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Opposed

1554
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,143
You know a person who lies and sells products on the back of

1555
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
Tragedy Etc

1556
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,311
Sort of in a way reminded me of you how difficult it is to

1557
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,591
To talk someone out of

1558
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,407
A conspiracy theory that they have already fully embrace

1559
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
That his audience is

1560
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,527
As you said damn you know Captivate they

1561
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
Therein

1562
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
So

1563
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
They have their choices

1564
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,927
Is to accommodate but to repudiate him I think

1565
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
I don't know what that

1566
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Would take

1567
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
Well and I think the

1568
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,839
So many of the people obviously we've heard

1569
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,399
Much more explicit stories about this as it relates to

1570
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,679
Qanon but like

1571
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:46,591
A lot of the people in the audience or financially in the hole because of Alex I like in debt but they

1572
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
Spend a lot of money they're committed in that way

1573
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
Airfield dumb

1574
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
If they realize oi've

1575
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
I've been scammed for all this

1576
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Or they've

1577
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,599
Alienated family members loved ones

1578
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,927
Isolated themselves and insulated in a

1579
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,975
A bubble of people who are

1580
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,511
Amenable

1581
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,535
To Alex Jones

1582
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:10,655
Conspiracies a eating and reinforcing it back and back to them yeah there's a lot of

1583
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Invest

1584
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,239
Emotional and financial that they

1585
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
Take it on

1586
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
Do you to believe this

1587
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Stuff and I think

1588
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,663
Alex always talks about the

1589
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
The Nigerian

1590
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Email scam

1591
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Because I think he got

1592
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
That he definitely didn't get tricked by multiple times

1593
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
Multiple friends

1594
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,183
To have fallen

1595
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,767
Run for it and like you fall for the first email and then you fall

1596
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,559
For the second because you don't want to admit that

1597
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
The first was a

1598
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
A fraud

1599
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,703
I think that there's some Dynamic of that with his audience

1600
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,799
I don't know if a courtroom is going to

1601
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Penetrate

1602
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
Take that

1603
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,455
Cuz that's the reality world and that's not where they are living

1604
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
It can be super effective though in helping

1605
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
When people knock

1606
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,063
Fall into alley

1607
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,343
Lexus suire

1608
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
That could be

1609
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,695
And effect you'd have a good have like a ironically

1610
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
Calculations

1611
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,351
Yeah I mean it's a little bit like no matter how many times I proved the Earth

1612
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,167
Is more than 10,000 years old I'm not going to convince

1613
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
A lot of

1614
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
Yeah

1615
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
The forest

1616
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,311
Before we wrap up

1617
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,359
I wanted to ask about

1618
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
The feelings

1619
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
And like

1620
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,223
How things sit

1621
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,295
I mean obviously I don't want to be I don't know why I asked you like

1622
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,855
What are the family say or anything

1623
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,695
This process is over but it's also not over

1624
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
Yeah

1625
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
That's got to feel like

1626
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:41,535
Cathartic

1627
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
But at the same time

1628
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:46,143
There's still a road to travel there still

1629
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
The looming

1630
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,703
Notion of a

1631
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Kiehl's

1632
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
They're still

1633
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
You know I mean I don't think

1634
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:56,127
Appeals going to work but if there is an appeal there may be another trial

1635
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,919
Right after retry

1636
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,455
How like

1637
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,247
Buick Japanese cents over the

1638
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
The feeling of

1639
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,463
I don't even know what I'm trying to ask you one Gettysburg with the Civil War is not over yet you know like how are you

1640
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,767
Feeling about that process moving forward

1641
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Yeah

1642
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:19,935
So without you know betraying any individual confidences I think I just immuno end

1643
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,727
No I don't like

1644
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,031
Speak for the families as a group

1645
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
Cuz that's just not

1646
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
Right

1647
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
But

1648
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
What I ain't ya what I from what I gathered

1649
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,015
First of all a gigantic

1650
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Exhale

1651
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,111
In the room and you know just ascenso

1652
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,183

Weight kinds of Becker story

1654
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
Yeah we we

1655
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,839
We were able to tell the world what

1656
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
Happened

1657
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,887
We're able to

1658
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
Wayne bikes

1659
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
Explaining what happened

1660
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
We're able to

1661
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Explain

1662
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,031
Dangers here

1663
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:00,383
Officer of culture of disinformation and lies for profit

1664
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
And you know and

1665
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Explain that

1666
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,759
This is a phenomenon that's not

1667
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Find Tower

1668
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Alex Jones

1669
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,391
And has really in the decade since Sandy Hook

1670
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
Occurred again and again

1671
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,743
And you know he himself and

1672
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,303
Disappointing made in the story I wrote about

1673
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,071
The verdict

1674
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Yo he has

1675
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,887
Been apart of

1676
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,935
Most of the

1677
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
Highest-profile

1678
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
Bible lies

1679
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,151
Decade since Sandy Hook you know whether you're talkin about or

1680
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,735
No coronavirus myths and and anti-vax

1681
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Stuffin

1682
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:43,135
You're the great replacement theory that drove the violence in Charlotte

1683
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,951
It's Bill and certainly the 2020

1684
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,023
Election conspiracy theories that led to the violence at the

1685
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
The capitol on January 6th so

1686
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:51,839
You know

1687
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
I think

1688
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,191
That their sense was by speaking

1689
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,007
About what happened to them and how this all got

1690
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,311
Started and how long it lasted

1691
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
They were sneaking today

1692
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
You know and really

1693
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
Try to help

1694
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,759
You know

1695
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,295
Claiming you do

1696
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,111
Not only planning their at their need of their

1697
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,695
Their story and you and then saying you know this is

1698
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:25,119
Is Robbie put it you know in the press conference after work near he found his voice he was smiling about

1699
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,703
For so long because he didn't want the abuse to get worse

1700
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,519
He was really worried about the safety of his family

1701
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
And I

1702
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,615
And you know he he finally got

1703
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,663
Appoint when he saw that note

1704
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,711
Parkland parents were

1705
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,759
Receiving the same kind of abuse

1706
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
And that

1707
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,087
Just horrible statistic that today

1708
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,903
Nearly 20% of Americans believe that

1709
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,463
Every high-profile mass shooting is a plot

1710
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
By the government

1711
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
They were able to sort of say

1712
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,655
Is something really

1713
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,471
Serious that is not only impacting us

1714
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,751
This is not a one-off

1715
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,591
This we were that you Noah foundational story and what is

1716
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,127
Now phenomenon

1717
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,455
And the fact that they were able to raise that I think

1718
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,271
Was was really satisfying to them and

1719
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,063
And we owe them

1720
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
Our gratitude for that

1721
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,719
As you could see from watching the proceedings it did not come easily

1722
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,767
For them to noses

1723
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,559
Extremely painful for them to

1724
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,351
2

1725
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
You

1726
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:34,751
Brett outraged that alarm and and you know and relay and

1727
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,799
Recall would have happened

1728
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Yeah

1729
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:44,735
Yeah so I think in that sense you know and again sticking with what Robbie was saying after work

1730
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
No.

1731
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,367
They still they stopped their they went through it they told the truth

1732
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:55,487
And everybody on that stand in this is bizarre Robbie's words not mine

1733
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,767
Everybody on that

1734
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
Stand

1735
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
Told the truth except the one

1736
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,655
You know and I think

1737
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
That that that

1738
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Yeah

1739
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
I think about her

1740
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,151
What I find Retro Air Bud

1741
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,479
What I find what I find so

1742
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
Interesting about this

1743
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
Yeah that it is

1744
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
You know like what

1745
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,927
Mark Bankston and we talked

1746
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,951
Couple of days ago

1747
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:31,327
And we were all talking about how we were worried about how the Judgment would go we were worried what the

1748
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,679
The verdict was going to be whether or not he's going to send a messenger or whatever

1749
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,751
By doing this

1750
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,287
The trial itself

1751
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Tumi kind of

1752
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,871
Reinforces just how bad Alex is

1753
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,151
Without

1754
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:50,271
Allowing Alex to poison people's minds with all of the other shed with all the politics

1755
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,807
Texting me emotional bulshit

1756
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,623
All the things that can get them angry and distract them

1757
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,903
Without that

1758
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,463
There is no misinformation

1759
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,815
A reasonable group of people and we know there were Republicans on the jury

1760
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,863
The reasonable group of people will look at

1761
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,655
Get that s*** and go that is a month

1762
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,447
It is

1763
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
By Alex Jones's

1764
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,031
Ability to inject those things

1765
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,615
That we get to where Alex Jones is in trial you know what I'm saying

1766
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:20,735
Kind of got a bad

1767
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:26,111
I don't feel the same two that mean that I was think about while you were

1768
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
Discussing

1769
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:28,927
Is that like

1770
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,999
For each one of these parents

1771
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:38,655
Like there are a hundred a thousand stories that we haven't heard of people were hurt by

1772
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,703
Play these these misinformation

1773
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,239
Things you know whether it's

1774
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,823
Somebody who lost a loved one

1775
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
Cuz they were Tuesday

1776
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Get vaccinated or was

1777
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,919
I'm careful at all with covid

1778
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Yeah there is

1779
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,319
There's so many stories that end up going

1780
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
Never heard

1781
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,647
Yeah and it's great that

1782
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:00,927
That this

1783
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Allows

1784
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
That

1785
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,047
Story to be told in a

1786
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Large setting where it's

1787
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
You know

1788
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
People will hear it

1789
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:15,519
And that judgment that judgment is so huge you know when you talk about setting a precedent

1790
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
The largest

1791
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
Judgment in American history by a factor of 10

1792
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,455
That's it that's a 56-game hitting streak level of

1793
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:27,039
You're not going to break that record for a long long time

1794
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,855
Yeah yeah it's a it really is it

1795
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Sort of like

1796
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,463
Launched it over the you know over-the-wire as

1797
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Hey

1798
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
Pay attention

1799
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,071
You know this is not really a big deal

1800
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,423
And and yeah and you know you're so right I mean the fact that

1801
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
That

1802
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
Politics

1803
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,799
It's not about politics as we

1804
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,335
You know there have been

1805
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,127
People whose lives have been to

1806
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Troy

1807
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:56,223
Buy online disinformation and just abuse

1808
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Yo

1809
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
So many of them and

1810
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
You there on all

1811
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:07,999
Across the political spectrum and for reasons that you know have everything and nothing to do with

1812
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Politics

1813
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:12,095
And I think know the families are saying like this

1814
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
This is

1815
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,167
Dominant this is something that

1816
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,959
Happening this guy is

1817
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:22,591
One of the worst if not be worst actors in This Arena but it's a big arena

1818
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Yeah

1819
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Yes it is

1820
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Yeah

1821
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,735
I think you probably saw.

1822
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,039
Dispute Ubly the biggest

1823
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
During the

1824
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,135
Bureau specially the years right after shooting

1825
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
I'm in

1826
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,463
If you need any

1827
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
Evidence

1828
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,767
That their argument that it

1829
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
Getting worse

1830
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:48,191
Is true that there are so many more and it's now debatable whether Alex is the worst I know I mean

1831
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,495
Baby I think maybe the bigger the biggest

1832
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
Probably thing that

1833
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Alex is really responsible for is

1834
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
Without him

1835
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,919
Demonstrating the popularity

1836
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:01,759
I don't think Tucker could go as far as mask off white nationalist as he is right now

1837
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
Alex hasn't pushed it so a bigger plateau

1838
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Then him

1839
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
Can engage in his behavior

1840
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,583
Yeah it's um yeah I feel sort of frog boil isn't it

1841
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:20,447
We learned recently that that actually that metaphors is not true

1842
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
Sorry

1843
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
I know I know

1844
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,823
But then also access lazy of me

1845
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,383
He's instrumental in the creation of like

1846
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
The Oath Keepers he's

1847
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:36,831
His fingerprints are on the Proud boys so how much of

1848
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,623
An epicenter of

1849
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
Bulshit that

1850
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,207
Infected everything he is it's crazy

1851
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Yeah

1852
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
It's really interesting

1853
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
Talk about this I know before but

1854
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,911
The idea that when he was getting his

1855
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,191
Start there was that

1856
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:52,959
Samsung

1857
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:58,335
He's just a clown he's a goofball he's very theatrical he's fun to watch

1858
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
But at the same time he always had those

1859
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,687
Ties to

1860
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
Soda bar rated

1861
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,759
Extremist

1862
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:10,367
Keepers and I mean his first the first demonstration of

1863
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:15,231
How persuasive he can be with when he raised $90,000 to rebuild the

1864
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,023
Branch Davidian Church

1865
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
After the Waco

1866
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
Yo he was a hero and Jon Ronson has been

1867
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
Wonderful by the way

1868
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,007
Jon Ronson listens to your show a lot

1869
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:33,407
We talked and he was on a podcast with him

1870
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:38,527
A week ago and he was saying you know those guys really have a wonderful understanding then

1871
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,623
Yeah we were talking about how Jon Ronson hero travels with Jones back

1872
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
That really mid-90s

1873
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463
Out west

1874
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,255
And he's revered among

1875
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,815
People who have been in armed standoff

1876
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:53,119
With the federal government

1877
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
So

1878
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:59,007
Yeah and it at all of that sort of blue under-the-radar it was just too cringey

1879
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
You know and numb

1880
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,383
And now we see you know it's not anymore

1881
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,455
And just the damage that it can be done in

1882
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:12,831
That can be done and you wonder like what would have happened I don't know what do you guys think what would have happened

1883
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:16,927
If people had taken Jones more seriously at the very beginning

1884
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
I don't think anything's

1885
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
Because I think people would be

1886
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,375
What quiet

1887
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
Rightly

1888
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Lately I'm sorry

1889
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:35,615
They would have been to marginalize the voices there like take this seriously

1890
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:41,247
Is it in like 2009 there were people within intelligence agencies that were like

1891
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,855
Don't worry about that somebody's Patriot groups that are popping up

1892
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,623
Yeah

1893
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,671
Their warnings and

1894
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,719
I remember the guys name dammit

1895
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,255
But there was a guy who

1896
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Didn't interview about how like

1897
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,607
All this stuff that's happening now

1898
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,959
You could see the kernels of it I wrote a report and it was ignored

1899
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,007
German by any chance

1900
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
I miss you

1901
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
It might

1902
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:10,431
We talked awhile back. Fresh in my memory

1903
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
But yeah

1904
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,271
These kinds of things will probably be the same bike

1905
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
I think the people would be like

1906
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,111
Yeah alright

1907
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
Sure

1908
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,183
You you're you're saying

1909
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,999
That this tiny Fringe thing is for dangerous

1910
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
Please I think

1911
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,143
Problem with what you're describing is that it's not really an answer volquest

1912
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
If

1913
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
Could have

1914
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
Taking him seriously back then

1915
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,031
Is a more interesting question

1916
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,311
Because I think the answer is no

1917
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,591
I think that what he

1918
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
He did was fine today

1919
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,175
Exploit in our society that was there

1920
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,991
You know he found a way to two

1921
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Monetize it in a

1922
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,295
And exploit

1923
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,343
Better than I think a lot of people but

1924
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,415
The fact that it happened is evidence of Wyatt

1925
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,767
Because it was there it wasn't like he invented some

1926
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,559
Brand new thing that

1927
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,119
It's that brought everybody to something it was that

1928
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
There's a crack

1929
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,471
Any just hammered away at it until he got his own space

1930
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,799
Yeah yeah yeah

1931
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,847
I think he benefited from being in the

1932
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Conspiracy space

1933
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,407
And so like

1934
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
Most of the

1935
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:20,831
Criticism of him I noticed this one of the motivating factors behind like taking this show more seriously

1936
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,647
I noticed that most of the criticism about him was like

1937
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
He secretly works for Israel

1938
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,743
You know like who you working for

1939
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
Shadowy Jewish

1940
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,791
Cabal

1941
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Spirit Lake

1942
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,655
Criticisms of him were conspiracies themselves

1943
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,191
And I think

1944
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
Because of that

1945
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Sort of

1946
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,287
Ouroboros of nonsense

1947
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
I think he benefited from that big

1948
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,359
Because there is no real

1949
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
Power today

1950
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,943
Yeah if you always

1951
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,527
Two other people criticizing you for being a

1952
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,647
Secret agent for Israel then you can distract from any legitimate criticism and just

1953
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
Combine those two together

1954
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,327
He says I'm a liar that guy says I work for Israel see all these people are lying about me that kind of thing

1955
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:08,703
So interesting cuz when I called people this was years ago when I first started working on this

1956
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
For the book

1957
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:15,360
I called people who had you know been associated with him in those early days

1958
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,920
A shocking number of them

1959
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
You know

1960
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:23,040
He used to be more edges Semitic many years now and I'm really mad about

1961
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,088
Yeah

1962
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
I was just like what

1963
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,416
Yeah out of all the possible

1964
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
Critiques that's not

1965
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,488
That I didn't see that one coming

1966
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,768
No

1967
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:38,144
And I also think he's played

1968
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
What did you say

1969
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,496
Speak against Israel more that is probably

1970
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,288
Play true or not

1971
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Please

1972
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,872
Netanyahu's the fascists

1973
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,944
It kind of still a fan of Israel so

1974
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,016
I don't even know really if I know his position

1975
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Well

1976
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,856
What is this has been a lot of fun

1977
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
Broke van Maybe

1978
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
No relatives

1979
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,256
It's fun talking to you but also this

1980
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
Conversation than this

1981
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,072
This topic is

1982
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:10,656
I think what he'd like to say is thank you very much for joining

1983
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:14,752
That is cut part of thank you for having me I love talk

1984
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,312
And before we

1985
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,104
Before we part ways

1986
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
I should say

01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,408
