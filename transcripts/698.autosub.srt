00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
I'll walk out of here tomorrow

101

And you never see me again

102
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
That's really what I want to do

103
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
I never want to come back

104
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Apologized

00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
To the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

He's going to be a lot better of trump announces we will leave that to the

109
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,495
Another thought

110
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Let's just

111
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079
Bask in the wonderful Daughters of squats

112
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:15,199
Hi everyone from Project Camelot and I'm here

113
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:20,319
With major Solomon Berg and we're going to be doing what might be

114
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
Considered a groundbreaking interview

115
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
His dealings with

116
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
An awkward l.dre

117
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,607
That is comprised of what we know of as in some cases

118
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
Sasquatch in some cases yetis

119
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
You know him by a lot of name boy

120
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,591
I'm with it I am I am very much waiting

121
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
Dr. Sullivan major Sullivan bergton

122
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Solomon Berg I have to say is one of the more likable people

123
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,559
Come on that's great that's great seem like he's a bit weird

124
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
And I don't believe anything he said but if there's anybody

125
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
Who I've kind of wanted to believe

126
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
I think it's him

127
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
If Sasquatch is talking to somebody

128
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,527
I don't think it's a right up top I don't know if he's f****** with care

129
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
This is a prank

130
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
Alright for sure

131
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Of course

132
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
He's a major

133
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,143
He's also apparently quite an accomplished researcher and anthropology

134
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Ura

135
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
I guess a doctor of a

136
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
Your apology and also a major

137
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967

I have maintained the title major

140
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487

00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Laugh

142
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167

Not a major

149
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015

173
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
My last

Paranormal research

190
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Espu would assume

191
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:21,215
Sure there's a little bit of telepathy or some of this stuff territory

192
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
As Willard later

High School

203
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607

00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Planning on

00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Enlisting anyway

Cabal

219
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
Leaders within the military who were looking to

00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,111
If it's just like you had really good SAT or ACT scores like almost every high school as someone who

226
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,231

He does not get into comp

239
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495

304
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
Obviously this entity was

305
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
The Squatch

306
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Captured

307
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
An entity

308
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
In

309
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
The Pacific

310
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Quest

311
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Outside of Seattle

312
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
This is the being

313
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Bad

314
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
I prefer to as squats

315
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
Do you want me to clarify the

316
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Determine squat

317
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Watch is

318
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Human

319
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Oxidation

320
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Oven noise

321
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
That these creatures make when they're very young

322
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Human

323
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Individual names like we do they have

324
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Title system

325
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
So you earned your

326
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
In their society

327
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
And

328
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Before they earn their

329
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Title The Young Ones

330
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Are just called Squad

331
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,471
This doesn't make any sense this is like really maybe my only motive

332
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
Contention with this guy because

333
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Watchasort for Sasquatch

334
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
That comes from the Salish language

335
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
The word Sasquatch

336
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
Which means Wilder Harry banned in their language

337
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,391
Actually teach us the word for today

338
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,375
It's a good swing I like it any good imagine if it was actually sas-squad

339
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:18,495
She like SAS was his title he's still administering of servant to the squad

340
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Community

341
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
So he's a Sasquatch and then there's obviously other ambassadors of special ambassador

342
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
He's a cultural advisor I think this is all coming

343
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Going together

344
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
So we got

345
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:37,183
Squatch communication with

346
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
It's out there

347
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,095
That's a young one

348
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
So we got another one that we hear about here

349
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
One of the elders

350
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
Of the species that I have never had any direct contact

351
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Which I know of

352
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Through the overmind connect

353
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Action that we talked about

354
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Further

355
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
Please is The Wizard of Oz

Very very old male

358
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Squatch

359
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
His hair has completely gray

360
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
He's been a recluse

361
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
For hundreds of years

362
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,191
These are very long-lived creatures

363
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Adolescence last about 200 years

364
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,311
They're adults

365
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Be as much as a millennial

366
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
This is Wizard of Washington is

367
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,247
Super lucky that it went gray instead of having squat pattern baldness

368
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623

I love it

370
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,815
I don't know I think this might be overload I think I might

371
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Explode in my brain from having

372
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Too much fun dad

373
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,239
It's a delightful story he tells

374
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
Normally live where I live now

375
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,175
I am going to cry

376
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
Keep your tears because we have

377
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
I'm here somewhere

378
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
But I don't know if he can talk to giraffes

379
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
Because I don't know how to classify a giraffe

380
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
Technically he actually has a distinction of the kingdom phylum

381
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Alright

382
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,591
So at a certain point the military brought you in because you have

383
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
Some unique ability

384
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
Screen with those abilities are

385
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Yes so

386
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
I am

387
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Kind of sensitive

388
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
I have developed

389
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Secular

390
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Telepathy

391
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Communication

392
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Which is a

393
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Effective

394
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Between human beings

395
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
And other play

396
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Placental mammals

397
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
That have

398
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Membrane structure

399
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Call dacor

400
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Corpus callosum

401
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
So if a giraffe does

402
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,639
Then you can telepathically to a giraffe

403
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
What

404
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Is

405
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
See this is why we need to interview

406
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:15,391
Because Carrie has to handle the easiest question in the world

407
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,768
What's the funniest thing animal is ever said to you immediately immediately

408
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,632
Man we're going to get some jokes later

409
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,312
But not from animal squatches sense of humor. That's for sure

410
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,432
The scotch is practicing his tight 5 is that okay

411
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
That's great I like it

412
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
It's basically those

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,880
Turkey commercial

414
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
Yeah that's what that's what do you think

415
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
I feel like that's racist

416
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Beef jerky is canceled

417
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,496
You were confused at least you made a little noise when the overmind was mention

418
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,848
And I don't know if we have a full clip where he totally explains

419
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
But it's not like a hive mind

420
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
But there is like

421
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Collective

422
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Convection

423
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
That do squashes have in their mind okay

424
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,088
And he was able to tap into this over Mayan

425
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
The overmind I referred

426
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
4

427
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Was

428
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
Something I discovered early

429
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
And my communication Squad

430
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,168
The overmind is a kind of

431
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Collective consciousness

432
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
And it is

433
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
It's a hive

434
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
They retain their individuality

435
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
But there is a sort of

436
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Communal

437
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Web of

438
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
I would describe it as

439
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
It's

440
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Very comforting

441
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
Antique prints

442
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
From

443
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
What most humans experience in our very hyper individualize

444
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
World

445
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
So he individually experience

446
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Personally experience

447
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
The squad

448
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
I don't know what that would be like to be

449
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,344
Do wild horse watches

450
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
His brains they have a

451
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
Parts that are more empathetic as opposed to ours where the more language centers you know there's a much much bigger comparative

452
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,656
Oh s***

453
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Well you should do some research into that like I will like

454
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,384
What are the things that's kind of challenging about this is This Guy's real name

455
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah that does sound right because he did say that he used to have a civilian life

456
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
Assume that this is a taken name

457
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Codename some sort

458
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,184
Which makes it difficult to pin down some of the things that

459
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
Can you sing like

460
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,536
In this next clip he talks about how he tried to publish papers

461
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,656
I would love to get my hands but I don't know what tool

462
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,472
Look for Briscoe pit name probably isn't

463
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Where would you begin

464
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
I tried

465
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Published papers

466
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
About

467
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,664
Communication I was able to achieve

468
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
And

469
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
I believe I used the word laughing stock

470
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
Talk with you in our our

471
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Phone call

472
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
So

473
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
They have another name

474
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
For me

475
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
Doctor Dolittle

476
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Well yeah so

477
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
It's raining

478
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Either we're talking about

479
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
I'm trying to get

480
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Good research

481
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,192
Probably because of the subject matter

482
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
None of my peers who are response

483
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
The peer-review

484
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,104
Are willing to take him seriously so I couldn't get it

485
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
Published

486
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,688
If there was research that showed

487
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
Some ability to talk to animals

488
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
There would not be like

489
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
People not taking it to your gallery

490
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
Yeah I know people would go ape shitt

491
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Yeah

492
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:06,816
Kidding me if something was found it would make it through.

493
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Able to be tested

494
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
Do you like listen

495
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
This is crazy

496
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
I admit

497
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:17,312
It's crazy but this is a testable hypothesis so f****** let's do it

498
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:21,920
You shouldn't be too offended people call you Doctor Dolittle now that's fine

499
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:27,552
Pop culture reference

500
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,600
Sino doctor Dolittle's the good guy

501
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Just wanted to call you Norbit

502
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
Yeah that's a bad

503
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,536
Hercules

504
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
Dave

505
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
Meet Dave

506
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,264
Pluto Nash the one I was thinking of yeah that's cool you know it'll be called and I have a lot of lot of bad

507
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Names and that's a Louvre

508
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,128
We need to talk a little bit about going tomorrow

509
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,528
And I would say that there's not a lot of details about his trip tomorrow

510
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
I want to know more about it

511
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
It was a year of his life

512
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,904
Now you went to Mars

513
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
Before you got involved in the whole sort of

514
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Planet racist

515
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,816
Expect at least as far as the squad

516
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Yes

517
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
I know my audience

518
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,216
It would be particularly interested in that so we can just start off

519
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Get that

520
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Out of the way so that we can do

521
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
A bit more into your

522
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Current

523
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Situation

524
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
Describe how you got it

525
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
Going to go to Mars and then what you did there and Sons

526
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
This goes back

527
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
So you 2010's this was asked

528
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Sure

529
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,816
My service as a liaison

530
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,656
Is the Middle East so I returned to the states

531
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:47,936
And

532
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
I was contact

533
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Did Again by Owl

534
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
A towel set

535
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Deposition

536
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
That was off work

537
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,456
That might interest me now I had already

538
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
So when I was 18 and I was in.

539
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Black Reagan

540
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Then show me the rods

541
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,440
So I was aware

542
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
The krays

543
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
Well I did tunics to I knew about Grace

544
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
Say I knew everything

545
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
But I had a bass

546
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
Gadabout

547
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Bx10

548
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Ugh

549
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,664
The US government and Military

550
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
Involvement with

551
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
And

552
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
It was

553
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
During my service in the Middle East

554
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
That I learned

555
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
The greys were essential

556
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Mercy

557
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,680
Yeah

558
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
I'm going to be honest with you

559
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,800
I told you about my brakes

560
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Watching For All Mankind

561
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,688
I want to go to space so bad I just dream of it like the idea

562
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,992
Knowing that the Earth is absolutely

563
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
Tiny in relativity and yet actually being able to

564
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,392
See it

565
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
How could you be like

566
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah I think

567
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Graser mercenaries if you work tomorrow

568
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Yeah and I'm like

569
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,936
Experience of being on the ship it's like I was asleep the whole time or like

570
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
How long did it take

571
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,104
He totally cryo something you knows best deal on the details

572
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,176
That's kind of fine I guess I would like to know more

573
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,248
But I mean I wouldn't believe it if there were detailed or not so

574
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
It's not really the push

575
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,928
Right in movies it's always either the travel is just completely cut out and you cut from one location to the other

576
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,464
The whole movie

577
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,792
So I feel like we're in the cut for the most

578
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
Was later brief

579
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
And told about

580
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Chins

581
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
To Interstellar fact

582
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
The guardian

583
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Alliance

584
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,896
And the luciferian

585
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Alliance

586
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,016
I believe that the luciferian alliance

587
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Centers

588
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Around Draco Empire

589
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,464
And the guardian Alliance centers around

590
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,488
The pleiadian

591
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
So

592
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Wanted to

593
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
Paolo Conte

594
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Goodnight

595
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,080
She was kind of reminding me that we have a

596
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Grandeur Duty

597
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
You know in the universe

598
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
As

599
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
A planet that is

600
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,296
This ongoing struggle

601
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Between lightning

602
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Darkness

603
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
So

604
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
I

605
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Position

606
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
I travelled on board one of black

607
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Break-ins Shep's

608
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
2 Mars 2000

609
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,424
Big one small one

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
30 people 50 gear

611
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
On the Martian surface

612
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
How I was

613
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,128
Baste an underground compound

614
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,152
Underground

615
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
And the recall

616
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,968
Sintonia

617
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:18,112
It's some parts of Mars you don't need a suit for insomnia

618
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
I feel like we got more of the Y

619
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,024
Yeah he answered some of the why he went responsibility

620
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
Still just don't feel like I know much about the

621
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
You know they had to change their name to the guardian Alliance cuz the former name used to be offensive to in

622
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Sure

623
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,360
So these are the people that we know about already

624
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
Please Alliance

625
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:46,016
The Draco are the evil one right and the Pleiadians are the Guardian Life

626
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,416
So we already we already kind of know the players involved I mean I feel like if

627
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,816
We were to get into specifics between the two of them and their ideas of what the specifics are between

628
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
I think we might have some disc

629
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,192
Disagreement over what's going on

630
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
Tamar's to be an archaeology

631
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,104
Even studying some archaeological sites and like sites of

632
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
The battles that happened in the past

633
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,528
Because this is why I started to get like

634
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,880
This might be an elaborate Rowlett

635
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
Well you'll probably see

636
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
My

637
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,768
Research assistant was with Matt

638
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
What time

639
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
His name is Daniel Jordan he's a

640
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,400
Master sergeant

641
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
Daniel Jordan

642
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,776
Jordan and I

643
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
Combee area

644
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
4 degree

645
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Which had been left

646
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,688
By ancient Martian Sol

647
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm not indicating Martian as

648
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Species

649
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
Weird

650
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:58,208
Talking about Martian Nationals this was

651
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,024
In an ancient vampire

652
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
Square Mars

653
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,632
Was a very Cosmopolitan multi

654
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,912
Cultural world

655
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
And so

656
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,496
Many of the

657
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Martian soldiers armor

658
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Referring to were in

659
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Fact human beings

660
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
They were transferred

661
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
Cremation Earth which was

662
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
What time

663
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
Kingdoms like Atlantis

664
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Sure

665
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
Weird feel like now we have to comb through our own Cadillac to see if there are references that he made threat arrest of it

666
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:45,312
We're too dumb to miss like I'm sure I don't I don't know I don't think so I think it's

667
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,408
Probably a coincidence but I was like

668
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
That is just

669
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,552
Unfair you know we've made the joke before but you actually are a witch and I'm going to burn you at the

670
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:02,976
I don't want to I don't want to take out the couch I totally understand

671
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
Solomon Berg

672
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:12,192
Found something he was able to actually smuggle back to Earth

673
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
Excite

674
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
There was one artifact

675
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,592
I was able to

676
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Smuggle home

677
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
It was a stone

678
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,040
That appears to have been carved

679
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,600
Buy a Teenage Human

680
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
Conscripts

681
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,416
In the army of Mars

682
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Used

683
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
To smoke a martian cyclic

684
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
Herb and then discarded

685
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Back of it

686
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
Ends before the senior

687
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,568
Artifacts I was looking at it wasn't

688
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
I suppose that you would imagine is like

689
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,992
Ancient power generators are sentient computers and

690
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
You know none of that none of that blasted

691
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
It was it was just

692
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Bear basic

693
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,488
He found a martian Hash Pipe

694
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,536
This is an

695
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,424
Listen I know it's too late but this is what Tammy future Martian conscripts

696
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,384
But if you smoked then you'll want to go home to be here

697
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,944
How did this toad get here

698
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
So you you said that I what is this Pompeii because you like the library

699
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
Have to be that everybody is Frozen in play 100% Terry has a similar concern about the story

700
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
Know when you

701
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Monument Academy

702
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,608
Scription like that where you say

703
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
He was a conscript

704
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,192
Pretend

705
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,288
How can you know this where you working with remote viewers

706
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Are you yourself

707
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Seeing it as a remote viewer

708
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,944
We did work with remote viewers on Mars

709
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Contingent

710
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
They were able to

711
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
Visual

712
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Fractions

713
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,904
We analyzed

714
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,976
Stop since the residue that was found in the pipe

715
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Daniel Jordan hats

716
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,304
We spoke some of that

717
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,192
He werewolf forecast on map

718
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:25,568
Why would anybody do that

719
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,456
We found this resin on an ancient Martian pipe

720
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,528
Daniel Jordan's going to do a trip report

721
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,696
The high was a little bit Speedy ladies gentlemen

722
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
But this is one small smoke for me

723
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Claire's

724
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,728
What certainly won't kill you

725
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
I mean it really would have been a lot cooler if he was just like you know Olympus Mons erupted and then there was a pump

726
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,944
A you like situation that would be great and it said

727
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Viewers

728
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
What carries Evenflo first reaction is like what did you have remote viewers not like with their archaeological ever

729
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Evidence

730
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
Did this remote viewers and Rhythm Hit

731
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
So there's a bomb shelter

732
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:29,312
No. We're done talking about this but there is a joke about where

733
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
Lindbergh is right now

734
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,408
Now is she aware that you're going Pub

735
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,480
Daniel Jordan

736
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Understand

737
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
You're still in in

738
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
You're still working with him is what you're saying

739
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
You still part of

740
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Project black Reagan

741
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
What happened was fast

742
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Forward

743
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
2018

744
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
When

745
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
The issue with the Sass

746
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,960
Squad Squad Squad came up

747
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Me too buddy

748
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Me too

749
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
That's

750
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
When projects black

751
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
Can't use rail with my team

752
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
Okay

753
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,512
Okay now we've kind of made a big jump

754
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
Bracken

755
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,544
Yeah they went rogue

756
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,408
Is a real place to be with the squad

757
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
Israeli government so now they're hiding out in the bunker 80 clicks outside

758
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:50,208
Tel Aviv Israeli government has to keep squash Under Wraps otherwise people might stop believing in the

759
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
I'm I'm telling you once you see a squat you know that God is real

760
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,656
Sasquatch opens Minds much like toad

761
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Quite a job

762
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:07,360
Terry wants to reel him back a little bit before we get into talking about how you quack snap somebody

763
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
Cherries like wait a second

764
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:14,272
Okay we got to go back to this like war on Mars stuff all little bit reason

765
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
But here's one of them

766
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
You know we can't I sleep

767
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
1

768
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Actor Buck from

769
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Deciphering glyph

770
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
We have been able to glean some details

771
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
We know that

772
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
There was a Providence Human

773
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
On Mars

774
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
That was under the leadership

775
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Individual

776
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Special X

777
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Human

778
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Anunnaki

779
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Dihybrid

780
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
Crystalyx

781
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Ascended

782
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
To the top leadership position

783
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
Mars

784
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
And

785
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
Keystroke resentment

786
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
Between

787
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Two other non-human species both

788
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Which claimed

789
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
To be indigenous tomorrow

790
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
Probably neither of them all

791
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
One of them was a

792
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Trog

793
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Sure

794
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Which what what are

795
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,904
Like I don't know

796
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,280
Draw me one of those glyphs Yuri you said you started them you speak the language you got remote viewers you got

797
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Ancient texts

798
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,192
But I do I do think that it's pretty

799
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,800
It's interesting that the way that this guy is presenting this ancient site

800
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,664
Is that there was a person who painted two groups against each other

801
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
In in there is it there's a sense

802
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
Of him recognizing that that is a bad thing

803
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
To do

804
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
And I think that that's

805
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,088
That's important

806
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
I mean

807
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Here's

808
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,416
When when we see the

809
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
These types of

810
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Like

811
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
Transposition

812
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,096
If you might you know like these ideas of the how people react

813
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Walking to the situation

814
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
Currently transposed onto aliens doing an MLA

815
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Process that information right

816
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,544
This has a different type of self-awareness

817
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
Let's do it then what we have

818
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Seen before

819
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Yeah it's what I feel from what we're listening

820
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
But also I think that if

821
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,992
If you're doing that kind of

822
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,112
Almost met a reading of the stuff that's being discussed

823
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
Oftentimes the

824
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,792
The actual conversation that's happening on that other level that metaphorical level is like really f***** up

825
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:39,680
He's actually talking about her

826
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
If it is metaphorical

827
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,800
There is a very positive message behind it

828
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
For the most part

829
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
I mean he's basically describing some sort of I don't know populist leader that comes to power

830
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
Susan uses a imaginary conflict to stoke resentment and then groups

831
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,488
I being a boy that just seems like I've never heard that before crazy

832
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
So you might be asking yourself

833
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,096
How does guys start out talking

834
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
The animals

835
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
How did that work

836
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
It is

837
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,800
One of the tests in high school no

838
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
I'll be honest

839
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
I've done exactly what

840
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
And I have not been successful

841
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,224
In the course of

842
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Developing the

843
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
Techniques

844
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
First start

845
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,392
Experimenting

846
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Conversation

847
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
And

848
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,376
Progressed from there to lab

849
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,496
Detroit asks where I'm at

850
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,312
Dolphins

851
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,407
We discovered there was a hard limit

852
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,431
That we could only

853
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Achieve munication

854
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
Using this technique with

855
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Central mammals No Malice

856
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Stared

857
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Hours

858
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Kangaroos

859
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
Terry quietline

860
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
One of the other things that

861
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,983
Admirable about his world that he's painting is there are rules

862
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,383
Parameters to like what he's talking about

863
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
To do with the corpse

864
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,271
Does callosum there's like telepathic tendrils

865
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,343
In there and if you stimulate them he's able to talk to

866
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
The placental mammals

867
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,887
No it is it is that like any great science fiction

868
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,447
Always has the same basic fundamental

869
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,519
As long as you establish these rules in the beginning

870
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
And do not break them

871
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,895
Then you can do any imaginary bulshit you want to and he has he has

872
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:03,551
Fairly decent rules established tell me that you've tried staring at kangaroos 4 hours and failed

873
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
This show you one

874
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
You won

875
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
The show

876
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:13,535
The only thing that really take issue with so far as I want more details about Mars

877
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,815
Etymology is very much

878
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:20,959
How long have you how do you know that

879
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
How do you know the squash is telling you the truth

880
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:31,455
So in 2017 I was in the military found themselves a squat

881
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,527
And probably 2017

882
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,367
The US Military

883
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Captured

884
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
One of these ants

885
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
He is a young male squats

886
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
What do you call a bath

887
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Hey

888
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,031
He is

889
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,311
Approximately

890
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
300 years old

891
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,479
And that is in squash terms about

892
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551
Like a twenty-two-year-old human

893
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Soyo

894
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,719
I just I love the throwing around to terminology

895
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,535
It's a bachelor scar

896
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,095
I do,

897
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,167
It is always fun whenever you you like

898
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
Hear an actual scientist discuss like AAA

899
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,823
A grouping of animals that they've been studying for 4 years and I'll be like

900
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
Bachelor's of the seal Community are now challenging the dude you know like that kind of thing and then you're just like

901
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,551
Say that about Squatch soap

902
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,951
No squats rolls off the tongue

903
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,719
A good butt

904
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,071
For the future like I do like that

905
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,887
Sasquatch

906
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
Look up flower on his lapel get ready to go to prom or something

907
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,871
What is squatter's rights

908
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,663
Cuz the military had taken

909
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
StayWell

910
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
To use him

911
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Quarryville

912
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Somehow

913
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
They wanted to use them for propaganda

914
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:22,559
So black Kraken have to step in and save that's why

915
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,839
Seem to light

916
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
That

917
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Both of these

918
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,495
Since I mentioned earlier the interstellar factions

919
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
Add an interest

920
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
In

921
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,895
Using the existence of the squash

922
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,967
And its species history

923
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
With both

924
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,783
T.i. Drake Allen played in a

925
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Fires

926
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Propagandistic

927
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
And because of

928
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Government Center

929
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Tration

930
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,535
By Draco

931
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
It was

932
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
A decision we made is Prague

933
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Kragen

934
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
To remove

935
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
The squad

936
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
Trico insolence

937
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
Here

938
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
In the Heights States going to remove that squat

939
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
This this

940
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Makes me think

941
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
Alright

942
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
We're not the only one

943
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
Hook spent an inordinate amount of time

944
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,647
In the Pacific Northwest looking for Sasquatch

945
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:23,743
I think aliens have also been out there looking for The elusive squats

946
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Yes I mean yeah because they want to use a propaganda absolutely understand this correctly

947
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,727
Things will be sort of teased out in this conversation

948
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
The squad

949
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
He's a refugee from

950
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Both

951
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
Draco and

952
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,383
Pleiadian territory

953
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,943
Sweets right right there here

954
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,039
We on other planets do we don't know that for sure

955
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
But they're here and so

956
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Both of those groups want

957
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
To use the existence of these

958
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
Refugees against

959
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
The other

960
00:46:55,743 --> 00:47:01,887
Rights and so the Draco are in charge of the US government I'm so black cracking felt that they need

961
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,423
Did you remove the squash that they could

962
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
Use them against the Pleiades

963
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,567
Right right right

964
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,847
Is under the

965
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Anunnaki

966
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,455
The leader in Israel

967
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,063
Question territory so it's relatively safe in a certain way cuz everybody's trying to get have their own

968
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,415
Israeli government is pretty certain deeply involved

969
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:32,607
Specifically full Draco reptilian half-human more or less

970
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
The nebula space it's a good place to hide

971
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,799
And that's why they went there into an underground bunker 8 years

972
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
It's watch underground we need to have more respect for swatches if not only are they

973
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Evading humans

974
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
Indeed the entire universe

975
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Sure

976
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
This point they're only doing it because of the

977
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
Help of black cracker that is fair

978
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,487
Otherwise they would be found by the US government

979
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,839
Remember anything that happened Tire Blitz

980
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,167
Intergalactic propaganda

981
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Because they displaced

982
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
Beer bisque watches

983
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
I'm trying to figure out

984
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
If

985
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
Finding out that it's watches real

986
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Is worth

987
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
The trade-off of

988
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,199
Discovering it's being used for propaganda

989
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,367
I don't know if it's the psoriatic no matter what

990
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:31,487
What I was saying that like that this kind of meta conversation that you can imagine it

991
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,303
Is happening when you're talking about these aliens mod

992
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
Implications on the real world

993
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,447
This guy

994
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,007
Look at what he's saying metaphorically

995
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,287
It's positive stuff

996
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,895
I mean it's stuff like this cuz you never f****** hear this from any of the other alien weirdos

997
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
On the intergalactic

998
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Descale

999
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
There are

1000
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,647
Two major I would call them alliances or coalition

1001
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
And one

1002
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
Is Central to round light work

1003
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
And the other is centered around

1004
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Domination

1005
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
But within

1006
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,935
The framework

1007
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
Abdullah lightworkers

1008
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
There has still been a history of

1009
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,567
Conflict

1010
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
So

1011
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
When we talk about

1012
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
Radians

1013
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Summer

1014
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
When I

1015
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,783
Engaged

1016
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,575
You know less

1017
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,927
I would say movie with more no more credulous

1018
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
People I have

1019
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,583
Heard Sadie and subscribed in almost exclusively

1020
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,375
Like

1021
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
Heroic

1022
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
Or even religious terms

1023
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
And that

1024
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
I think

1025
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,127
That says more about us than it does about any extra

1026
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,223
I don't think

1027
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:01,599
You can judge an entire species based on its government

1028
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,951
You absolutely do not hear that from anybody else on this

1029
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
It's f****** show for Carrie every uniform they all are the same

1030
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,423
She literally scanners her brain all over the space

1031
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,191
Nope

1032
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:22,591
No she didn't freak out. Hurt anybody physically

1033
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,151
I think

1034
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
It's possible

1035
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,479
Here's a couple thoughts I have

1036
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
First of all

1037
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:34,367
Absolutely dominated you on Project Camelot

1038
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,415
Out of the park no amazing

1039
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Second

1040
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
He seems like he can

1041
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Really spin this

1042
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Pretty well like all of this yarn

1043
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,399
And to carry is got to be looking at this like

1044
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:51,263
He's a lot of information and awareness of a lot of the touchstones of things that are

1045
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
Like in my world's right

1046
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
This guy I could use him

1047
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,479
I could use this guy Mark Richards in my prison and I got to go talk to him know I can get

1048
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,807
Hugh Montezuma from that Israeli bunker

1049
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
We can talk

1050
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,415
And he communicates With Sasquatch Sasquatch can tell him things

1051
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,511
He can get into these watch over my man imagine the information that could be

1052
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,815
Be comic telling you this is

1053
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Almost

1054
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,887
Exactly what if I were f******

1055
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Cooking with Carrie

1056
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
And I'd listen to all of our

1057
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Camelot episodes like

1058
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,799
Over the span of a couple of weeks

1059
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,383
Man that does see this does seem like a formula

1060
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
That makes a lot of sense

1061
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,735
There is there is a

1062
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
Areal

1063
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,319
Is this where an audition

1064
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Basically

1065
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Mikey's

1066
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,135
Killing it

1067
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,999
Fairly soon

1068
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,863
Remind me to eat seems prepared to know what it is she's interested in

1069
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,471
Aware or at least Knows Alot About That World exactly is a lot of words

1070
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
A lot of

1071
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Concept

1072
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,079
But also it's so admirable

1073
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,663
That it does also feel like there's a weaving of

1074
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Empathy

1075
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
Weaving of

1076
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
Decency

1077
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,295
Through this as opposed to a

1078
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,135
Looking at things and such a black-and-white way with aliens

1079
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
The silence

1080
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,743
I mean it's implied review

1081
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
Carrie 2 or fake

1082
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
You know like

1083
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Date with many people

1084
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,887
Call Pleiadians Heroes

1085
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,447
I think it says more about us

1086
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,215
You

1087
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,519
That you reclaim that they're all evil

1088
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,847
I think it's very clear that he's that's a straight-up

1089
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,735
It could be read that way it may not be it depends kind of I guess how much

1090
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:43,135
Awareness he has of all the fairies app

1091
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
But he has behind his

1092
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
Discussion of aliens

1093
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,279
Really.

1094
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,607
I don't think it's necessarily notices

1095
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
Or would notice that too much that I

1096
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,823
Van alien

1097
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
Like mutually contradictory

1098
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
Take refugees

1099
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
The Pleiadians

1100
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,719
Their empire does have but his

1101
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
History of expansion

1102
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
And

1103
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,631
Squatch is feces

1104
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
War refugees

1105
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,727
But they were also refugees in

1106
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,615
So neither neither Empire has been

1107
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Take really good

1108
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
Heroes are

1109
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:52,767
Why isn't westerheide I think this guy is arguing that swatches are the original space juice

1110
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,071
I think that's what I'm going to skip to the next

1111
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,887
Show squat

1112
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,983
Creators create Ian's and Draco with suspicion

1113
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
They were willing to consider you

1114
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Because you were

1115
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,407
Kind of neither on one side or the other

1116
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
So to speak

1117
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Bright Eyes

1118
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
I think squash is comfortable with Jews

1119
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,623
As I think squash sensors are kind of

1120
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,903
Kindred

1121
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
3

1122
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
Dammit

1123
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
You know we are supposed

1124
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,815
In in the universe and so they

1125
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Actually a rogue

1126
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:34,239
Species that became a rope species without a home for many many years

1127
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
Squatch was very comfortable with me

1128
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,175
That makes sense that is exactly right you have

1129
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
You have 100%

1130
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,063
Created the correct there it is to build around this watch absolutely

1131
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:53,951
Dyaspora history

1132
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,583
And Heritage weekend we can connect on that level up being refugees like

1133
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
It's

1134
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,143
Great

1135
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:06,239
I mean it's hard not to take a look at his story and say well the United

1136
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,103
Chase's incredibly anti-semitic along with Germany being incredibly anti-Semitic

1137
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
And then well then

1138
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
Played out the way they did

1139
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Kia

1140
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,855
I also think of another good button would be there's no Heroes it for the squad

1141
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:28,255
Sasquatch that is a little bit.

1142
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
If we're talking about space

1143
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,839
Eastern and Western

1144
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,679
That's not really matter

1145
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,959
Makes me think

1146
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
That it is

1147
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Intended to be

1148
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,311
That seems like a little hat tip

1149
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Do you like this is metaphorical

1150
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,151
This is videos

1151
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:51,807
Or not refugees into the Ukrainian refugees as we speak

1152
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,159
Don't know if I want to go that far Sam convinced

1153
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,719
Bears

1154
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
There is a sense

1155
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,791
But it doesn't make sense if you're talkin about

1156
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,607
What is in space

1157
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,167
We can always fight over authorial intent

1158
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,775
Terms of practical applications this does seem very 121

1159
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,383
Unless unless I guess there's a possibility that like these space people they just talked about like

1160
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,663
The Earth as the West

1161
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:21,247
You know like maybe where the west of the Galaxy

1162
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:26,111
I don't know anyway I get strong metaphorical 5

1163
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
To win over Squad

1164
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
Because of their shared services

1165
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,535
Similarities in Heritage

1166
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,071
And then also

1167
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
I have

1168
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:42,495
Steaua lot to gain squatches trust a lot of it was involving humor

1169
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,079
Now that was really what you know what works

1170
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
In order for squats because swatches

1171
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,687
A Sapient being

1172
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,503
In order for squats to really let me in

1173
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,527
To his mind

1174
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,831
I first had to get to squat

1175
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,391
Humor

1176
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,927
Can I tell you what I did

1177
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
Yes to make squats

1178
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Please

1179
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,559
I wore a gorilla mask

1180
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,887
Okay and I was expecting more

1181
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Yes

1182
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
No laughter

1183
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
As is

1184
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Species

1185
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
What

1186
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Pretty sad

1187
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Gorilla masks

1188
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:26,015
I was hoping for a little bit more out of that but is great too because it's not over selling it

1189
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:30,367
You're right you're right but I mean it it would have been it would have been nice if it was like listen

1190
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
Swatch

1191
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
Let me introduce you to

1192
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:39,583
Jonathan Winters you're going to f****** love this guy he does all the voices come on

1193
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,215
And he's already Charmed One State be a date there we go

1194
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:52,383
I just I find this incredibly Charming but also there's a piece of it that's a little bit weird and that isn't like

1195
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,479
Your first instinct is to put on a gorilla mask when you tried to talk to a Sasquatch

1196
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
That's how do you not think that's

1197
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,599
Seem like you're

1198
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:07,231
Because just this mean that Sasquatch has an edgy sense of humor

1199
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,767
Is he doing Apes

1200
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,351
If that would happen if he Al Jolson in the Squatch

1201
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,911
I was worried about that a little bit

1202
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
I got into swatches heart

1203
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,799
So there's not many female squatches on Earth

1204
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:24,895
Apparently mostly males and as explained

1205
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,455
This is probably just a coincidence based on

1206
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,271
The ship that landed here

1207
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,671
Probably swatches all over the place as refugees scattered

1208
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
Squatch is here mostly men

1209
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Take a piss

1210
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,607
Now that they have an interesting social

1211
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Structure

1212
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
Females are sedentary

1213
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,263
And there are relatively few females on Earth

1214
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,871
This isn't their natural setup this is more

1215
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Just

1216
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,479
Because they're refugees this is who happens to land here

1217
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
So there are about

1218
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,367
40 Adil males to everyone at all female

1219
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,415
So the

1220
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,743
The males are nomadic they roam

1221
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,351
They

1222
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
Beauregard jobs

1223
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,935
Stay

1224
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,871
But how did they land here

1225
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,175
Didn't you say they borrowed a spaceship

1226
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Shipper something

1227
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
Over the years they've

1228
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Acquired many ships

1229
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,343
Alien civilizations

1230
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
So they don't

1231
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
They don't

1232
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
Have their own

1233
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,767
Like indigenous Lee Designs

1234
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Sweet

1235
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,863
They do have a number of advance

1236
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,887
Spacecraft

1237
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
Keep it in using cloak

1238
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
Yes apparently

1239
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,895
Some of the younger squatches are passable is human

1240
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:09,343
They're humanoid and they're only like 7 ft tall for the first few hundred years

1241
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,743
Almost like tall person and you look up and you're like all you play basketball in there a little insulted and then you know they're human and then they want to fix

1242
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
Fix your car

1243
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,143
Jobs

1244
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Do you know like it

1245
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,983
Is there was a squash plant

1246
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,287
Hey whatever if it's wouldn't be the way

1247
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
They necessarily organized Society

1248
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:34,687
And in the same way there's a discussion about how like

1249
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
They don't build any

1250
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:40,063
Anything here but they probably would

1251
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,623
Right all right

1252
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
Are I'm sorry they're more in the woods

1253
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,303
A lot of them are human society

1254
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,631
They live in studio apartment

1255
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,383
Spitballing here do they have a rum Springer

1256
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,455
You know what I'm saying I'll just bring us squat spring

1257
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,807
Like what kind of escape from swatches I wear shoes lacrosse

1258
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Don't want to return to the forest

1259
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Sure

1260
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
But here's the problem

1261
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,927
Was that

1262
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,487
If you're going to go and explore what it's like

1263
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023
To be in human society got to shave

1264
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:27,423
Throwback

1265
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,727
Take a while for spots to throw it all back

1266
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
So obviously there's some grass

1267
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
About how the f*** did you sneak a Sasquatch

1268
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,783
Is there gunfire did you trick somebody

1269
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
You can't really talk

1270
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
How did you

1271
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,367
Escape from the US

1272
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
Where you assisted by

1273
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Other soldiers

1274
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
You know

1275
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,791
This is where we're edging up on

1276
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,095
Fun things I can't directly comment on

1277
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,655
I can say that

1278
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
I

1279
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Committed what

1280
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
To be considered

1281
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Grimes

1282
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
Where

1283
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Now

1284
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Issue

1285
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
With

1286
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,735
Being charged with anything is that

1287
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
Say what

1288
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Newegg knowledge

1289
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
To acknowledge

1290
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,439
That's why she exists good

1291
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,999
So because they

1292
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,815
Can't afford to blow that cover up

1293
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,375
They can actually

1294
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
Proceed with any

1295
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Tradition

1296
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,823
This is why people who are involved in these clandestine things going to say

1297
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,223
There's nothing we can do

1298
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,551
Formally request Israel turnover the Squatch beef

1299
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,367
He's gotta

1300
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:56,767
And as we all know there's no way for anybody it is real to suddenly find out where you are and then murder you

1301
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,607
Doesn't sound like it happens though I want

1302
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
Beastly understand

1303
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
But you can't get into the

1304
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
How do you

1305
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Steelers Squad

1306
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,943
You have to kill at least a couple people right I mean like there's got to be a pretty heavy security

1307
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,735
Throw this out there maybe

1308
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,647
There was a whole group of people who would come to understand and love this watch so there was the entire

1309
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:24,671
Black Kraken

1310
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
Maybe they convinced some of the other people or they could have used telepathy of some sort to convince them to continue helping them but

1311
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
It's entirely possible that

1312
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
Everyone would have come

1313
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
Passionately help for this watch

1314
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
The ships

1315
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,775
Squatch has

1316
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
Maybe that technology exists

1317
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:49,759
Why can't you put it on a little shirt

1318
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:55,391
Cares let's go get out of here walk right out

1319
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:59,999
Able to tell by this point but

1320
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Berg

1321
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
Connection

1322
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Wrist watch

1323
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
Emotional

1324
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
He cares about this

1325
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,471
They don't tell me that they goes any further than that

1326
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,103
No.

1327
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
Poetic as hell

1328
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,199
Looking at Squatch was almost like

1329
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
Looking at a missing link

1330
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
But not just a missing Lincoln

1331
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,391
Connecting us tomorrow

1332
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
Stars

1333
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
And for future

1334
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
The

1335
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
The initial

1336
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
Communication

1337
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Flourished into something

1338
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,567
I described it as emotional

1339
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,455
Developed an affinity

1340
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
4

1341
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
The squad

1342
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
I have come to recognize

1343
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
Traces in myself

1344
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,743
On an order

1345
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
Like a star

1346
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607
So

1347
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
Like the

1348
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
Who played Ian's

1349
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Starseed connections

1350
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:15,775
They have

1351
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Been active

1352
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
In the evolution

1353
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
Of Life on Multi

1354
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
Worlds

1355
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,503
So in an intimate way was

1356
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
Squash

1357
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,183
So in an intimate way was the squad that really does have the ring of a f****** documentary Bhai

1358
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
Richard Attenborough

1359
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
The Squatch

1360
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,071
The squad is a missing link not judge

1361
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,095
To the Past

1362
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:46,495
Stars who are future wildly poetic

1363
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,055
Guys got the good delivery

1364
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:55,455
It'll be heartbroken if we find out later that he's some kind of a real a******

1365
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Very brutal

1366
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,039
That is going to be really brutal cuz this performing

1367
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,087
Is outstanding it really is

1368
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:07,487
So now we have we are all just watched we are all my love

1369
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
Yeah absolutely

1370
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
We learned of a new alien

1371
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:19,007
Animal do you think this alien is similar to a kangaroo cuz that would really be full circle sure

1372
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,079
Be appropriate

1373
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,663
It is not a placental mammal

1374
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,991
I really feel like I've we need an octopus a mollusk type

1375
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
Alien right to far-off

1376
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,087
I've learned

1377
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,671
Very intriguing diverse life

1378
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,511
Forms that would have been represented on Ancient Mars

1379
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,839
Carlton days

1380
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
I'm aware of it

1381
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
Bubble fish

1382
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,495
Like species that lives on gas

1383
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
Right on

1384
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,311
The atmospheres of gas giants

1385
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
And they

1386
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
Are controlled by a benevolent

1387
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
AI

1388
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:03,039
Well it is also said that the Draco are actually controlled by an AI

1389
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,831
But they're stopping at

1390
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Statement

1391
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
You can say that again

1392
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,071
Cute exchange Auto.

1393
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,887
Is winning her over

1394
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
Feel like maybe

1395
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,263
Maybe these people are so easily influence you just have to make up a less

1396
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
Evil

1397
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
Evil space idea

1398
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,431
Annabelle just be like yeah that sounds right it's possible that's it that's the trick

1399
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:36,831
This is so malleable we need to lie to them in the right way and it'll go well it might be a model Ford

1400
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,879
Dealing with you and odds

1401
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
Did you create a

1402
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,719
Conspiracy fun game kind of totally

1403
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,047
But that leads to like positive conclusion

1404
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:52,959
I don't know I don't chase the Squatch metaphorically

1405
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
So remember that

1406
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
In life you can choose to be many things

1407
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Be a bachelor

1408
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Oh yeah

1409
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,479
So Carrie has a quest

1410
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,623
All right so you're coming out and bringing this information out

1411
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
Do you think that

1412
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,951
Maybe you're being used

1413
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
To do that

1414
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:19,839
And then we lose the track of the question I've ever had that doesn't make any sense but okay

1415
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
In your group

1416
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,679
Or even outside your group that has

1417
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,031
Sorted orchestrated this interview in such a way that you can talk

1418
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
About this

1419
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
Which

1420
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
It's been going on for several years

1421
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,247
You know and an end

1422
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
In a certain sense

1423
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,087
You you become or you could

1424
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
Become a kind of a political football

1425
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
If people even acknowledge

1426
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,487
Interviewing your existed

1427
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:52,607
Oh they will be a reason for that

1428
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,447
And one of the reasons that I can see at least at this moment because

1429
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
You know as you know in the greater

1430
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
World scene

1431
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,127
We have this kind of you know dark vs light

1432
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
Drama

1433
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:09,247
Being played out especially in heightened terms within the United

1434
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
And so you know

1435
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
It is an interesting

1436
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,695
We call it playing the alien car

1437
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
Right

1438
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
So

1439
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
More local

1440
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,119
So-called alien species you want to call them they may not like

1441
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
Charmeleon but let's call

1442
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Local alien species

1443
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Because that's what

1444
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
The conventional

1445
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
Person watching as my

1446
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,639
You know you're not going to stay

1447
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
They probably

1448
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,247
And I know that

1449
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Sasquatch

1450
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,087
As an alien species they just

1451
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,463
You know but they also think they're

1452
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,047
Bar between they don't think of them as a whole

1453
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,351
Population

1454
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,399
Coming from another

1455
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
You know coming from

1456
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
Outer space

1457
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,263
Atlantis that they

1458
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,799
You know how to leave

1459
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:11,199
She gets completely sidetracked from her political football question into like

1460
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:15,295
Other people can't conceive of aliens coming from another plane

1461
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,087
I'm sure some fine okay

1462
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
Everyone wants to think that's watches Justin

1463
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Man

1464
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:27,071
You know I feel like this guy's really under selling how important the overmind is in the fact that he was able to tap into it

1465
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,119
Cuz if he can tap into it that would suggest

1466
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,911
Just about anybody could tap into it

1467
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:37,311
I think we could all tappendorf then we're all just watch over by tapping into that right now

1468
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,895
Because that's what the next

1469
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
You might be Daniel Georgia

1470
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:52,415
That is what happened

1471
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
So on this tip

1472
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
What's going on is that

1473
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
Harry

1474
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Is asking

1475
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,119
All right so you can connect

1476
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,935
To the squad shirt over mine

1477
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Can

1478
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Uconnect

1479
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,519
The other people

1480
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,079
Who are telepathic through a canoe

1481
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
Be a conduit through which

1482
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:18,271
What would you ask can you teach me how to access the squash mine

1483
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Well

1484
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
Is it a lot of work

1485
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Power

1486
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,279
Okay now I want to ask you strange question but

1487
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,327
I'm sure you can handle it

1488
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
So you've been in touch

1489
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
With this

1490
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
Overmind of the staff

1491
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Sasquatch

1492
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
And in so doing

1493
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,567
Do you feel that you have therefore

1494
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
You know kind of like you travel

1495
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
In that mindspace

1496
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
So you can

1497
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,527
Conversion that mindspace did you at least commit

1498
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
You know learn things there you said

1499
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,623
About their histories Deborah

1500
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Right

1501
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,439
And I assume

1502
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:02,815
Perhaps you can send and receive signals to individuals within that mindspace

1503
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,399
Squatch can I I've not

1504
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,471
I've been able to do that but that

1505
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
Distantly I'm still learning

1506
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
Alright

1507
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
And

1508
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,359
So that in a certain way

1509
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,967
Let's say I'm talking to you and let's say you're in in telepathy

1510
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,271
Communication with another human

1511
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,575
Not necessarily me but anyone

1512
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
Do your

1513
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,879
Even close to somebody

1514
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,415
And yet your telepathy

1515
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,207
Because once you're telepathic

1516
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:34,815
You know it's sort of a natural inclination to try to be telepathy

1517
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
West

1518
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
Anyone you have an affinity

1519
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,727
So if if you did that

1520
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,287
Would they be able to ban happened

1521
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,847
This overmind

1522
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,127
Through you

1523
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
If possible

1524
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
It's

1525
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
It's one of those situations where they at

1526
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:58,623
You know what they're looking for it is little bit like with the Target in remote viewing

1527
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,183
They have to have a card

1528
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:04,255
So I am I don't understand exactly

1529
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
The big picture of what is being a

1530
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:11,679
I think that's fairly clear

1531
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
But here was with weird

1532
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
I thought

1533
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
For sure

1534
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,079
He was asking is can you get me into the club

1535
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,663
Basically like I am telepathic I'm psychic

1536
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,735
Can I can you vouch for me to get ahold of

1537
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:28,575
Let me over my you connect to it all connects through you right

1538
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,623
She's asking for a conference call

1539
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
But I thought

1540
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
I was wrong

1541
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,047
Cuz this question has a second stage to it okay

1542
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,607
Terry's actually a little bit suspicious

1543
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,423
Alright well what if that

1544
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
What is that

1545
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
You know. Mind

1546
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
Wanted to send a message

1547
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,847
They could send it in.

1548
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,871
I can use you

1549
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,895
As a carrier

1550
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,223
Too bad send it telepathically to other humans

1551
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,783
They could and

1552
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,343
I might not even know that that is what's hap

1553
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,879
Oh s*** I got twice

1554
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,511
Setting this up let's say this interview

1555
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
Isn't it

1556
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,839
Possible that that's what

1557
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,471
Oh my god really possible I don't know

1558
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,775
I have to

1559
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
To admit the pause

1560
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Stability

1561
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Plausible

1562
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
It's

1563
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,479
Works as a

1564
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Hypothesis

1565
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:35,903
So that's some great disassembly right there I love that that is great he was thrown for a loop and then he

1566
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,927
It's like you know what

1567
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:43,327
Let's give it a truck that I love that I don't know if it's an indication of like

1568
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863
Really good improv chops

1569
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,935
Or somebody who actually sincerely believes this or whatever but like

1570
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,007
That that question being prone to you being like

1571
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:57,663
Hey you know what is my baby that is what's happening to me doesn't seem like somebody who's like

1572
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,199
Complete liar

1573
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,759
Like I would like someone who's trying to pull a fast

1574
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
This is at the very least not agree

1575
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,159
Right because he's definitely say

1576
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,183
No yeah

1577
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,255
Definitely not what's happening later

1578
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:18,655
I am not being used as an unwitting conduit for squash to get a message out over your show part of all the

1579
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,239
All of these characters is at least a level of North

1580
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:28,127
Exorcism that has them being within that like Dominator roll

1581
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:34,527
I'm still learning I don't really know how to do that

1582
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:38,879
Humility totally this is an interesting thing

1583
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,671
And if if you can

1584
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
If you can cut contact

1585
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
I'm down

1586
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,047
Sure I'm down for it

1587
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,911
Hi if somebody could get me out of the woods Wisconsin

1588
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,007
These squatters want to be in the woods

1589
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,151
Concerned

1590
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,431
And the reason is

1591
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Because

1592
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
This overmind

1593
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,759
Could be

1594
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Theoretically infiltrator

1595
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,087
Now

1596
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,439
Where that is first concern as well. Where is squat

1597
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Israel

1598
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:20,607
The Anunnaki are they going to turn the overmind evil

1599
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,935
Worried about we got now I am worried

1600
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:30,591
From me thinking it's just like I carry wanting to get the get in there herself

1601
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,895
National Defense

1602
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:38,271
Issue we need to destroy the overmind before the enemy infiltrated

1603
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,831
Okay then let me ask you another question about

1604
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,135
I did ask you off

1605
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,415
As well

1606
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Squad

1607
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
InTouch

1608
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:52,095
Telepathically with Anunnaki and I think you

1609
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
You said no

1610
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
The answer is no

1611
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
But that

1612
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Is

1613
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,383
More bikes choice

1614
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,943
The overmind

1615
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,223
Can't

1616
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Work

1617
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Against

1618
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,295
You are well

1619
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,367
Silvermine cam

1620
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
It can influence you but it's

1621
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,023
Make you or any individual

1622
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
In it

1623
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
Do something against

1624
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
There will

1625
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
Do it

1626
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,935
It's not like the unlock

1627
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:28,959
Can

1628
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
Invade

1629
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,287
The overmind

1630
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,079
They can't they can't

1631
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
Stairway

1632
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
Through it

1633
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,687
They can't prove or set

1634
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,503
Squatmax let the man bikes

1635
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,063
Okay

1636
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
I'm relieved

1637
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
I love this watch

1638
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,231
So far they've got things pretty well figured out question answered

1639
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:58,399
I am no longer worried about Bruno Mars Attacks from the Anunnaki

1640
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,959
Find is is I mean

1641
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
Unbreakable

1642
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,103
He still has some concerns and that one of the big ones

1643
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,151
Of my buddies

1644
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,223
Tell me about all the help that other alien races

1645
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,271
Star giving to us

1646
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,343
There's so many Technologies and Secret

1647
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
The world that the

1648
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,463
The Raptors are giving Mark Richards and what happened

1649
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
But that's not the case with the squad

1650
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Why

1651
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,327
Why isn't the squad helping us

1652
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:33,727
Well the squash is living in peace and harmony with the f****** environment why do you think they're not dropping

1653
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,103
What do you think about helping us they got to work two jobs

1654
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,295
They haven't been able to the humans haven't been able to develop

1655
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Kind of

1656
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:53,183
Species to species our working relationship in which they might

1657
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
Be able to be assisted by

1658
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,255
Stop squat

1659
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,095
We have there

1660
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,935
They're very rare but they do work at

1661
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
There are humans

1662
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,263
Who are

1663
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,799
Aware of what they are

1664
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
They've worked out a little

1665
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,175
Barter systems and trade deals

1666
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
Labor

1667
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
You know

1668
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,855
Is good I actually mean in in a substantial way

1669
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
Such as

1670
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,671
Helping with our space

1671
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,743
You know exploration or things that they might actually

1672
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Know about

1673
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:33,375
Their longevity and also they could be like

1674
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,935
I don't know what Nietzsche human temperature

1675
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,727
So are you know there's lots of

1676
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,031
Interactions that they could

1677
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
Could benefit

1678
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,335
Our world with

1679
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
Also

1680
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,663
Having to do with you know educating

1681
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,711
I don't know the United Nation

1682
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,807
Unfortunately would have conceived. But you know what I mean

1683
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,599
In other words directly

1684
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
They did try

1685
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,255
There there has been times in there

1686
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,047
When they have done that

1687
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,327
With on other

1688
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Finance

1689
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
Michelle the benefit

1690
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
Arc'teryx

1691
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,751
Experience and their their wisdom and then what happened

1692
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,799
With other planets but it always seem to

1693
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,336
Backfire

1694
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
Xenophobia

1695
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
So

1696
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
The

1697
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,296
The hatred against

1698
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
Them

1699
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,112
You know that

1700
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
The fear of them

1701
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,696
There are other nests

1702
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
Being different from

1703
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
Play Danzig difference

1704
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
Greg house

1705
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,608
It was always

1706
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
What's the matter

1707
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
How they contributed

1708
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
2

1709
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,496
The planets where they lived

1710
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,800
On earth now there must be

1711
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,592
Conscious so they're much rarer

1712
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
Alright

1713
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:56,576
Once Bitten Twice Shy is this watch and it's hard not to say that if you're

1714
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:00,928
Answer to that question is just space racism you're dead on

1715
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:08,352
There's racism Q why would they help you you captured and kept him in a f****** at military base

1716
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
No jailbreak taken across the world into a bunker

1717
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,592
Father with the human race you moron

1718
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:24,992
Yeah and they've been burned before which makes sense why you be cautious

1719
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,552
Let you know as more people

1720
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
Squatch is able to trust more people

1721
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,392
You know there may be better

1722
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,464
It's been a recruit in terms of these things that carries asking about

1723
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,304
You're asking too much of the squats right now very strange

1724
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,352
To be in a world

1725
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Where are most of the time

1726
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,472
Aliens are a thinly-veiled ways to attack the Jews

1727
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
And in this Cirque

1728
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
Circumstance

1729
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,664
Aliens are a thinly-veiled way to explain the Jews experience with racism as they've gone through the over history of the world

1730
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,064
You you can take you can take it on that level and then you can also just take it on another level that is

1731
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
These aliens the Squatch is is

1732
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,672
Being used as a

1733
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:11,072
Entry point in a way to understand other ring in a way to understand the experience of people

1734
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,864
Who are unlike you and like

1735
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
Empathy

1736
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Teaching

1737
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
I mean

1738
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,008
Stopwatch

1739
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:23,616
Maybe if we change our attitudes towards the over

1740
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
We will have learned help

1741
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,712
As opposed to you just being like

1742
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,016
Why can't we just capture them and steal their ship

1743
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:35,904
Demand help they're not evil alien

1744
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Right

1745
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
So we don't couple

1746
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:43,328
Clips left in this also is just kind of I feel like this is a good summation of

1747
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,144
The sort of mentality that's being presented here

1748
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:50,496
Is there any questions or statements that you haven't made that you would like

1749
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
How to make on his behalf

1750
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
It's time

1751
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,848
No just that we are both

1752
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
Salisbury gravy

1753
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,688
For the opportunity to present

1754
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,224
Our side of the story

1755
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,040
And hopefully I'm bring a little late

1756
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
A nuance

1757
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,112
Into this hole

1758
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,160
Complex situation with draco's

1759
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Playdium

1760
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
Cuz I think

1761
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,048
You know some of the the reporting I've seen Elsewhere on that

1762
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
Has been Dairy

1763
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,192
One-sided moralistic good and evil and

1764
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,056
I want to go I don't know about you but I'm

1765
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
I like The View.

1766
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
Storytelling II like

1767
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Text Dad

1768
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Edaville

1769
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,576
The antagonist in Star Trek whenever really feeling

1770
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,648
I try to see the world is

1771
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
People maybe

1772
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,256
Antagonist

1773
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,792
To us but

1774
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:49,120
Ultimately we're all sentient beings

1775
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,168
We all just one

1776
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
Life and dignity in

1777
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Freedom

1778
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,496
Yes no

1779
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:58,592
Not even a aliens don't want that

1780
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:06,016
Aliens and you think alike

1781
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:12,416
Oh they're all just uniformly

1782
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:16,000
I really think that it should not have taken us this long

1783
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,072
To get that very simple message out on Project

1784
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,704
Episodes of we thought about project cable at not at one point is somebody good like

1785
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,544
You know there are civilians in all species everywhere just trying to live a good life

1786
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,872
It's very foreign concept 2 episode I've listened to

1787
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
I also I am so

1788
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
I am much like the squad

1789
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
In terms of bird before and I'm so scared of being positive

1790
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:46,976
This is so scary we can't ever have anything nice

1791
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,256
Yeah but he seems like

1792
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:53,632
He's a guest unlike any that I've heard very much on the old Camelot

1793
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,216
Here is maybe possible reason why

1794
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
This last clip

1795
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
Like I don't understand

1796
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
This is

1797
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,384
I will also

1798
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,456
Say that when I was six years old e.t. was my abs

1799
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,224
Absolute favorite

1800
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,272
Movie my grandfather bought me

1801
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
Lchs

1802
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,088
Casaba

1803
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
The one that one

1804
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,136
Light green

1805
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
The garnet

1806
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,744
I must have worn that cassette out watching it

1807
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,024
200 *

1808
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,584
Alright so you already had that

1809
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
You know sort of

1810
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,912
Abilities that your abilities were sort of

1811
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
Really yub

1812
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,496
Became what you became minister

1813
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,776
You already have the ability

1814
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,640
The abilities

1815
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,992
Predominantly

1816
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,552
I would say I have a curious mind and I had a

1817
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,344
Predisposition toward

1818
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
A

1819
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,904
Sizing with

1820
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,184
The other

1821
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,976
Trying to understand

1822
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,816
Beings that were different from me

1823
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:59,680
I was always very fond of animals I was always

1824
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,496
There was active in a lot of

1825
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Peanut

1826
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,800
Massive Justice causes

1827
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,128
You know I've always been

1828
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Passionate

1829
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Advocate

1830
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,504
That's for people

1831
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,320
I joined the military

1832
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,600
Because I wanted

1833
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Be part of something

1834
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Think bigger than me

1835
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
I saw stand

1836
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
Genuinely

1837
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,256
Help people in need

1838
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
I've always sort of

1839
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:32,192
Seen my role here as being of service to others

1840
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
UCare

1841
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,008
You can kind of feel that

1842
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:40,896
Yep you know like dip that kind of comes out in his conception of the alien Universe elderly

1843
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:46,528
There is a helpfulness is a caring there's an

1844
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,088
Progressive

1845
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Justice

1846
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Totally

1847
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,696
Link to it absolutely he comes it this

1848
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,488
From the perspective of

1849
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
Like caring about these aliens

1850
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,888
Where is so many other of these people are like

1851
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,984
Focus seems to be on like weird political intrigue

1852
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,800
Among these alien

1853
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
The relationship he has with battles

1854
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,432
Spacebattles is that he went

1855
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,992
To Mars and found a pipe

1856
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:20,320
But some Soldier thrown out years and years and years ago

1857
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:23,136
And honestly that's a very exciting thing

1858
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:29,792
She is trying to learn from the aftermath

1859
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,864
Civil War as opposed to being involved in it like

1860
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,400
Like Mark Richards

1861
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,192
Flying Minerva through

1862
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:42,592
They care like that Forrest Gump in his way through the goddamn spaceworld the act like you've got the Millennium Falcon

1863
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,872
Text battle

1864
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
Yeah and I

1865
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,712
He's like a really fun today

1866
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,760
Fundamental difference about Lake

1867
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,064
How you relate to the topics

1868
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
But you're talking about

1869
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,624
It is it is funny

1870
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Because

1871
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,184
There is a like a current

1872
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:03,072
Movement among historians to like re-evaluate a lot of these narratives that we've been

1873
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:07,168
Constantly hitting and whether or not any of this b******* actually even makes any f****** sense

1874
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:11,008
That was written a few hundred years ago by white men with a lot of

1875
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Ax

1876
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
Sister grind

1877
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,408
Right it seems like this is such a very similar idea of reimagining space

1878
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,736
History it's not white male-dominated

1879
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:29,440
It's just that's what it is it doesn't it doesn't paint the Pleiadians of the absolute Heroes

1880
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,768
Like sure they're lightworkers and maybe they're the good guys

1881
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
Per se

1882
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,352
But they're still expansionist

1883
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,168
Displaced the the

1884
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:43,520
Porter

1885
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:55,552
That might be my next tattoo

1886
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,088
Birthday

1887
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:03,232
God there's something really refreshing about this and I wanted to

1888
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Cleanse of pallets of

1889
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:10,912
Things

1890
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:17,312
Listen to enjoy.

1891
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
About Squad

1892
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
What a fantastic

1893
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,176
Journey that was

1894
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Crate

1895
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,784
Yeah I better not be a piece of s***

1896
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
Jeremy

1897
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,112
Please please just don't let us have one

1898
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,976
Where in end if you are just run away ever erase your name from the internet and

1899
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:38,304
This let us all believe in the good news is like

1900
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
He seems open to like coming back

1901
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,400
And carry obviously have him back

1902
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:45,472
So we could have a new Mark Richards on our hands a positive influence

1903
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,240
Fantastic

1904
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:51,360
Here's the other thing that I think is really strange is like how much can he possibly know about Carrie

1905
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:58,016
Because he's coming in with this like I've always been a passionate defender of like Progressive social causes right

1906
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,088
Justice movement itself like that

1907
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:07,488
Kelly's f****** straight-up qanon & Beyond hundred percent I don't understand how

1908
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,704
Anthony I think it still could be a possibility that it is

1909
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,032
Definitely could be a coincidence but I'll be goddamned if that's not a

1910
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:24,128
F****** big coincidences pretty big sizable

1911
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:32,576
Yes yeah absolutely the prank is disseminating a positive message within the

1912
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:36,672
The world of Gary's alien nonsense so I have no problem

1913
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,464
Platforming this prank

1914
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,888
