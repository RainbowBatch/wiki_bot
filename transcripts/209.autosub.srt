1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Is that like a mythical figure like a bunion

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,648
Folklore

5
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,768
Legends

6
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
Long after he's dead. It'll be like homeric tradition

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
Telling

8
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
We talked about a minute

9
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,504
The Weeknd

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Show's over it

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,048
Lakeshore went all out

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
People got together and decided to tolerate

13
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Something

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
Is it is a delightful

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,288
That's all too often the case that light shows

16
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Confused

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
I mention that specifically for one reason

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
On this weekend

19
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,112
Is episode's coming out on Monday and unfortunately we're not going to be able to cover a ton of things

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
Alex Jones world

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,440
Hopefully

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Once

23
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
Time is past will be able to cover that

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
First is that in Austin there's a free Alex Jones rally going on refuse unfortunately it is

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,008
Is happening after we recorded so we won't know the aftermath until later

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
On the 2nd is news just broke that PayPal has kicked Alex off

27
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
Precipitate a real blow up

28
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,088
I know not all of his money comes in processed by PayPal

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,160
Cut a chunk out probably

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Not going to be happy about that

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,144
Are terms of Tourism

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Absolutely

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
Now that's a whole different world

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,088
No cuz he's doesn't understand cryptocurrency I don't I don't think it'll come to that

35
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Probably

36
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Money

37
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
I think they still have to

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Hold it up

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Same time

40
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,616
I don't think that's going to affect his multi-level marketing jeunesse money

41
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
Cuz I think

42
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,576
Do you think of these pivoting to

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Until June SS

44
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
They give it back to him

45
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,512
I don't think him being kicked off PayPal is going to affect that new Hustle

46
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
He's got but it will probably cut into Infowars store sales

47
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,936
Knox

48
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
You know

49
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
Everybody's credit information

50
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264

00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Yeah

52
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616

53
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928

I do only want to Daniel's friends in the lions den

61
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
If it's a real shame

62
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
Maybe

63
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
In the fire where that was all that was the whole Miracles now

64
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599

Tertiary character like oh yeah I'm like 10,000 years old

69
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,287
I don't have any powers or anything I'm just

00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335

71
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
Is someone else who's going to put the team and appreciate it very much

72
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319

Would you be able

103
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,519
Oh that's not bad that's close to Babality Mortal Kombat

104
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271
Let me phrase it this

105
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,599
Interview

106
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,023
They're not there a few times Vicky actually get done by anybody interview

107
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
Felt like yeah we had of course Megyn Kelly

108
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Prayer for him to actually sit down with

109
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
This week

110
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
A gentleman by the name of Patrick bet-david

111
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,527
Hyphenated last name

112
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
In a hotel room

113
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
But that's okay

114
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
The smart money goes but you lose

115
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
So we know about this from the last 2002-8

116
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
18 West present-day episode

117
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
Alex mentioned

118
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
When he was talking with Owen Shroyer about their masculinity issues

119
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
Walking into a hotel room to do an interview and how you get it

120
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,711
Oh this is bad

121
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
She looks like s***

122
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,695
Walking around like a super masculine guy he's like

123
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
Reluctant criticize myself for critique

124
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
But Alex is drunk

125
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
Looks like s*** that's good

126
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,751
And I'm a man with a cross eye so I'm not someone who likes

127
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Batik people's eyes

128
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
Cross eye

129
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
His eyes are Autobahn

130
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,711
Sarah's at wondery aspect to his eyes

131
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
That are just like it's not

132
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,391
It's not astigmatism it's not like a cross-ice situation there's just something f*****-up going on with his eyes

133
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
Okay there's a nefarious

134
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
I'm not sure what it is very weird what's going on

135
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
Could be

136
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
Down for a two-hour interview with Bette Davis

137
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
Then maybe the reason that he has this

138
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Meltdown of

139
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
Insecure masculinity happen on air

140
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
It's not because the story why does

141
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
He told it where in he walks around Drake

142
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,255
He was looking like a people

143
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Not doing well at all

144
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
That sounds a little bit more likely insecure Alex

145
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,007
90/42 our interview with this cat

146
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
And he is drunk

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
I'm I'm going to make no bones about that

148
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
He's drunk from the beginning

149
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Okay but I know that

150
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,039
They're drinking

151
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
It's very clear there on camera

152
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,767
Salinger write this interview

153
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:12,351
Like but he can handle his booze

154
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
We're going to be alright alright

155
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,519
That is going to be an Untold Story

156
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
Because Alex spoiler alert

157
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Talked about how he's ready to die

158
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,695
So we're going to walk through the interview talk about how f****** stupid Alex isn't have drunk

159
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
He gets but he wasn't our context drop

160
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Of things to come

161
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Illuminati

162
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
That's very interesting

163
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
New Theory

164
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
When did Biggie die

165
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
95

166
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Who's ready to die mouth

167
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Maybe every 20 years biggie reinvent himself like the resemblance with Bill Hicks

168
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,959
Let's start the interview where Patrick bet-david begins

169
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
By asking Alex

170
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
By giving Alex's credit

171
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
Which normally if you were giving a Galaxy you might say

172
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:34,015
You started infowars.com in the nineties you built it up from

173
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Something you were doing out of your

174
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Your dad's dental office

175
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:42,207
Created a multimillion-dollar Empire pick up Mastiff

176
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Terrell

177
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
New Theory.

178
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
There are a lot of like legitimate credits

179
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,703
You could give him you can't take away the fact that he built this business and

180
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
Something

181
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
I am sure the credits

182
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:05,247
So if you follow the news if you follow media you going to see this place again Alex Jones who is recognized

183
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
It's pretty fair to say you are

184
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,415
The most controversial political figure in America today

185
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
In the world

186
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
The given credit

187
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
You did

188
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
These are this is what makes you relevant

189
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,479
He's only identifying credit that he's being given it all is victimhood

190
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
I just I just wrote down his credit is

191
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,183
This we have today the biggest victim in the world definition is like I'm person

192
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,303
Patrick bet-david nobody is more persecuted

193
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
I mean it's crazy

194
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,935
Took my children away at the borders they put him in a separate detention

195
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Facility and I am

196
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,847
I'm forced to sit here as I'm deported ways that not him

197
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Advisor

198
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Patrick Curran

199
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,135
Wherefore forced to flee during the iran-iraq war

200
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
They lived in a German refugee camp

201
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,511
For two years before their family came to America when Patrick was 12

202
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,351
At which point he enrolled in school and joined the US Army after graduating

203
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,215
In short he live in Counterpoint to all of Alex's narratives about refugees and immigrants

204
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,567
And it's an absolute tragedy and travesty that this doesn't come up at all

205
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
In their interview

206
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Now what

207
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Introduction

208
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Patrick bet-david

209
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
Haha get more into the salon

210
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
This dude interviewing Alex

211
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,231
Well he runs a motivational entrepreneur base

212
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
YouTube channel

213
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,399
Oh so he's also a multi-level marketing scheme

214
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
You didn't say that you didn't answer with an O

215
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Saturday

216
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
Atlanta

217
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
Doesn't work

218
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
You've already you've already sort of figured this one out

219
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,559
Judging solely from the titles of his books might take the Patrick bet-david is a little bit of

220
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Mako oilfield

221
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Tourist books are called impossible the 25 laws for doing the impossible

222
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Love your neighbor

223
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,943
Also his other one is quick drop out and get school the case for thinking twice about college

224
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,039
Either book titles that basically emulates the strategy of clickbait

225
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Set up for article

226
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,927
2009 Patrick bet-david dinner with George Will

227
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Conservative columnist

228
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,095
After which she was inspired to start a website called saving America the date

229
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,239
Restore America's prosperity to the founding principles America exception

230
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
Interesting that in 2009

231
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Bulshit platitude

232
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
But Alex uses today

233
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
After this Patrick launched

234
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
PHP

235
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
People

236
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,671
The company ostensibly offers life insurance annuity settlement

237
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:30,303
Services already escaped

238
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Charity

239
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,143
Princeton article on opportunity lives

240
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Points out that in the six

241
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Here's something founded the company quote

242
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
His company is growing at such a rapid Pace that now has more than 5,500 representatives in 33 States

243
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,199
No no

244
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Not real

245
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,783
That would be a massive success story

246
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
And one of the only website is labeled

247
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
This is where things start getting some interesting overlap with modern-day Alex Jones

248
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
To begin with ph

249
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Agreements be of $150

250
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Dot-dot-dot

251
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Then you come to find out anything

252
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
And things start to become a little bit more info

253
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
You got to have support

254
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
PHP agency supposedly about selling life insurance but in reality what it's about is selling you on the idea of signing other people

255
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
To become life insurance agent

256
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
You make money off of them

257
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
Recruiting other people

258
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
It on Down the Line apparently it's some people but it's such a small part of their sales

259
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
Pitch at all there's

260
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
Hundreds of stories that I've read of people who

261
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
To their seminars

262
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
How old is things work

263
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,439
You big bring people to a ballroom someone gives a speech and then they isolate them and try and convince them to

264
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,743
Becoming a recruiter for that part of us

265
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
So the stories are all basically the same

266
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
I went to help a friend out

267
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
My friends and family also to join

268
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
I didn't do that because it was rude

269
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
I went to buy a puppy

270
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
He hired me

271
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
So that's not

272
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,415
User on Reddit right they only give vague info in the interview

273
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Until I went back to the office

274
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
An hour later to do orientation

275
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Like was very immoral

276
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
But the fries MLM still hadn't entered my mind

277
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,079
When I got to the orientation of my coworker explained the business model in more detail

278
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,735
You make money off money money other people make by recruiting people more people Etc

279
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,551
And also by tricking poor people into buying a shity life

280
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,183
It goes on and on and on the HP appears to be a textbook example of MLM

281
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
And Patrick bet-david

282
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Is the founder of said company

283
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
Here he is interviewing Alex Jones

284
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,447
Before Alex announces on are becoming a middle-level distributor and another MLM call jeunesse

285
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,311
Gamers unite connected but I don't know how like a coincidence

286
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,455
I went to the bank to get an equity loan the other day and now I'm account manager for the Midwest region

287
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Photos of interesting Lee Patrick bet-david is also a David also advises people not

288
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
To go to college

289
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Home

290
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
We're not to buy home because those

291
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:51,775
That might be okay advice wasn't to advocate

292
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Which based upon the business

293
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Has he started up

294
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Even more Surefire route

295
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Towards losing more

296
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
So all that money

297
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
That you are going to put

298
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Colleges

299
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
What if you just

300
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
But give it all to me

301
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Instead and then

302
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
They called

303
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Exact same sword

304
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Classic

305
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Multi-level marketing

306
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
People go in

307
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
You have to

308
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Is that all of it

309
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Well open got to pay the monthly for access

310
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
And then afterwards people signing up

311
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
So I have to have life insurance

312
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,463
One of our provider

313
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
Are there providers

314
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Exactly

315
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
There's

316
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
An ethical business

317
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Model

318
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,191
Is now part of a different one

319
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Exactly models

320
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
This whole world

321
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
Beating all of his

322
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
This is

323
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
This is Casey

324
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
It really all that

325
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Important to cover Alex

326
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Anymore

327
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,623
He's become the most pathetic pile of s***

328
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
And he's not going to leave his audience

329
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
White supremacy

330
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Nazism

331
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Anymore as much as he's going

332
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
To lead them to financial ruin

333
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,399
And like I don't want for them to have to go through that I think that's awful

334
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
But

335
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
What is the weather now what is the only way to stop the rise of nine

336
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,503
How to use a medium distributor

337
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
So this this

338
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Like

339
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,487
This strategy for hate

340
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
Organization

341
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Has always been there

342
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
It's a good one

343
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,375
Yeah when you are filled with hate

344
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
Often hard to discern

345
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,799
Patrick bet-david

346
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
That doesn't come up

347
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
In the energy

348
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
But this is two days before

349
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Our last episode where Alex had the

350
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
The jeunesse guyon

351
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
But made the big amount

352
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,976
This interview was two days before

353
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:25,120
Deal already been up

354
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:29,728
It wasn't remember when he got on his phone

355
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
That was a like a month or so back

356
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Whenever it was everything

357
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,944
Blurry TimeWise on his phone

358
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
And that window was there

359
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
He had like

360
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,624
He had put out there but he really

361
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,928
Fully committed too late night

362
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,632
Interview is happening

363
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,704
With him fully aware that he's about to pimp his audience

364
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
So

365
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
It's weird the headspace

366
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Is very strange

367
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Anyway

368
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
It is equipped to talk more about his victimhood

369
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
I think you might oversell this a little bit

370
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,440
So you've been Facebook Twitter Youtube

371
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,560
Instagram

372
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Over 100 platform

373
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Not attack band you

374
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
We just watched a week ago

375
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,480
Supposedly

376
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
Your YouTube channel has roughly 1.5 billion views

377
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Give or take

378
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
I was just

379
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:59,840
5 billion views total

380
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
If you're 20 YouTube channels

381
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,192
That probably means you're up to

382
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,568
That's not like a coherent model

383
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,152
Well yeah but you have like

384
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
Agonize one

385
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
In order to put out

386
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
How would you even know they were connect

387
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,208
I don't know YouTube

388
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,024
You would think they would have some sort of

389
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
System

390
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,888
Yeah

391
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,728
Are 20 YouTube channels I think that's a red flag in and of itself

392
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
And then beyond like a

393
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
That didn't go to number one

394
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Right after

395
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
He got thrown out

396
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Call

397
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Hyper-inflated much like

398
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,880
Gas prices in 2008/2009

399
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
He's trying to

400
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
Pizza Hut in order to

401
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
Really

402
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
I mean what do you want this sympathy

403
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
He knows that he doesn't deserve it

404
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Alright

405
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,776
Why is this creator of a multi-level marketing

406
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
Doing an interview with that

407
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
Because he has the channel That Gets like

408
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
5000

409
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,688
8000

410
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
10000

411
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,296
Reviews for videos

412
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,904
Absolutely

413
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,744
Probably because the guy who runs gymnastic knows Patrick bet-david

414
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
I assume

415
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
I don't know that's the only explanation.

416
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
Interview

417
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,848
Unless there's something else going on

418
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,736
I looked into his channel and one of the first of all

419
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
And it makes more sense

420
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:07,584
Nobody did used to have flare Financial

421
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
He offer it was like Financial advice

422
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,224
Yeah Ric Flair on that's cool but then the downside

423
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Shapiro on talking about how to clean

424
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Things are awful

425
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,624
Sharks I think Alex could have gotten a request from him and

426
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,928
Gone through and seems like

427
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Bricklayers

428
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Super cool Perez Hilton

429
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,608
Oh wait what's this kid Ben Shapiro on talking s*** about the Clinton

430
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,728
I don't know there's a hundred reasons I can think of possibly why Alex

431
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
To do this

432
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Patrick offer

433
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,664
I don't know I don't know

434
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Also Alex

435
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
You know like he's losing all of his access he's losing

436
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
The ability to get his message out if he has this guy who

437
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
We have a conduit

438
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:11,840
And is related to celebrities in Celebrity

439
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
I could see him being like

440
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Patrick bet-david

441
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Like lives in text

442
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
So it's not like

443
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,944
Fly to Fiji

444
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,280
Clip

445
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
He was

446
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
And how everything is

447
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Fault

448
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
Left-wing

449
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Conspiracy

450
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Against him

451
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,544
Run by none other

452
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
Nothing to Demons

453
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Spawn Hillary

454
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Hillary Clinton

455
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,688
Soros

456
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,672
Hillary Clinton

457
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,280
About a month before she lost 2016

458
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
Figure

459
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Out of context

460
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,760
She went $18 of ads

461
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,344
Real quick on that I tried to find this I couldn't find

462
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Information

463
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
Cheap 88

464
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Million dollars

465
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Anti Alex

466
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,912
Look up Hillary Clinton

467
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
$3000000 in

468
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
The only the only thing

469
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
Hillary Clinton

470
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
Is it in 2000

471
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,688
Referring to the number of

472
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
Primary

473
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,576
Although we weren't able to shatter that highest hardest glass feeling good time

474
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
Thanks to you it's got about 18 million cracks in it

475
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,512
And the light shining through like never before filling and the sure knowledge

476
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
The path will be a little easier next

477
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
Now I can't find any evidence

478
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
She paid $18

479
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Demonize Alex Jones

480
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
Interesting that the only thing

481
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Is this very inspiration

482
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
But you gave

483
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
About the glass ceiling

484
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
3 million of those were illegal

485
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,000
Interesting parallel that Alex is lying about this thing about her

486
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:51,072
And the parallel that you can find with that number

487
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,120
It's something that would also really pissed off

488
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,936
Conflated the number things

489
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Make a mad about Hillary

490
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
Best kind of my work

491
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Theory on it

492
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
Not on how much you

493
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Spend

494
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
How much you spend

495
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,904
Person you are attacking everybody Americans for Prosperity

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,720
$20,000 in attack in Big Bear

497
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Right away

498
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,984
Charger from

499
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,176
One tenth of what they say

500
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
They ran 18 million dollars

501
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,576
YouTube Google and Facebook

502
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
TV

503
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,904
Here's Alex Jones

504
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
He tells Trump what to do

505
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
And me saying something real quick Alex

506
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:01,216
Also played his own versions of trump saying similar things to him

507
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:07,616
Around the same time Trump is listening to us

508
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,200
He gets information to Trump has information

509
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
And the global is still trying to keep that information right

510
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Making the exact same

511
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,488
$2000000

512
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
All helper

513
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,336
The first one

514
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
He's talking about the Google ads

515
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,736
Yeah I kicked off of it

516
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
10 million-dollar

517
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Biggie's over exaggerating

518
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Once again

519
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:53,952
Everything was coming after me they were looking for

520
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
Which wasn't true

521
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
I was like telling trouble to do

522
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Thinking

523
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,808
Are you saying the Trump was making radical statement

524
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
But they wanted

525
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,488
Their own propaganda

526
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
And then

527
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:33,120
Almost two years later it has been one helluva ride. Literally

528
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
Believe their own BS

529
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,264
I am in charge of prompt and I'm giving him every move

530
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
What

531
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Talking about

532
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
No one is saying what he saying there's a

533
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
No nobody's doing what he saying

534
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,352
What are you talkin about this a lot

535
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,888
This is like I

536
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:12,288
I was very well might as well be called

537
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:17,152
The station like he's he's responding to criticisms that no one's making

538
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
He's responding to like

539
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Fake versions of allegation

540
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
He's responding to things

541
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
You think people are doing they're actually what he was doing

542
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,416
It's nonsense he's all over the map

543
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
They kicked me out of the gym

544
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,792
Because I bench press

545
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,864
Too much weight

546
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Woman who lies

547
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
Throw it through the window

548
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,640
Breaking that glass ceiling by the way thank you ladies 18 million cracked window

549
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Look the

550
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
I want it I want to see

551
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Because we kind of

552
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,320
Patrick bet-david

553
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Multi-level marketing

554
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,416
But I want to say that he does

555
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
As good a job of interviewing

556
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Is anybody I've ever

557
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,632
Really a good amount of pushing back against him he has a couple of good point

558
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
And

559
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
I don't want any I don't care

560
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
It's too long

561
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
It's two hours long

562
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,872
People shouldn't subject themselves to that unless they really want to

563
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
But there is a really funny friends

564
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,648
It keeps going throughout it is like Patrick bet-david sort of rolling his eyes and his body language

565
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,512
But there is a lot of that like Alex plunged slouched over kind of drunk

566
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,328
Patrick bet-david looks like what are you talking about

567
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
So there is that but he does

568
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,216
He doesn't just let Alex say a lot of s***

569
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
You kind of woefully

570
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Unprepared

571
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,568
He doesn't have a ton of information

572
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,408
Position where you could have like really

573
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:57,760
He was inspired by George will this is

574
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,368
Laughing along with Ben Shapiro show

575
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,976
Patrick wants to talk a little more about Alex

576
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
Communication

577
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
When the last time you spoke to Trump

578
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Blasphemer

579
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,312
Who are you people

580
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:27,712
Pause water wet

581
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,808
You want to think.

582
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Ever since you've been banned

583
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,000
Have you had a conversation with him since the band or no

584
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:44,352
Conversations

585
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
Now this is important

586
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Alex said

587
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
The campaign

588
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Because he's

589
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,800
The part of his brain that remembers like the narratives

590
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Talk about it still operating

591
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
When he says I talked

592
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
Administration

593
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
He's still operating off that I'm

594
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
Part of this

595
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
He's not

596
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
And I just said listen

597
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
Before the administrator

598
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,608
Tens of thousands of Articles a month

599
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,984
About me

600
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
This is clearly

601
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,712
Musically one person

602
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,856
There's everybody else

603
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
I'm at the supporting

604
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
They picked me because I'm flamboyant

605
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Horrible person

606
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
And then

607
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,568
Now they are going to

608
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
They shut me down

609
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Facebook Twitter

610
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,968
Google

611
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
I predicted

612
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,904
As soon as I was shut down

613
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
It was a domino effect for everybody else so

614
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
That's the plan

615
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
Want him

616
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
To do the center

617
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,216
More like I want

618
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,520
David

619
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,312
Oh

620
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
Come on land

621
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
Everything is okay Alex

622
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Except

623
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:41,856
Enjoy your money honey

624
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,160
Arrogant

625
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
You can have a good life

626
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
Just just stop

627
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Go to bed

628
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,168
Is like what the Nazis

629
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Patrick

630
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,800
Chuy's credit wants to talk a little bit more about that

631
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,128
Keeps calling him a Nazi

632
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
We don't have to deal with other things

633
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
You're saying they just mischaracterize you

634
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,368
Burgerville spread

635
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
Because I was not a

636
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
It's right next

637
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Right

638
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Everybody was fine

639
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
Interesting

640
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
Get Alex gone

641
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,360
I got banned after him I would like

642
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,480
Gavin McInnes paramilitary organization

643
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,552
Of weirdos who punch each other name in cereals

644
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,416
As an initiation ritual lots of public photos

645
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Congressman

646
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,536
So like this thing isn't like

647
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Good

648
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,912
Like that's the band

649
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,240
First they came for the Nazis and I did not care

650
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
Because I didn't

651
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
To kill Jews

652
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,640
Sometime if it were thestate doing it

653
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Different conversation

654
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
What is the difference

655
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,784
Private companies

656
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,880
Kick Alex off and then oh my God in the aftermath the proud boys are gone

657
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,440
Find that track

658
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,024
So now Patrick does a pretty decent follow-up question

659
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
To ask about the idea

660
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Call Dena.

661
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:33,984
Anderson Cooper Nazi in America

662
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,312
And they say Hitman all this other stuff goes up for me

663
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
Happened. For no reason your answer

664
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,416
How much is this Alex

665
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,744
Do you think it's it's self-inflicted by you

666
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,864
Versus pushes hardcore

667
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,704
A lot of people push but there's

668
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,392
Okay but that's not.

669
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
Wasn't DC last week with a run up screen.

670
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:33,120
That's what they say that would specific any major

671
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
Real quick

672
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Music

673
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
We like

674
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Did you have a specific name

675
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
You adopted because

676
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
You do that all the time

677
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
This is great

678
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Sat question

679
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
Party that did that I think it's just fair for everybody

680
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
For both side

681
00:39:54,368 --> 00:40:00,512
And I spoke about that yesterday was my turn to say Pappy

682
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,072
These are concerned

683
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,864
And so we went back and forth

684
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,912
Doritos

685
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
You're a man has your own life

686
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
You say what you say I knew it

687
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:21,504
If I was Jeffrey Dahmer

688
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,928
Before he died last year let's look look

689
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,536
Charlie Manson

690
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,352
They say don't view Alex Jones what is it

691
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,168
Because they build a strawman learning

692
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
They build a straw man

693
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
And then they don't want me to respond

694
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
Infowars.com

695
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Boo

696
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
He's not taking into consideration

697
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,808
Quit smoking

698
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Dahmer

699
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,392
Or Charles Manson is going to be like

700
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Why did you eat

701
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Kill

702
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Sharon Tate why did you do that Sharon Tate

703
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:14,496
Look it's only part of what I said was he has let's go kill Sharon Tate

704
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
But the rest of it was

705
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:22,176
Politically an interview with Charles Manson

706
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Was Charles Manson

707
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,760
Hey is there anything to help with shelter

708
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,528
You don't like

709
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,064
If you were to see me

710
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Is that interview

711
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,976
Eddie would never

712
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:44,448
Wrongly accused

713
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
If you want

714
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,264
Have the media subjects

715
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
To like

716
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,175
Because the question for the things that you said what you've been apart of

717
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Go ahead and subjective

718
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:56,991
I'm sure they would do that

719
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Interview

720
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Be brutal

721
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,791
Terrible job but hardly enough of all of the interviews that we've ever heard with Alex Jones

722
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:15,679
That one question is the best thing that anybody is done you do recognize like that Alex is able

723
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
To deflect from it

724
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Still like a ratchet

725
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
A couple of like if you could

726
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Actually get Alex

727
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
Questions

728
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Drunk and acting like a

729
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Did theirs

730
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,343
F****** can't one of them

731
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Dead Nazi

732
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
You call people Nazis

733
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
All the time what is the difference

734
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
That's very difficult

735
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,911
Give a lot of ideas about

736
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
Why is Tucker

737
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,751
Why

738
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Alex

739
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Even if

740
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
You might be

741
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,663
Alex

742
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
Do you think there's at least

743
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Alex just say

744
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
One little thing

745
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,343
Maybe you did something maybe it's not entirely your fault I'll take any responsibility

746
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Some

747
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,463
Fault my friend is

748
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
Useless road to go down

749
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
But he does have other reasons

750
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
Question

751
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Going to

752
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
Thereafter mean

753
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
Because

754
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
They can track back

755
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
The reboot 1776

756
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,735
Taken

757
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
Suppress

758
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,599
Contracted

759
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
But they believe George Soros

760
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
I'm the first Domino

761
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
This fridge movement

762
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,351
Watch Trump

763
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
Take me out

764
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
Continue

765
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
What you want okay

766
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Content creator

767
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,503
I'm an entrepreneur

768
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:10,111
Hitler

769
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Dominion Hospital Channel

770
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,631
We had Mark Cuban we got Magic Johnson we've got Kevin Hart

771
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Gloria Allred

772
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,663
Smart

773
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
Yeah but it's marked the interviewer

774
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,783
But she works with the CIA

775
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,111
Look at but

776
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,487
Dude

777
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
This is gor

778
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
Did you know his read receipts

779
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
On

780
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
And then he still doesn't answer

781
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,679
Very rude

782
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
That is

783
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Part of something

784
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
It's going to pay off later

785
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
There's something at the end of this episode

786
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Think it's f****** in

787
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
Like

788
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,223
Hitler is a bad guy

789
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
Is the prelude

790
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
2 up

791
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
F*****-up thing at

792
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Episode

793
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,391
Adam teasing a little bit

794
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,439
And then there's also

795
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
We're going

796
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,559
But we have a segment

797
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:30,239
50 clips

798
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
But one of the reasons I love God

799
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
Or a game you and I are going to have to try and figure out where

800
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,271
Where Alex's brain go

801
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,927
I just want to say is that in case anyone gets bogged down the idea Flickr

802
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,511
A lot of these things that are coming up for things that we discussed on podcast

803
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,607
So it's not really for us to be like

804
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,191
Alright Alex you think you're a victim blah blah blah blah blah

805
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
You think everyone calls you a Nazi

806
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,007
Three for no reason

807
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,127
I'm projecting a little bit because I listen

808
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Podcast

809
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,455
I would be interested in learning more and

810
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
Hearing about like water

811
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
And I

812
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
You know I want people to know

813
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Like we said

814
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
A lot of it does

815
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,559
To be Patrick bet-david asking

816
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:30,911
Do you take any sort of personal responsibility for the situation

817
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Can you find yourself

818
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
He tries to reiterate that question

819
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
Here and

820
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
What do you know

821
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,175
And disagree with you who are defending you

822
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,319
I'm trying to ask from you is there any part of it that is self-inflicted

823
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,599
I want a business

824
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
We have flaws

825
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,719
Some of it is self-inflicted some of his Mi Cielo some of its my CMO some of its my

826
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,351
Chief Financial Officer

827
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:04,703
Self inflicted

828
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
What is my schedule

829
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
What is I-70

830
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
Because the mainstream media for jets

831
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,903
Beetle engine

832
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:29,023
Because they've created

833
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,751
Let the record show

834
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
Alex is the one who brings up Sandy Hook

835
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Patrick did not bring up

836
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
My whole

837
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,807
Compendium

838
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,599
25 years

839
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
It wasn't 1% of what I've done

840
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,095
Within a year or two I said no idea

841
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
That's a long

842
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,679
As soon as I said I thought it happen

843
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Ford

844
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
Oh my God

845
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Crazy

846
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
And then they just

847
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
Publix 1080 goes away week set

848
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
Challenges harassing

849
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,759
Are houses

850
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,319
He won't stop

851
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,135
Call house

852
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,023
Here's the debates right I just had up as 5 years ago

853
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
It Won't Stop

854
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,071
Because

855
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
It's like saying

856
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,167
Saddam covid-19

857
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,495
Effusion

858
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Regional complex

859
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
10000 * I'm

860
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,711
Party said that I'm done

861
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,159
It's the papers saying that

862
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
It's not me

863
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
Iraq

864
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:15,519
So they're pulling on the heartstrings. The family but the lawyers party

865
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,431
Control nation-states

866
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,271
Like the brexit everything else and people are waking up yet

867
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
You can't talk to this guy

868
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Because he's so evil me so bad

869
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
There was nothing I got answer

870
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,791
I love that

871
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:46,495
I literally just anything to either way I think he

872
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
Like

873
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,639
You know that the question that was

874
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:57,503
Do you take responsibility

875
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
I kind of disagree

876
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:06,463
The reason that his brain goes directly to Sandy Hook is that him finally being like

877
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
Sandy Hook

878
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,047
This whole thing is my fault

879
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
Really don't understand

880
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,631
Is why it's not going away

881
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,447
No no no no no no

882
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,847
About so much this one going away

883
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
Teacher said something different now

884
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:32,063
You're supposed to let it go that's interesting because I think that's probably true based on his like the entirety of his career

885
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,255
Apologize apologize

886
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,839
Be able to continue sorry

887
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
There is there is something

888
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,079
And he brought up unprompted

889
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,383
That's because that's the only thing that he does

890
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
Except like

891
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,223
Big spiders

892
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,063
The question is

893
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
What is self-inflicted what do

894
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:10,719
Responsibilities for a human in a conversation about Sandy Hook

895
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:15,583
Is the media lying about what I said not what I said

896
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Ad nauseam

897
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,471
Keep f****** literally said I didn't believe it at first but then I saw this

898
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:27,359
Completely synthetic event nothing happened I thought kids died there but it was all fake

899
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,151
He said that on his show

900
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Literally

901
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,199
I meant after that

902
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,247
Head Robert uncle

903
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,319
Pretended to do an investigation of it

904
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,671
It's not like we had some debates initially and then I was

905
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
Happened

906
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
I keep apologizing

907
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
I keep saying I think it happen

908
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,071
And that's the part where there's like a kernel of Truth

909
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,215
Later did say like I think it did happen that's only because it was such a

910
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
What he did was so inexcusable

911
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Which is why he's mad

912
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
He said he was but he's also

913
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
Lying about what the accusations

914
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,623
People are saying that the result of his coverage

915
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Hitler

916
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
To the family

917
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,463
He's being assaulted and harassed

918
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
You're not staying

919
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
He keeps

920
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
8

921
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
Deep Purple

922
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Actuate that

923
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
On a massive level

924
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
And furthermore

925
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
He is incapable of

926
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
Recognizing the difference

927
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,823
Well there's definitely that difference

928
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Between the behavior in the event

929
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,711
So he thinks that people are mad at him about the

930
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,759
Look

931
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:41,599
I said the Sandy Hook was a false flag and I

932
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
Now I can continue calling others

933
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
Cuz it's just the events that you were mad at

934
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,935
The behaviorism

935
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:00,287
A pizza still an issue if you say OKC is a false flag

936
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
That's still a problem

937
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
The point

938
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
Don't see the forest for the

939
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
Patrick

940
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
Alex

941
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
Just clearly unwilling

942
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,415
Not happening David shorts

943
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
I love

944
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:23,839
Nbark there's nothing in that area

945
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
I'm sorry I respect that

946
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,447
He's a man who runs a multi-level Market

947
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,519
The truth from his underling

948
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
Change tactics

949
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
Alex

950
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
The idea of sensationalizing

951
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
Is that approach

952
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,111
Sometimes in the world is the question I'm trying to ask

953
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,463
Sometimes in the world of sales when I work with the people in the world of sales

954
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:56,351
There are people who sell a product in the world

955
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,887
What I'm selling Alex

956
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:06,847
Cool. You have to take you have to take your awareness that he's an MLM Drive

957
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:12,735
It's actually really

958
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,783
To start selling me on his life insurance

959
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,023
But I like trying to get Alex to understand

960
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Alright

961
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Here's what I'm selling Alex

962
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:33,727
4-bedroom 3-bathroom Corner cul-de-sac kids safety good private schools etc etc

963
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
And then I say

964
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,615
Underneath there's a 63% chance that they're spoiled

965
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
And you can be a billionaire

966
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:45,503
Do you ever think Hugo from just selling the idea with already makes a lot of sense

967
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
You're making me think

968
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
Are you going to let me some fictional life and you get yourself in trouble do not do you ever feel like you've done at work

969
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:57,023
In trouble

970
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
Just because

971
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,471
You know what sensationalize yourself

972
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,799
Are you sensationalizing yourself there's a big difference

973
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:15,967
So

974
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:29,791
220

975
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Question public events

976
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
Boo

977
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,079
Boo

978
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
The

979
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,711
Farthest overhead I think a metaphor has ever

980
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
That metaphor was

981
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,111
Cruising at 30,000 ft above where Alex could under

982
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,439
It also so demonstrative why it's useless to

983
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:01,279
Interview a good way to

984
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:07,167
Metaphor

985
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
I know you're trying to tell me this house

986
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,031
The house has merits on its own

987
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
I'm interested in that house

988
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,175
But you're lying to me about the oil underneath it to sell the sold house

989
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:23,807
Do you think you do that ever truth

990
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Also

991
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
One out of every 3 people who eats it

992
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:27,903
Lives forever

993
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:34,559
I just wanted an apple dude I didn't need the can I go on Apple

994
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,751
Alex will not stop talking about Sandy Hook also

995
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
Patrick Henry

996
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Too much he's responding

997
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,871
To what Alex talks about

998
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,943
Fascinating to watch

999
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,759
Because Alex blames everybody but himself

1000
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,527
Situation

1001
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,623
Prozac

1002
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,975
Things to do

1003
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
Anomaly

1004
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,375
Truth

1005
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,527
Tell us what you think

1006
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
I was going to go to happen

1007
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
Share the anomaly

1008
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
Assuming

1009
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,863
Horse

1010
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,727
Cutting off

1011
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,383
1/10 of a billions of what I've done to Sandy Hook

1012
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:00,831
50 more topics

1013
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
Are you saying

1014
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,727
And then the public question

1015
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,287
Apologize

1016
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:24,383
What I question

1017
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
Apologizing always work

1018
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
I mean that's sad

1019
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:41,791
That's me I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings when you likes

1020
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
Find for me to do

1021
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:45,887
Completely destroy your house

1022
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
I'm sorry that you feel bad about

1023
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,727
Basically what he's doing

1024
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
Cowardly.

1025
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,407
Building it up I lying about what you did

1026
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
He's not legally

1027
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,015
Like in Jeopardy about the things he did that are

1028
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Truly

1029
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
But that's because the statute of limitation

1030
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,511
We've gone over right he's lying about that

1031
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,279
Because he knows he's

1032
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Harbor legal

1033
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
Trying to present it as like

1034
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,191
The media lied about what I did and I'm sorry they did that to you

1035
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
When he did that

1036
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
No course you didn't

1037
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
Create the idea that

1038
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Check was fake

1039
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Probably

1040
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Amplified it

1041
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
And that's what he does

1042
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
Original ideas

1043
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
No

1044
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:42,719
What is an MLM middle name now not made him a bunch of money

1045
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
Or other people's ideas

1046
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,143
He stole the Hillary for prison bumper sticker from someone else stole the idea

1047
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
76

1048
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,591
Stolen all of these things in order to co-opt them

1049
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,199
How do I f*** this guy

1050
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,575
What I'm fascinated by listening

1051
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
Is that I hear the backstory

1052
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,695
What's the name of the Doctor Who Lost

1053
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,535
Rebecca Carley

1054
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,071
That backstory of

1055
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
Everything was going great

1056
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Like she was

1057
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
Really really

1058
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Successful

1059
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,983
Became this

1060
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
This moment to broker

1061
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:33,151
You know like this is what I'm hearing with Alex is that somehow everything that he's done was going great and then he

1062
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431
He's broken now until

1063
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,735
As his life continues every conversation

1064
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,575
I'm doing pretty all right but

1065
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
Man

1066
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,231
David Sandy Hook

1067
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:52,095
It's Omaha

1068
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,495
At the bar the Corner Bar is I could have been something I almost I almost made

1069
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,335
The big-league I got it I got it covered

1070
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
I had Tommy John

1071
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,687
Just never came back

1072
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,295
Maybe 1% of those stories you are true and the others are creating a

1073
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:16,927
Hero narrative about why you aren't what you think you should be and you think other people think you should

1074
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,511
Very cold

1075
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
It's ego-driven

1076
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
It's jealousy it

1077
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,399
Lack of responsibility is all those things

1078
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
To a pathetic level

1079
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,751
Patrick wants to

1080
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,311
To discuss the idea of Alex not being able to use social

1081
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,175
The crippled his reach and really hurt his

1082
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,991
So in order to facilitate

1083
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:45,855
Patrick brings up that a couple years ago he lost his voice for 90 days

1084
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,951
Condition like a polyp or something in his throat and he wasn't able to talk

1085
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
And as a sales

1086
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
Incredibly difficult

1087
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,119
Use that as a metaphor for Alex to

1088
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,911
Open up about the idea of

1089
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:02,239
Speech and the ability to get your ideas

1090
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
The cross

1091
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,335
Alex not so interested in that but

1092
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
What's this

1093
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,991
Personal moment that could become a flowering of conversation

1094
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,575
Likes

1095

1115

2 *

1120
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,599
The Patrick response

1121
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
Something nonsensical that Alex says

1122
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,927
You really believe that

1123
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
Which is nice

1124
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
Yeah I mean that is just like

01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Too drunk

1128
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Now I will say

1129
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
I don't know if I can

1130
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,711
If I could ever hear life is fragile and

1131
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,503
Any other syndrome

1132
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
Real quick

1133
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
Which is the best way for it

1134
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:38,911
Miserably through a mouthful of fruit

1135
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Alex

1136
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,799
Kicked off social media so Patrick follows that up I asked

1137
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Do you want to get back home

1138
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,663
Would you ever want to be

1139
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:56,063
You know figure out a way to be letting you know be back on your social media platform if they never ever let you back

1140
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,367
Are you okay with that never again

1141
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,183
I'm Alex I'm never changing

1142
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:07,583
What do you take me back when I am never changing a single why do anything

1143
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Obviously

1144
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,311
Misrepresent everything I said.

1145
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,615
Dorsey went on

1146
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
About to go on

1147
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,551
ABC Auto

1148
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,391
Jones says he wants to kill the media with assault rifles

1149
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
North Chicago

1150
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
Jack Dorsey

1151
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
It's horrible.

1152
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
That's Defender

1153
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
So

1154
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,567
Offended YouTube

1155
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
Confronted

1156
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,639
Marco Rubio

1157
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,175
The Walk of the Prescott

1158
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,735
Jack Dorsey said oh my God

1159
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
Now I can stand him

1160
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,183
Who told you know you soon

1161
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
No

1162
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:12,095
People meeting telling you that now that you're going after Marco Rubio this is an opportunity for the receipt O'Banion

1163
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,143
That were in a meeting with

1164
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,191
Check

1165
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,543
Joe's Auto I can't band

1166
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,103
Alex Jones Republican

1167
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
This is Dad

1168
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,479
Elementary

1169
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,551
Alex I know that I told you before we started recording at this

1170
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:36,415
The content they were covering has the potential to be incredibly sad or incredibly hilarious

1171
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,767
Very

1172
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
Very sad

1173
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Set like

1174
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
You don't

1175
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
That's none

1176
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
You've created

1177
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Constructed a reason why

1178
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,031
People took action against

1179
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
You did

1180
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
XYZ

1181
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
You've decided that the best way to

1182
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,455
Republican cover to attack

1183
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,759
Cuz you already painted all of your enemies

1184
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
Does being left-leaning

1185
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,599
I don't know communist socialist

1186
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,391
Authoritarian so

1187
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,719
Almost be like

1188
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
A part of a

1189
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Training tape

1190
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
How to

1191
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Interrogate Psych

1192
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
Psychopaths

1193
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:18,399
Sure

1194
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,959
Look you think you constructed a great question

1195
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,775
You think that you got something that he's going to have to answer

1196
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
Psychopath

1197
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
No you are just

1198
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,015
There

1199
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
If you if you listen to his answers there's so much

1200
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Green from like

1201
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,207
Psychopath language and how you respond to like humans

1202
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
Just letting him saying like

1203
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,815
Of course I want to be let back on these

1204
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,351
Platform

1205
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Even though you

1206
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,215
Yes I have said many times that if they kick me off that's the right things and I

1207
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:58,847
Only bored.

1208
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
I don't want

1209
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:04,479
I just want them to apologize to me and tell me that I'm right

1210
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Bright

1211
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,855
Psychological thing butts

1212
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
I don't actually begrudge

1213
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Patrick Bernard

1214
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,999
Going too far down that road cuz

1215
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,815
Way out of his depth.

1216
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,887
Detroit

1217
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
Earlier he tried to reframe the question

1218
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
About

1219
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,239
Sensationalism

1220
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Understand

1221
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,311
And now this morning tries to

1222
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
Bring back

1223
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,151
A question he'd already asked why haven't other people

1224
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Why aren't they

1225
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:36,991
Naruto

1226
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
No answer

1227
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,903
I bet used to be the main guy to watch on Fox Amanda Riley we'll go at it

1228
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
And he was coming up and

1229
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,863
He would get up and you would do it show that I was on back one time he would show this up so you don't like

1230
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,215
And Hitler

1231
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
You know and even Rush

1232
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,567
These guys haven't been

1233
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
You've been bad

1234
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,391
Is it because they say

1235
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,999
No I don't think that's the only thing that would cover geopolitical system

1236
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,559
The world government

1237
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,407
I don't care

1238
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Why is BET not effective

1239
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,063
Baked is not a guy that they agree with Liza Limbaugh not offline

1240
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,143
I think it's overselling

1241
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,959
So getting the kids back to the sensationalizing

1242
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:04,543
Explain more about that

1243
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
In later clips

1244
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,687
Milo is back on and I think he's the worst

1245
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
Sitting in the house

1246
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,015
History of the world Alex

1247
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,295
Patrick's wrong about

1248
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,575
Milos

1249
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:22,975
He's actually smilo

1250
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,535
Arella

1251
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,095
The question is asking is one that Alex

1252
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Without

1253
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:34,239
Validated

1254
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,055
These people

1255
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,591
Are not in trouble

1256
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
The only thing you

1257
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,199
You can fall back on his I can take me out so they can eventually take them out

1258
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,783
And when that doesn't happen when people just like

1259
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
It's your actions

1260
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Because this

1261
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,671
That argument falls apart angle here is to be like

1262
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Dancers money

1263
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
I don't make

1264
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,023
The powers-that-be

1265
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,607
Smart who makes who makes money whenever Hannity makes

1266
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,423
I'll tell you what at least one or two globalist

1267
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
Troutdale cuz that argument falls apart with back

1268
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
Cuz he started his own

1269
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
He started the blaze

1270
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,359
But failed

1271
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:16,223
He's not on Fox news or any of those platforms

1272
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Or so like the idea that

1273
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,575
That that argument would even fall apart on further and out

1274
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,255
You have to do some further analysis

1275
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,791
Right

1276
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,399
If you explain answer and not like

1277
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,703
Do not go further with it what you're doing is

1278
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
Just saying like wow the audience

1279
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
I hope they can see through this

1280
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,871
There's nowhere else to really go with it

1281
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,175
You don't want him drunkenly storming out of the

1282
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:52,831
Erin Gallagher

1283
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Is where I think

1284
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Is really getting good Dale

1285
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Zeno's

1286
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,815
You say

1287
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:07,679
Dangerous groups in this country because

1288
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,031
But they still hate everybody because they weren't the jocks in high school

1289
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,615
He's reading and Alex Jones quote

1290
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
Still the conversation is about Alex Sensation

1291
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,575
They use their brains to hurt people and I'm aware of them okay I see

1292
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,343
You little rat

1293
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
How can you say something like that

1294
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:36,607
I remember 3gp

1295
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
So he's become so successful because this

1296
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
You know he's not really somebody

1297
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
You'll take it even deeper

1298
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,559
Going to jump to conclusion

1299
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,911
You're Sensational come on oh my God

1300
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,239
Bill Gates is the Army program on eugenics

1301
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,775
Was ahead of Planned Parenthood

1302
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,847
Reduce world population

1303
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Yeah but

1304
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Alex you take it

1305
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,039
Two points for the media sitting there saying

1306
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
Okay

1307
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,159
Can hear something listen to somebody like

1308
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,975
And you can really mess with a nightmare

1309
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,071
Hiddenite

1310
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,447
Tell me about it

1311
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,543
Okay

1312
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,127
Show that is the main human genome

1313
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
Alright alright

1314
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
The whole deal

1315
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
Remember When

1316
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:00,063
They trained Institute

1317
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,599
They're both surprising books

1318
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
For sure

1319
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:07,487
Alex what is it no I'm not

1320
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
The books

1321
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,863
Alex if you know everything that you say you know

1322
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:15,167
And you Potter plant why are you still alive

1323
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,007
Well they're murdering my name their assassin

1324
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,943
So if you were opposing the most

1325
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Powerpool

1326
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,063
Democrat in the marketplace

1327
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Is so

1328
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
Force

1329
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,767
This is kind of my thing coming to terms with

1330
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,959
He got so much mileage out of people thinking

1331
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,287
The best thing for him

1332
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
He's in the same way like the room

1333
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
You know like

1334
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,943
You can pretend it was a satirical farce or whatever but that's

1335
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
That's real

1336
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:04,575
Purposing their response people had to it in order to pretend I was doing that all along

1337
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,391
Alex is doing the same thing and he will

1338
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
Throughout this

1339
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,743
The idea of what I was using in order to

1340
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,583
Fly under the radar

1341
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
D

1342
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,495
Cold Springs Harbor be covered in our endgame coverage I don't want to go back in

1343
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,823
Go over all that it's

1344
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:31,199
Go back look bad if you want understand 12 hours of our day

1345
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
But like

1346
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
But like

1347
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,719
I don't know dumb

1348
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
I'm throwing out very broad vague

1349
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Things to do

1350
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
I got all this I got all this

1351
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,423
When you have someone like

1352
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Bill Gates

1353
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
Talking about how the population

1354
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
Reduced

1355
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Not talkin about

1356
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,895
He's not talking about putting something to vaccines

1357
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
The kill everyone

1358
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:05,247
He's talking about the holding capacities for resources in various

1359
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
The world

1360
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
How a lot of places

1361
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,087
Hazard overburden

1362
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
Population

1363
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
That

1364
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Arnot

1365
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:19,327
Now the other flip side of that is if you want to have a conversation about like

1366
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:24,191
Treat the rest of the world like there's

1367
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,263
Conversation is much more reasonable and much more

1368
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:36,735
You know the idea that like parts of Africa they could have the amount of children that they

1369
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,111
Hoard all of the money and he didn't have a history of stealing all their resources

1370
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,159
Generation

1371
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
There's a better conversation

1372
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
I have about that

1373
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
Jazz about

1374
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,071
Bill Gates

1375
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,863
Kill off everybody right

1376
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,423
Mosquito drones or whatever the f*** you going

1377
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,519
Asked a question that I sent chaliyan oculator himself

1378
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
From the answer

1379
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Vaccine

1380
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
The question just being like

1381
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,407
You can f****** a naive mine

1382
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
Suggest that you do not have a naive

1383
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,063
Right

1384
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:21,023
Are you taking advantage of stupid people

1385
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:27,679
But that's why Alex has to come back with do you know about Cold Spring Harbor

1386
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
Reasonably assured

1387
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
Did the first News Talk

1388
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
Doesn't know about

1389
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,919
It's the same reason why I quit

1390
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
He was losing an argument about

1391
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:46,367
Chemtrails

1392
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,439
That out because he knows that Eddie Bravo

1393
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,463
Joe Rogan

1394
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,743
Don't know that

1395
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
Exact

1396
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:01,983
Answering questions

1397
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,055
Patrick credit for being like

1398
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Okay

1399
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Now is

1400
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Is where Alex

1401
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Dark

1402
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,063
This is where

1403
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
The interview

1404
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,903
Because I think he recognized

1405
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,207
End it where you point it out do you like

1406
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,767
You're dangerous tonight Eve mine

1407
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
It does lead

1408
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,583
Alex the realized

1409
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
Patrick isn't going

1410
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:33,983
Go along with everything I'm saying he's already shown that maybe he's not

1411
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
And now it's

1412
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,775
Just like

1413
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
Just got to preach

1414
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,335
Until he starts preaching

1415
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
F****** dark

1416
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,919
It was a joke

1417
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:47,039
Like a poison I typed rated

1418
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,111
I thought it was a job that uses against prom

1419
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
They were winning and now

1420
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,695
Poison

1421
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
The truth

1422
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
Is so strong

1423
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,559
When a big dose has the Mary a.

1424
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,631
And so I'm just older on the globalist leave lunch

1425
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
I'm ready to die

1426
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,799
This is all gravy

1427
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Salt

1428
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,639
They are already in the system

1429
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
41

1430
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,223
I thought it was a joke

1431
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
An allergist doctor

1432
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
Information never that guy

1433
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
You think so

1434
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,631
Yeah I know it's true

1435
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,191
Because Humanity want to live

1436
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,543
They're the ones doing this I started their papers

1437
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:43,615
I started the program are you at why they're so afraid

1438
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
You're so afraid

1439
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
Got their number

1440
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
Not afraid to die

1441
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
So that's where you're at

1442
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
If you ever get back on social media

1443
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
I don't

1444
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
You really don't the message

1445
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,279
The transmission

1446
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
Everything else Dallas driving

1447
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:10,239
Earlier you said he wanted to get back on social media

1448
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:20,736
12 quart

1449
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
Rampant

1450
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,840
How many skips does NexGard cuz it's kind of

1451
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,888
Exactly the same as that last one

1452
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,448
He talked about how like I've completed

1453
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,288
My mission

1454
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:51,968
Like the two people who restart the evolutionary process at the end of a movie

1455
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:58,368
They're both

1456
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:05,536
I have a theory about that this is a little bit dark and I apologize for it

1457
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,072
Show reboot

1458
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,632
I think Alex might kill him

1459
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
You think so

1460
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,728
I do

1461
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,848
Besan I don't I'm not saying but I would be surprised if

1462
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
Yeah based on the level of

1463
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,712
Is life is a

1464
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,736
F****** map

1465
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
And not just because of

1466
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
Trump political stuff

1467
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,904
Probably going to be

1468
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,208
Successfully sued by a number of people

1469
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,096
Just like I said we're recording this his Paypal has been taken away his ability to process

1470
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,936
There's a real life is going to win that custody

1471
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,984
I don't know cuz

1472
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,032
We have no reason to know

1473
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,312
What's going on with

1474
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
But let's

1475
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,664
Imagine a scenario where he ends up losing custody of his children

1476
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
PayPal goes away

1477
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
He's not allowed on social media

1478
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,832
Multi-level marketing scheme guy

1479
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,392
Who's just on the outermost fringes

1480
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
I think there's a decent chance that what

1481
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
You doing is largely

1482
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
Laying the groundwork

1483
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:13,120
For him to become the next in the line of people he's talked about

1484
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
On his own show

1485
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,192
People like Andrew Breitbart

1486
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Who Alex

1487
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,008
Lies and says was murdered

1488
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,056
When he had a f****** heart attack cuz yeah

1489
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,360
Already had a heart attack was way out of

1490
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,128
Shape

1491
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
June time to blowout

1492
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
Yeah

1493
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,712
The d.c. Madam

1494
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,016
Who absolutely killed herself

1495
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,576
4 * was murdered

1496
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
By the global

1497
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
All of the people

1498
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:38,464
Using Larry Nichols to backup being arkancide

1499
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,512
Yeah killed by the clintons

1500
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
Gary Webb

1501
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Gooseberry

1502
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
Clearly killed himself

1503
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,632
Who Alex pretends his murder

1504
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
I think that there's a

1505
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,496
Is the propaganda

1506
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
Campaign towards his

1507
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,080
Now at the same time I reckon

1508
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,128
You're such a massive ego

1509
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
And is

1510
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
Not really

1511
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,224
Like the idea of killing yourself

1512
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
The further your own narrative is

1513
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Also kind of

1514
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Evolve self-sacrifice

1515
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
Because you are dead

1516
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,000
So it does kind of

1517
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
If not matching psychology

1518
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,120
He's behaving really really scares me

1519
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,424
It's very troubling on a certain level

1520
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,216
That is a path I could

1521
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,240
Could see this going down

1522
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,056
I mean icm's self-destruct

1523
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,336
Okay

1524
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:38,368
But he knows eventually I'm going to fall down the stairs

1525
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
If anything happens to

1526
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,792
And I fell off a bridge

1527
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:50,400
No matter what happens the globalist

1528
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:58,592
I worry about that I'm not entirely sure if you super irresponsible

1529
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,384
To say like that is what's going to happen

1530
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,920
But I feel shaved

1531
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,968
Pictures of I would never to hurt myself

1532
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
From someone who is

1533
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,320
I hope that's not the case

1534
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,416
Ultimate

1535
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Advice to Alec

1536
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
Texas

1537
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,232
Get some help

1538
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
Talk to somebody

1539
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:23,168
There is help available you're hurting yourself and your kids is not okay

1540
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,960
Despise you for real

1541
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,312
You but your kids don't deserve

1542
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,360
Yeah and I know that

1543
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Personalized or not

1544
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,920
On the table for us

1545
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,712
But he'll be irresponsible

1546
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,248
Before us did not recognize that

1547
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
He was a swinging Bachelor

1548
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
I don't think I would

1549
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
I would not care but his

1550
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:43,648
His actions of

1551
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
People who don't

1552
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
Have any

1553
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:51,328
There are so many people who are the human aftermath

1554
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:58,752
Children

1555
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Real yourself

1556
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,800
Okay well

1557
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:09,504
And all of his children or paramilitary night

1558
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,624
I don't know how Grand it is

1559
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,232
Hey everybody down here

1560
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
But

1561
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
Because there's a

1562
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,864
Little bit of a situation when I was trying to record this episode with Jordan

1563
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,936
There was one clip that didn't upload

1564
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
Into my eyes

1565
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
Tunes where I play all the eclipse from

1566
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,544
Unfortunately we missed

1567
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Normally

1568
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,104
Situation where I would say

1569
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,920
You know that's too bad we missed one

1570
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
No is relevant

1571
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
To talk about

1572
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,784
Unfortunately this clip is actually a

1573
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,576
Good Wife

1574
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,112
The darkness

1575
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,392
Of this album

1576
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
Review

1577
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
And so kind of

1578
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,720
Be incomplete for us

1579
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:51,488
To talk about this

1580
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,256
Episode

1581
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,280
Without

1582
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
Part of it unfortunately I'm

1583
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
Sitting here now adding

1584
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,144
Pizza without Jordan

1585
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,448
And maybe that's for the best actually because I

1586
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Jordan would never stops

1587
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,544
This clip

1588
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
But

1589
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,592
Here it is

1590
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,616
Alex Jones

1591
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,664
About how he his teacher

1592
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
Lick

1593
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
And he needs to

1594
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
Is WIC

1595
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
We're going up again

1596
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,344
Everything else Dallas driving

1597
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Everything else is

1598
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
Just getting ready to make.

1599
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,232
I got to take my legs

1600
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
Is that why you never

1601
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Let's get it going

1602
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,568
Tell me what God forever.

1603
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,968
Chase Edwards

1604
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
Dodgers a system where

1605
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
Everybody's a coward sells out now this

1606
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,648
The people that are dedicated

1607
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
Nachos

1608
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,488
Put themselves alive

1609
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
You got three kids

1610
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
You got pork

1611
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,704
15 year old rights

1612
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Tipitina's

1613
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,520
I got a 16 month old right after

1614
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
60 months old

1615
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,920
Exterminators program is

1616
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,504
Do this thing about Fisher anyway

1617
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,808
And that's deliberate

1618
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
If I don't

1619
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,536
So what is Alex

1620
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Clearly

1621
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
To put his family

1622
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
For the people

1623
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
He has

1624
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
Now

1625
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
I don't know how to talk about

1626
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,176
Other than to say that

1627
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
Incredibly ugly any response

1628
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Terrible parenting

1629
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,040
This is the sort of thing

1630
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
That I think she

1631
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Be played

1632
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Andy's custard

1633
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Hearing speak

1634
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
As you hear

1635
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,672
He's expressing

1636
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,696
That

1637
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
My kids are going to have

1638
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Their lick

1639
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
I don't know

1640
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
I don't know what to say about it

1641
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Jordans

1642
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Absolutely

1643
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,520
Play Furious.

1644
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,800
Anyway back to the show

1645
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,408
But in this next clip Alex

1646
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
Is forced to talk about

1647
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,504
Springs

1648
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
Pizzagate

1649
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,832
I really want you to track

1650
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,112
And that is

1651
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,184
The difference in the way that Alex talks about the WikiLeaks

1652
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
On his own show

1653
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,744
And in this interview with Pat

1654
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,536
Howell's fire wait

1655
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,560
You see nothing

1656
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
I see nothing

1657
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
So this whole thing with

1658
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:43,776
Pizzagate Theory not digging the stuff that you have that

1659
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
It was in the WikiLeaks

1660
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,296
Pizza place in d.c.

1661
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,904
Ferdibert ever like broken like a Mockingbird

1662
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
We had it all like

1663
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,232
The kids are going to be in the hot tub

1664
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,560
Obama wants two hot dogs $65,000 worth

1665
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
We were covering

1666
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
And then they diverted off

1667
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
The DC

1668
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,008
Oh yeah that's not what was going on

1669
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,312
So they all my God that is Billy doesn't exist

1670
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:22,944
So is this a like

1671
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:27,296
Juicy hotdog juicy succulent dog

1672
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,600
And I know he talks about that tub

1673
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,672
So willing

1674
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,744
They might resist but they want to have fun

1675
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
Like all that stuff

1676
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,168
He's strictly speaking on this accurately presenting

1677
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,216
She's not making the same

1678
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
That he does

1679
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
On broadcast

1680
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Because he knows

1681
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,848
But he's not talking to the same people

1682
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,664
And he has been showing the Patrick isn't going to give him

1683
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,504
Expect

1684
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,904
Juicy

1685
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
Herobrine life

1686
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:12,608
If you drive down Lawrence Avenue here in Chicago Illinois

Okay

1759
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,976
And then

1760
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:29,632
And then whenever we came here it was shaped exactly like Texas right now is it

1761
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:32,704
This is about who

1762
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,240
Thinking that he's Colonel Travis

1763
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
Okay

1764
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,824
Which is hilarious a song the truth

1765
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,664
Piece of it is that he also blasted

1766
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,736
Who's calling

1767
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,808

01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,632
But they knew that was

1770
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
I was so pissed off

01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,776

1775
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552

And building a future

1786
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,336
I wouldn't say it's Christ

1787
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,688
Right I mean even his Judas legislative acts that nobody ever

1788
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:49,504
No I bought it at 12 you don't think people back them up

1789
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,088
Luke Mark Matthew don't think so I'm asking who's on your side right now

1790

1791
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,464

Paranoid delusions of grandiosity I think I've ever heard in my

1798
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,920
Do you think you're doing is christ-like

1799
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
Yes

1800
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,856
Hydrolyzed

1801

1802
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,952
Stepped over that one so I drew another line

1803
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
Stepped over that one

1804
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,864
I mean

1805
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,472
The parallels with Colonel Travis a f****** real

1806
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:45,568
The parallels of him being a drunk f******

1807
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,104
Ruined

1808
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,384
A really long time

1809
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,712
Accidentally stumbled into being at the Alamo

1810
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:58,112
Think it's very similar to Alex's accidentally being the right place

1811
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,392
Rodger Stone

1812
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Manipulate

1813
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,488
Over the election.

1814
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:06,304
The election is

1815
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,376
He didn't die died

1816
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,400
He really wishes

1817
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,216
He is a man who wishes for

1818
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,616
That's why I'm kind of afraid of it

1819
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,152
Yeah but that's why he

1820
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,176
That's why I'm not

1821
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,784
Present-day episode we noticed a couple things or Alex

1822
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,064
Completely invalidating

1823
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,088
Entire life

1824
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
He called for federal troops

1825
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,208
To go to the Border

1826
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
Completely comfortable

1827
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Next clip

1828
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,752
Like I could not believe

1829
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
So let me flip that on you do believe in background checks

1830
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:57,760
I believe the Second Amendment I think criminals or any guns regardless

1831
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:01,088
But I do think what mental health other issues

1832
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
Background check

1833
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,584
Call prescription right now you're taking Prozac whatever it is some of the medication list that we have

1834
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,936
That is either for bipolar or whatever you know things that we just talked about

1835
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
Those folks can't get a gun you're okay with that

1836
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,872
There's something 30% of women around those drugs 15% man

1837
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
And

1838
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,456
A lot of people

1839
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,016
Don't like

1840
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,368
Before you respect my ride

1841
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
People that are on those drugs

1842
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,208
We answered says I can make it be a killer

1843
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,488
They should be looked at

1844
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,560
I think if somebody has been diagnosed

1845
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,656
Amazon those drives there should be a database and you shouldn't be a little fire

1846
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,824
That's relevant to

1847
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
But like that

1848
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:57,408
He's so count to Alex's beliefs

1849
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:00,224
Beauty sitting with his guidance

1850
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,528
Anyway it's okay for a background check

1851
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,064
Any kind of like

1852
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
Regulation about guns

1853
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:09,440
Is so counter to his bleached Because he believes that like

1854
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
Gun registration

1855
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,536
The exact same thing is taking away people's done

1856
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Towards

1857
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,144
Gun control is all of the step

1858
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:26,592
Yeah if you were diagnosed with a mental illness you shouldn't be able to because another piece of his narrative is the globalist

1859
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,640
Just want to give you full size no Seas

1860
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:35,040
In order to make sure you can't have guns

1861
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,576
Because you sitting there with the guy who

1862
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,368
Not putting up with this b*******

1863
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,904
He's having to sort of mitigate

1864
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,952
Come to the middle of little bit

1865
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,000
Cuz he knows that his normal s***

1866
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,280
Noctafly

1867
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
He's drunk enough

1868
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
2

1869
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,608
Be at that point where it's like

1870
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,680
Crazy

1871
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:54,240
Of course crazy people shouldn't have guns

1872
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Right

1873
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,568
Person that I would say the crazy people

1874
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:01,664
To be allowed to have. You know what it is I think it's recognizing

1875
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
I do believe

1876
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
Crazy people

1877
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,080
On what level

1878
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,920
Strategy

1879
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:40,320
Your principles

1880
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:45,696
Problem with the government

1881
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,720
Do you know what I would like

1882
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,048
You can continue on

1883
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
Ice cream

1884
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:51,840
F******

1885
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:54,912
I'm out there's a difference between a

1886
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,472
Conversation

1887
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,312
Televised interview

1888
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,360
Not on television

1889
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:09,760
Patrick wants to go down the road of like he's trying to get back to

1890
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,576
To the sensationalism stuff that Alex still have

1891
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,344
Address

1892
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,136
You've been trying to get that

1893
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
Answer

1894
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,208
From Alex

1895
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
He's not giving it

1896
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,560
Initially I asked

1897
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:28,960
What cause this is a self-inflicted you know is it something that happened is there a blind spot is there

1898
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:35,360
A lot of times in business you know entrepreneurs business people have blind spot The Reckless and certain area they're replicas gambling directly

1899
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
Do you think none of the blind spots for you is sometimes you get so excited

1900
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
Made it in your energy like you your words that come up so fast is a brain is going a million miles an hour

1901
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,976
Over selling something

1902
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,536
I'll tune in

1903
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,864
I was talking about how Anderson Cooper

1904
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,400
AirPrint

1905
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,224
Haralson place the CIA invasion

1906
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,272
The Arab Spring and he's a jerk

1907
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:22,720
Apologize

1908
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
Satisfying

1909
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,816
No I totally sometimes

1910
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,632
Like you hear your rebroadcast you're like

1911
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:37,056
Calculating

1912
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,104
Ninety-nine percent of the time

1913
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:42,432
How was it saying that were you okay okay

1914
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:51,392
Are you home

1915
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:55,744
Wow

1916
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:05,472
Devastating questions coming serapis

1917
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,520
Are you okay

1918
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:10,080
Say that after I say

1919
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
Said something

1920
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,224
How did that feel things that I've been like f*** you I am out of this s***

1921
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,064
Feel to say that shift Q

1922
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:24,928
F*** you I'm out of here

1923
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:37,728
Don't know why that was okay I don't know why that's okay

1924
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,752
Show out loud

1925
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,544
There's never a good guy

1926
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,616
I barely want to listen to the show after we recorded night

1927
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,408
And stuff like that

1928
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,200
Headphones baby

1929
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,504
I can't imagine the idea of being caught

1930
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,856
Listening

1931
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:04,608
16

1932
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,144
His parents hot tub

1933
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,216
Growth is a f****** less

1934
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:09,984
Even if

1935
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,056
Look if LeBron James told the story where he was hanging out with

1936
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:19,456
Kids watching highlights of the 2017 NBA Finals at be like a little a little

1937
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:27,904
At least he's not espousing racism during the game with LeBron's going to come back

1938
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,744
Alex

1939
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,864
Does taking responsibility only for mixing up Anderson Cooper and Tucker Carlson's name

1940
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,936
Did he say that he called

1941
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:46,592
I meant to say I called Tucker and apologize for mixing you up with 8

1942
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:52,992
Cooper called

1943
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:53,760
Anderson Cooper

1944
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,808
Yeah mix

1945
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,648
Through me for a loop when I first heard it as well

1946
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,184
Call India

1947
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,976
You could call

1948
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,280
Psychic

1949
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:08,608
So he's willing to take responsibility for mixing up bass

1950
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Fact

1951
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:12,192
Terms of like I got the name wrong

1952
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:21,152
I made a state

1953
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
Not me

1954
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:25,760
No no no

1955
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,320
Here's what happened

1956
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:33,952
But let me tell you what else did he tell you what else

1957
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:40,096
It boy could Bush or 911

1958
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:46,496
You take it a lot

1959
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
Okay

1960
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:51,616
Exaggerated

1961
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,272
Do you know what double-talk is

1962
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
Of course

1963
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,496
Yeah yeah

1964
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:21,568
This is 2 hours long cut out a lot of like

1965
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,616
Just heard there's a lot of me

1966
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:27,712
He goes down the wrong

1967
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,272
Still can see what

1968
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,576
Trying to do that

1969
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,136
But it's kind of like

1970
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:39,744
Dealing with Alex Jones this is the wrong tack

1971
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,544
You don't like that well I'll come back to that later once I softened you I'm over here and then I'll poke over here again

1972
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,712
Starting to slow down

1973
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:02,528
Right exactly what you're talking about

1974
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,600
Pizzagate came up earlier now it comes back up

1975
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:08,672
And it is much more problematic this time around

1976
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:12,000
Because Alex has just admitted that he exaggerated

1977
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:17,120
Yeah

1978
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:20,448
And suddenly you say

1979
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:24,800
Outside

1980
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,128
We have the Wikileaks in New York

1981
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:34,528
That is exactly what we were talking about

1982
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,160
Washington Post

1983
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:40,928
No

1984
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
Pizzagate

1985
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:46,816
MPI code words where they use Pizza Italian food

1986
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,888
Is it place we go look this there

1987
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:59,616
Demonize house and blackout

1988
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,408
What's going on

1989
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,712
That's what's going on

1990
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,504
Okay you did it again

1991
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:09,344
I told you I was okay

1992
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,904
Regenerate

1993
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:20,352
You lost credibility

1994
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:26,496
Nice nice nice

1995
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
You screwed up

1996
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,128
Screwed up you didn't screwed up

1997
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,152
Wow

1998
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
To what Alex is

1999
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,832
In the room

2000
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,392
Yeah but if you were actually responding to like

2001
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,440
Alex literally

2002
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:48,768
I'm only responding to the Washington Post New York Times reporting

2003
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,816
Conspiracy theorist

2004
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,352
Club

2005
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:58,496
4chan having all of these posts about this job and him being like

2006
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,568
Replay the clipping took off the internet where he's like

2007
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
You know what it's

2008
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
F***** up

2009
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:09,760
You got to check out their menu

2010
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,112
Exactly

2011
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:14,880
So

2012
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:21,280
Why is it that a giant piece of s*** is the only one who's interviewing Alex the best way because he's the only

2013
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,048
Funny person

2014
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
And has access

2015
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,216
Never interviewed by us

2016
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:33,824
Oh yeah

2017
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,360
Behind the bastards

2018
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:39,456
I could see a pretty good job of interviewing Alex

2019
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,480
Perhaps

2020
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,272
But you never agree to do that it

2021
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:46,624
Probably seems like a really spray

2022
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,184
You need a you need a mafia sting

2023
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:52,512
Have somebody like

2024
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,496
Bet-david to interview him

2025
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,032
But beforehand talked

2026
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:04,800
To someone like

2027
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,080
Yeah that is

2028
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,152
Probably the way you would ever

2029
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,688
You need someone

2030
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
Like us

2031
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,248
Or hear other people not just.

2032
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,528
Someone who knows

2033
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,296
Deal

2034
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
I mean I suppose

2035
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
PhD

2036
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,512
Packer

2037
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:26,048
Your life story

2038
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,584
Invalidates Alex is rhetoric

2039
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,704
It's some point in the interview bring up your refugee

2040
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:36,288
At some point bring up the fact that you had to flee a Ron

2041
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,080
During the iraq-iran war

2042
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,384
You are now

2043
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,688
Bring up the fact

2044
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:48,064
Become a productive member of American society

2045
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,856
Ostensibly a success

2046
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,624
Disagree

2047
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,904
I think that's the wrong way to go

2048
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,144
Conservative

2049
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,216
As being the people who are against illegal immigration

2050
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
Where

2051
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:14,688
Legal immigration

2052
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,224
That would be Alex's response

2053
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,760
Yeah I have Patrick abs

2054
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,528
Transcript

2055
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:22,368
About people like him

2056
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:26,720
And then Alex

01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,192
Please explain the contacts

2058
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,824
You said start with your purse

2059
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:49,248

Begin the interview

2062
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,392

Arrow in your quiver

2065
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,816
But you said leave out the part where your comment

2066
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,840
Well I'm just saying

2067
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,888

What if it was just purely educational what if it was just I'm going to get here

2092
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,040
The New York Times Washington Post

2093
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:33,440
The conspiracy theorist say there's a

2094
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:40,608
Is it fair to say that that I never covered that they supplies

2095
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:43,424
The Washington Post New York Times

2096
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:44,960

He didn't change all operative right

2108
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
Great whatever

2109
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,728
And then my report

01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,456
But you have been talking about Parts Authority Sports

Stop harassing the Sandy Hook family

2116
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:55,616
I looked at her I said lady I questioned that five years ago with other

2117
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,176
She knows a few Russian

2118
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,504
What the media

2119
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
Told me I left

2120
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:14,048
I don't want to talk about

2121
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:21,472
Stainless pot

2122
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:25,312
When you hear that hitting his fist on the app

2123
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,872
He's just going to

2124
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,152
Yeah did

2125
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,176
This is

2126
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,736
Hardman

2127
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:33,760
Crazy

2128
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:39,648
Get through already took him out of

2129
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,424
And I have

2130
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:54,240
I have tape of everything it'll prove me right

2131
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:01,408
He's trying to present himself as

2132
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,432
The victim again

2133
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,456
Took me out of

2134
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
Context

2135
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,992
You know how that

2136
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,016
Feel

2137
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:09,856
Alex

2138
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:13,440
Every single

2139
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:16,256
Rape very hard to heaven

2140
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,048
Empathy

2141
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,680
Alex is something that I think

2142
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,216
Super f***** up

2143
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,496
And I didn't know with something

2144
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,776
You might believe

2145
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:31,360
This is really bad

2146
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
Man versus

2147
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,688
Right

2148
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:36,992
Who's nature robot-man versus

2149
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:39,552
Robot robot

2150
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,696
Just focus on what you just said to me about

2151
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,000
You said

2152
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,280
I didn't bring up pizzagate

2153
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,096
And then I started talking

2154
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,120
Right

2155
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,424
Fine that's kind of like you saying

2156
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,472
Add an event guns

2157
01:56:57,984 --> 01:56:58,752
I just used it

2158
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,056
So you took that story

2159
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,848
That they started talking about

2160
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:07,200
Mnu sensationalized

2161
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:17,696
That is like a lady must first holyshit

2162
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:24,608
Now Alex's conspiracy is that that shooting at Comet Ping Pong to happen

2163
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:29,472
Best and I don't

2164
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:32,800
Really appreciate that petrogen pushback on that

2165
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:35,616
Whatever you want

2166
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:38,176
I don't know what do you say to that other than like

2167
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:45,088
Are you just going to not acknowledge reality ever only thing as the interviewer

2168
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,904
In this case is make sure that he says specifically what

2169
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,440
The Patrick doesn't

2170
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:55,328
Worker at 8

2171
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,608
Out-of-work actor

2172
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:58,400
Set the media got to do this

2173
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,168
It was all fake

2174
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:05,056
Interviewer is today

2175
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,152
Without realizing you

2176
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,432
Interspecific

2177
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,760
That shooting didn't happen

2178
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,808
You know who the victim of that shooting was

2179
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,088
James Oliphant

2180
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:23,744
Threaten to sue Alex and got a public apology from

2181
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,792
Yep so now he's on this

2182
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:32,192
New platformer is being interviewed he said the shooting is fake

2183
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:39,104
That is now James elephante standing to reopen

2184
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,408
Consequences of because

2185
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:43,200
Alex issued a public retraction

2186
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:45,760
These could be

2187
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,832
You know what's crazy though is that this is stop sounding like an a

2188
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,880
Interview to me and started more

2189
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,160
Sounding like a

2190
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,184
Like

2191
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,512
I'm taking an employee into the back to explain why they

2192
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,536
Cleaned up the floors

2193
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
Look

2194
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:06,496
I don't think what you're doing is bad I think you're bad at doing

2195
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,288
There is kind of spo2

2196
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:11,104
Patrick bet-david

2197
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,640
David's

2198
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,688
His background is

2199
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,736
Entrepreneur

2200
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,016
Being sort of

2201
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,576
Advice guy

2202
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,904
I think that his sort of worldview and his

2203
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
Is

2204
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,696
Brenda is chi

2205
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:26,720
Kind of that coaching

2206
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,768
Yeah

2207
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,304
Alex

2208
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,376
How can you do what you do better

2209
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,448
Do you understand you f***** up you don't

2210
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:42,080
He doesn't understand

2211
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,408
I think you're a great

2212
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,456
And I really like the way you're going

2213
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,736
However

2214
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,784
Do you think you made some

2215
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,576
What is your fault

2216
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,880
What do you think you could improve

2217
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:59,232
Imagine pulp I would admit to more mistakes analysis

2218
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,608
Fucken love that guy

2219
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:09,728
At this point I think of Patrick kind of recognizes that those wrote that he's been going down or kind of

2220
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:14,080
Idea of the sensationalism the idea of other people

2221
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
Kicked off to save

2222
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:19,968
Exaggerate

2223
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,784
Right button turns of

2224
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:25,344
Actually getting anywhere with the p

2225
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
ORD Sandy Hook

2226
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,928
Alex brought up himself

2227
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,256
Cuz apparently that's the only thing that's breaking Alex's brain right now

2228
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
I think he realizes

2229
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:35,328
Nothing we can do about this

2230
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,864
Let's save it onto.

2231
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,144
Just like hot topic

2232
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:42,752
Yes Tim about college

2233
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:45,824
Alex yes

2234
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,616
Education

2235
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:55,552
Burping up booze question about how much you hate College

2236
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,368
What is your thoughts on the current occasional system

2237
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:01,952
I think the total scam like Rush Limbaugh used to say

2238
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,256
I went to college

2239
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:20,128
So I was in sales

2240
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:23,200
I was like 19 years old

2241
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:26,016
And so I just thought it was more of an indoctrination

2242
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:30,112
So real quick if you was making $100,000 in sales

2243
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,648
As a nineteen-year-old there's a

2244
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,208
She was working

2245
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:40,608
And some sort of a Cutco MLM type he might have been a very successful

2246
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:45,984
Entirely possible hundred thousand dollars as a nineteen-year-old with Noah

2247
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,288
Credible

2248
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,824
I think he's exaggerating

2249
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:52,896
Heelys

2250
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,920
Probably was happening

2251
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
But it was some sort of

2252
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,784
Thing like that

2253
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,832
I don't know we only have

2254
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,368
Information to go on

2255
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,136
And he's a liar

2256
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,696
Who knows exactly what he's talking

2257
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:09,280
It seems like that might be

2258
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:15,424
So it took many years and that's why I got up

2259
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:19,776
Occasionally

2260
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,616
That's where I stand on

2261
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:26,432
Do you need me

2262
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,200
Hard

2263
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,016
Ace Hardware

2264
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:34,112
Narrator

2265
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,928
Raised our job

2266
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,976
Uni School

2267
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:41,792
Anything outside of stem you don't answer

2268
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,072
The kind of what you're saying

2269
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:56,384
Maybe the concern is that the big debts

2270
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:02,784
Do you have a strong opinion on how you would improve it cuz I'm curious to know if there's 12

2271
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:13,024
Indoctrination

2272
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,560
Real

2273
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,096
Today real world

2274
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,400
Application for engineering

2275
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,448
4culture for saez

2276
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,216
4 jobs

2277
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,544
Not about until they are

2278
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,592
Patiently

2279
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:28,128
Education

2280
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:31,968
All of those things are political

2281
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:33,248
Today

2282
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,296
In 2018

2283
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
Interesting

2284
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:44,000
One of those things that he mentioned that is not inherently political enough

2285
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:45,536
Even take that out of it

2286
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:47,584
Just uses words

2287
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,120
These things

2288
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:55,520
The problem with education is very political

2289
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,824
And make it about engineering

2290
02:03:58,592 --> 02:03:59,616
Hulcher

2291
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:00,640
He says

2292
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,664
Coach

2293
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:03,456
In what it supposed to be

2294
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:09,856
What are you saying

2295
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:12,416
You know what you just need to go in the most

2296
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:15,488
Training for jobs being a lawyer being an engineer

2297
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:18,048
But the brain

2298
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,584
Culture being part of it

2299
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,120
Leads me to believe

2300
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,424
You just like wow I want

2301
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:26,240
I want a white Mist the apartment

2302
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:30,080
Yeah when you say culture most people think like Oh you mean Humanity

2303
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:33,920
Accepting

2304
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,712
The white culture that we have

2305
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,480
Well because

2306
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:38,016
Probably

2307
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:41,856
Currently colleges are brainwashing

2308
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,136
It's because of the idea of

2309
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,416
Plurality

2310
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,184
And diversity

2311
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,464
Exist

2312
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:49,536
College students protested

2313
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,352
Support

2314
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,120
Black

2315
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:55,424
Anyway

2316
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,192
Farthest

2317
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,216
Firmus

2318
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:57,984
Evidence

2319
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,008
Did Alex Jones

2320
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,032
Is f****** s***

2321
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,312
Yeah

2322
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
Patrick brings up David Brock

2323
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
And Alex comes up with

2324
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:12,576
You don't know the guy who

2325
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:15,904
Runza

2326
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,928
Alex

2327
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:20,000
But

2328
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:20,768
But

2329
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
Alex comes up with a joke

2330
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:23,584
And won't let it go

2331
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:28,960
Basically tortorices toilet

2332
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,544
George Soros

2333
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,616
Sonera

2334
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:37,408
Solace globalist

2335
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,712
It takes hundreds of millions of dollars to

2336
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:41,248
Attack the First Amendment

2337
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,320
Infiltrate the organization engagement

2338
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,624
All sorts of Marvel activities

2339
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:49,184
Absolutely traitorous individual

2340
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:54,816
Is George soros's toilet

2341
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:57,376
Sohu

2342
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,472
Got it

2343
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:05,312
I fully get it

2344
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
I get it

2345
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,712
Next

2346
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,248
Awesome

2347
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
Because

2348
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:17,344
There is a question that a lot of people

2349
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,112
Alex Jones

2350
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:22,720
Yes and that is okay

2351
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:25,024
Boxers or briefs bro

2352
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,560
No it's about 9/11

2353
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:31,424
Now I don't like to dive too deep into Alex

2354
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:32,192
911

2355
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:34,240
Super productive

2356
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,800
Hagar's alot of other people covered it

2357
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,616
Do that on your

2358
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:41,920
I just don't like it all that

2359
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,552
You talk a lot about 911

2360
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,344
What do you know about

2361
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,904
Let's talk about 9/11

2362
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,928
Since today

2363
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:58,560
Is 911

2364
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:02,144
Who was really behind the 9/11 would Witcher studied over the years

2365
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,168
And with your spoken about

2366
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,960
I don't know who's fine

2367
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:12,384
You should really know if you're the guy who

2368
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:18,272
On your show you definitely presented as if you know

2369
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
Do you say it is

2370
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:25,696
I mean okay

2371
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,464
About it all the time

2372
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,512
You know exactly who's behind

2373
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:38,752
You know what those terrorists this is the exact same thing as what we talked about

2374
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,288
She has

2375
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,336
A pitch that you'd like

2376
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,664
We recognize the Patrick's going to ask him another question

2377
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:50,272
I'm going to work I'll just say I don't know

2378
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:54,624
Eventually lands on

2379
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,392
Dick Cheney

2380
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,672
As being sort of

2381
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:02,560
But he brings up the project for a New American Century documents

2382
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:03,840
Building America

2383
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,168
Which is very unfair

2384
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:11,264
Rebuilding America's defenses

2385
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
Before 911

2386
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:17,920
3000 people that says this

2387
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:20,224
Weapons

2388
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,672
I was more liberal

2389
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,976
Waipouli

2390
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:36,352
Then I was more of a liberal

2391
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:41,728
Still didn't want to kill I delivered to that like three times because I thought that's what he said

2392
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:44,032
I was more of a liberal back then

2393
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:50,432
And I still don't want to kill all the most

2394
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:54,784
Staples

2395
02:08:55,040 --> 02:09:01,184
Of course I thought like oh my God how drunk are using yet but now it's clear

2396
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,744
Back then I was more liberal

2397
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,280
But I also still don't

2398
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:11,424
Okay so that

2399
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,752
I want to pick it up

2400
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:20,896
We got raped and the problem is it'll kill

2401
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,456
22%

2402
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:26,272
70% blocks

2403
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,064
Cuz Arabs are a mix of the two

2404
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:32,160
But we should be ready to release it and I'm like reading this

2405
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:36,000
Can subpoena documents

2406
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:39,072
And they're talked about killing everybody

2407
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,864
World government

2408
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,424
This Republic

2409
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,192
You can

2410
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:50,592
I like the idea that he sort of think that people in the Middle East are like a chocolate and vanilla swirl

2411
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:57,248
Brown people obviously that's his wife was black

2412
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:06,976
Elementary level

2413
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:11,840
Chinese is just like a part of this place

2414
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:15,424
Saudi

2415
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:20,544
Project for New American Century the peanut document

2416
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,848
Sort of a boogeyman

2417
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,896
For the anti-rape

2418
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,688
Part of Alex's

2419
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,528
Yeah he made a lot of hay out of this and a lot of people who are

2420
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,832
Sort of left-leaning Alex

2421
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,624
Types will bring that up as

2422
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,928
These people did 9/11

2423
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:45,632
It is bad but you look at the documents f****** bad

2424
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:53,312
Teaneck document is pretty shity document that does absolutely lead one to suspect that should the people who wrote

2425
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:56,128
This sort of thing

2426
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,152
Seriously

2427
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:59,712
In order that they might be able to exploit a tragedy in order

2428
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:01,760
Push through

2429
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,064
That in no way proves that they

2430
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,344
Did 9/11

2431
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,160
But still should learn all the races a trip to the

2432
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:11,232
About the rape

2433
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,816
Proof that Cheney was

2434
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:15,584
Is behind

2435
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:24,800
Very easily could have been behind seriously could have had a part and not

2436
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,080
Yeah

2437
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:27,104
Because

2438
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:31,456
Store things they would like to happen in order to perpetuate their agenda

2439
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,736
Possible

2440
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:37,344
YouTube video about them wanting

2441
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,880
I have a bunch of

2442
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:40,160
It's not in

2443
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,536
Further the process of transformation

2444
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:47,328
Even if it brings revolutionary change

2445
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:50,144
Absent some catastrophic

2446
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,168
Catalyzing

2447
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:52,704
Like a new Pearl Harbor

2448
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:55,776
Proof they did 9/11

2449
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:58,848
Thousand people

2450
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,408
I hope that ships that would be weird

2451
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,480
Like I said some sort of

2452
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:06,272
Well we had a we had a

2453
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,832
Statistic I go back through history and we found it

2454
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:11,648
Cadillac

2455
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,416
Is the Transformer

2456
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:15,488
There's a Mendoza Line

2457
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,768
Above that

2458
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:18,560
You can still go below that

2459
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:24,960
People don't care

2460
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:26,240
Passage

2461
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:27,520
Information Systems

2462
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:29,312
Becoming important focus of attack

2463
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:31,360
Particularly for us enemies seeking

2464
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:32,128
The short circuit

2465
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:33,408
Sophisticated American

2466
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:36,480
Advanced forms of biological warfare

2467
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:37,760
Target

2468
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,040
Specific genotype

2469
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:42,624
May transform biological warfare from the round of terrorism

2470
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,160
Politically useful

2471
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,232
About

2472
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,024
The United States

2473
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,560
It's important

2474
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,096
Didn't realize

2475
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,632
One thing

2476
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:58,240
The name of the document is rebuilding America's defenses

2477
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,288
And if the entire context of the passage

2478
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:01,312
Threat

2479
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:02,336
That the United States

2480
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,104
Mike Faison

2481
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:03,872
In the coming years at

2482
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,152
Technology

2483
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,688
And malevolent actors game

2484
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,480
Various unforeseen it

2485
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:09,248
Advantages

2486
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:11,808
So hypothetical

2487
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:14,880
Things that could be stuff we need to protect against

2488
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:18,976
As opposed to we have developed a specific bio-weapon

2489
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,536
Sweet Leaf

2490
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,816
Take this out of context

2491
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:24,352
Which earlier in the center

2492
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:26,144
Crying about other people doing today

2493
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:27,680
Now

2494
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,960
The other thing

2495
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:29,728
Consideration

2496
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:30,496
It's very important

2497
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:33,824
Is genotype is not the same thing as race

2498
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848
What

2499
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:35,872
Damn

2500
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:40,736
But I went to Community College for a couple of years and I learned all the stem fields

2501
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:44,064
Are you telling me that they didn't throw that in there

2502
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,624
Weapons that could Target genotype

2503
02:13:48,672 --> 02:13:49,696
Conceivably think we should be

2504
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:51,488
Be worried about someone developing

2505
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,328
Yeah

2506
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:58,400
It's not the same thing as a race specific bioweapon

2507
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,448
According to the NIH

2508
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,544
Strict categories exclusive an exhaustive in which each human being is

2509
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:09,152
The basis of genetic characteristics

2510
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
Are unattainable

2511
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,968
Genetics

2512
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:15,552
Definitive human classification system

2513
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,600
To address the many facets

2514
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
Health differ

2515
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:20,928
Is almost a

2516
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,976
Not thing

2517
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,000
Race

2518
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,816
Primarily exist to the social constructs

2519
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:29,376
And that's the game that Alex is operating on

2520
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:30,912
Yet he tries to

2521
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:31,680
Use it as

2522
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:32,704
Some sort of

2523
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:35,264
To bolster narratives like this

2524
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:37,312
None of this is to defend

2525
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:40,384
None of this is.

2526
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:44,480
Nothing for unfair

2527
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:45,760
So

2528
02:14:46,016 --> 02:14:52,160
That didn't exist saying that goes specific bio-weapon

2529
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,696
So

2530
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:55,232
Bio weapon

2531
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,768
Scan the color

2532
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,328
Right right

2533
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:01,632
Genetics they have like a Optics

2534
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:02,656
Computer it's like drum

2535
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:09,312
So you know the most rates Pacific bio-weapon is

2536
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,872
A white guy with a gun

2537
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:18,528
Is that a really specific really race specific bioweapon

2538
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,296
So let's

2539
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,064
Take this

2540
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,600
Bacchus

2541
02:15:22,624 --> 02:15:23,392
Patrick Wilson

2542
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,440
What do you know about 9

2543
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:26,720
Alex said

2544
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,768
I don't know I don't know who that is

2545
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,304
Now Patrick

2546
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:31,328
The follow-up question

2547
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,376
Problematic

2548
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,144
For Alex's

2549
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,168
Entire

2550
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:36,704
Sense of self

2551
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:39,776
You make it easy sometimes these people to take shots

2552
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:42,336
Some people also on the flip side say

2553
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:44,384
Alex

2554
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:50,784
Could have contacts on the inside with the CIA and DEA that he knows people that are feeding him stop etcetera etcetera

2555
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:55,648
Is there anybody you know that on the inside of connecting you and telling you stuff because of that is true

2556
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,696
You would have more information on 9/11

2557
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:00,512
Because of the stuff you're talking about 5 billion views then

2558
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:02,816
Wouldn't somebody from the inside

2559
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:07,168
Who is opposing like rhinitis into somebody on the inside that's working with rum that opposes them

2560
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:13,568
Somebody would contact me I like to send information to pass them to you real quick

2561
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:14,848
Question for Alex which is

2562
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:20,224
If you have the sources that you claim to you should know more about 9/11

2563
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,552
Deep problem for Alex's

2564
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:31,232
Groceries 5 years ago

2565
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,000
No

2566
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:39,936
Defend the country were trying to stop War I don't talk

2567
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:43,520
People about what happened 18 years ago

2568
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:49,920
Today's Dental

2569
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:55,296
Talk about

2570
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,576
How you doing

2571
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:58,624
Talk people

2572
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:03,744
You know in corporations in medias

2573
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:08,352
But it's not like they're just American Patriots like I am

2574
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:10,656
So I'm not like sitting there

2575
02:17:11,168 --> 02:17:12,704
Talking about

2576
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,240
17 years ago

2577
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,776
We're trying to like

2578
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:19,104
How we boost the stock market how do we fix the country

2579
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:25,248
How we make America come together

2580
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:31,904
Why did Brianna ever was by the way

2581
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:34,464
Everybody together in Glide

2582
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,232
Peaceful

2583
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:38,816
And how we make the world better place if they stick a literally

2584
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:39,584
What prop

2585
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,120
How do we make a better picture

2586
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:43,936
It is not a leftist

2587
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,960
Religious War

2588
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:47,776
We want unification

2589
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,080
They want a free market system

2590
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:51,616
We want Justice

2591
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:57,504
Your mission is to empower people and have them believe they're powerful

2592
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,832
Whether Christian or Muslim or agnostic or gay or straight

2593
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:02,880
To unify people around

2594
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:03,904
Human victory

2595
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:10,048
Definition of anon

2596
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:14,144
Because

2597
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:16,704
Call Ziggy

2598
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,240
Probably could be achieved by

2599
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:21,568
One of your sources telling you what happened with 911

2600
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,848
So that's like

2601
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,712
The answer again

2602
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:29,248
He's the weakest link of this

2603
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,808
Cuz

2604
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,880
We need to find a way to

2605
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,416
And then in the next press

2606
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:39,232
We need to get radical Islam out-of-the-way

2607
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,512
Right

2608
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:43,840
What's your definition of radical Islam

2609
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,144
Georgia

2610
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
Is all

2611
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:53,312
Islam so how do we find a way to not be war with Islam

2612
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:58,688
Way of saying we need an ethnic cleansing because they're divided

2613
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,456
I mean

2614
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:04,576
Hey you combine nuclear material within the nuclear material there

2615
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:16,608
Text

2616
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:22,240
Weird

2617
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:27,872
About language in the way that we use a euphemism to say

2618
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:30,944
But if you say it directly

2619
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:31,968
Everybody get

2620
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,736
Mad at you

2621
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:37,088
Well but they would give you for using that euphemistically they understood

2622
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:38,112
Junior saying

2623
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:41,952
Or at least like I think that Patrick would push back against

2624
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:47,328
She had more of a robust understand

2625
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:53,728
You might as well have stood on top of a federal f****** soapbox and said

2626
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:58,080
Kill the Islamic but if you if you are someone like

2627
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,896
I assume Patrick bet-david

2628
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:03,200
Who thinks that there is a like a

2629
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,736
A problem with radical Islam

2630
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:07,040
You could hear Alex say

2631
02:20:07,552 --> 02:20:08,064
Radicalism

2632
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,880
The problem there are all those terrorists

2633
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:14,720
And stuff like that and not recognize that in Alex's definition

2634
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,000
The word that is

2635
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:23,168
There is no room for moderate Islam in his world so

2636
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:28,544
Dangerous

2637
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,080
Two are Beyond

2638
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:32,384
Prepared and have interviews with people like him

2639
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:35,968
Because you will accidentally be tricked into thinking that they're saying something

2640
02:20:38,528 --> 02:20:39,552
You and I both know

2641
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:45,184
Alex is advocating for the elimination of a religion population

2642
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:49,280
Now speakers

2643
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:50,816
It's just like okay gif

2644
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:53,120
An example of Defying Gravity

2645
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:55,936
What's your motto

2646
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:01,568
Spring of genocide

2647
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:03,616
Who tried to pull that off earlier

2648
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:06,944
Patrick

2649
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,248
An interesting question about Nazis

2650
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:10,784
Did Alex

2651
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
Is

2652
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,320
Stove

2653
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,368
F****** adverse to answering

2654
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:20,768
Then I think it means something I think it might be

2655
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:23,328
Jordans

2656
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:26,400
No this is there more than one word in it

2657
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:28,960
It's probably not a date is a mic down

2658
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:33,312
Here we go

2659
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:35,616
Bashas the

2660
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,920
You know a lot of times I'll say

2661
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:40,224
You know he is so nice

2662
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:43,040
You so kind

2663
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,576
What you have to say about that

2664
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,720
It says it's like a mentally ill

2665
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:55,840
Go online

2666
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:57,120
Knox

2667
02:21:57,376 --> 02:21:58,400
Ologist

2668
02:21:59,936 --> 02:22:00,704
So what do you think about

2669
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,776
Nazis

2670
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:07,360
Play Lost World War and

2671
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:10,176
Okay babe

2672
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:20,416
I think they need to be tracked based on whatever they're whatever they're doing right now in

2673
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,696
Hey Blanca prison

2674
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:23,232
Goodbye great

2675
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,256
So what are you going to

2676
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:26,816
So that your opinion is wrong

2677
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,608
What are you doing I'm asking you

2678
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:29,632
What are you doing

2679
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:31,424
What do you do about knots

2680
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:35,264
Probably

2681
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:41,152
Because you actually are in this world

2682
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:42,432
Maybe I disagree

2683
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:47,808
What is Earth

2684
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:49,600
What world

2685
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:51,392
Am I supporting Aziz

2686
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:55,232
Tell me you don't support kindness

2687
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,840
Meraki love free market

2688
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:04,192
There's no group that attacked me more than

2689
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:07,008
That's why pitbulls are statement that

2690
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:10,080
Because the average Nazi

2691
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:11,104
Is a

2692
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:14,176
Southern Poverty Law Center 80 alarm

2693
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:16,480
Okay

2694
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:18,784
So what we've had is

2695
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:25,184
Alex asked about whether or not he supports what the Nazis support

2696
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:28,512
What's the situation with jfg only walked

2697
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:31,840
Flip the question

2698
02:23:33,888 --> 02:23:36,192
Go ahead just off the top of your head

2699
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,728
Nazis that's got nuts

2700
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:38,752
Bed bath

2701
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,408
Of the accomplishments that the Nazi

2702
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:46,176
These have made

2703
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:48,480
What is their top five worst

2704
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,760
Things that they

2705
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,952
How you feel about Nazis

2706
02:23:58,208 --> 02:24:00,512
You could say genocide is that right

2707
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:03,840
Actually Alex I accidentally

2708
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,120
Sort of agrees with

2709
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:11,264
Anti-communist certainly a big part of their programs was to

2710
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,544
The Kill

2711
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:19,456
You know what my first response to why don't you like Nazis influence

2712
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:23,296
Aloft

2713
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:25,600
And how they're it Legacy

2714
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:30,720
Still tons of people who are on the street and actually right protest

2715
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:33,536
Alex Jones supports and refuses to

2716
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:39,936
In anyway say negative things about you know what you know what I wouldn't say my biggest problem with the Nazis

2717
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:41,984
They lost

2718
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:45,568
No cuz it sure seems like his biggest problem with the Nazi

2719
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:51,968
Why would I talk about Nazis

2720
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,760
I'm talking about the all right

2721
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,296
We rebranded

2722
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:59,648
So many of the people that are in

2723
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:00,672
His world

2724
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:05,280
Which one

2725
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,304
Patrick

2726
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,072
Tries

2727
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
Do this again

2728
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,144
Tries to refocus and get Alex

2729
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:10,912
To actually

2730
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:13,728
Answer the question which is a super easy question

2731
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:18,080
People save yourself.

2732
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:24,480
No not f*** them they're up crazy

2733
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,504
Organization

2734
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,272
Name

2735
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:28,064
They're hiding under different banners

2736
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:34,464
Nationalism

2737
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:37,536
Even the free market but there are people who are using those terms

2738
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:40,096
In order to mask their Nazism

2739
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:43,424
And their white supremacy and I disavow that entirely

2740
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:50,080
To make the argument that I'm making pure and that is really just about nationalism

2741
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:54,688
I have a responsibility to call this out within our own ranks

2742
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,712
It is that

2743
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,576
You further till go in that last

2744
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:03,648
That they're losers and then

2745
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,672
Plch

2746
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:06,208
Not good

2747
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:09,792
It's so much worse

2748
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:12,096
Seriously it's like asking me

2749
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:17,216
What do you make

2750
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:19,264
Alice gildea on I-45

2751
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,312
What am I

2752
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:27,712
If it's sometimes

2753
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:33,344
The knot

2754
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,928
You say you know this hit or did it back in the days in America doing the same thing

2755
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:42,560
So

2756
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:46,144
Give me the first five minutes you said that

2757
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:48,448
First 5 minutes of duration

2758
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:51,776
You want me to reply for you

2759
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:54,848
Now it's

2760
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:56,896
Tens of thousands of Articles of month

2761
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:02,272
Never showing what I supposedly said just

2762
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:04,320
This is clearly

2763
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:09,440
What the Nazis did Hitler but I'm criticizing Nazi Germany

2764
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:11,744
No you're not pro-hitler what you're criticizing that

2765
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:14,560
You bring that up

2766
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:20,192
2019

2767
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,472
Okay well

2768
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:33,760
No I said

2769
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:35,552
So you don't support what they stand for

2770
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,904
Socialism

2771
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:48,864
Yoo-hoo

2772
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:53,728
I'm not

2773
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:55,008
Tell me another

2774
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:55,776
Check timer

2775
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:06,016
When have I this is the craziness of leftist there's a double standard

2776
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:10,368
To find anywhere that I support Luzerne

2777
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:18,816
Let's just go through a list of Alex Jones's

2778
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:24,960
Tommy Robinson very frequent Tommy Robinson is the founder of

2779
02:28:25,216 --> 02:28:25,728
The edl

2780
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:27,520
The England Defense League

2781
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:29,056
He also has

2782
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,920
Two Nazi groups in England

2783
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:37,760
So there's one very

2784
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:40,064
Strong white supremacist

2785
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:46,464
Not be history before he was before he was on

2786
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:50,304
Stephen yaxley-lennon

2787
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,352
Existed online

2788
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,632
Without his

2789
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:56,192
Because of those Neo-Nazi groups

2790
02:28:56,448 --> 02:29:01,056
That he was apart of originally

2791
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,080
There's one

2792
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:04,128
2nd Marine Le Pen

2793
02:29:04,384 --> 02:29:04,896
Heard

2794
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:11,040
That's her

2795
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:14,368
Her dad was part of the European front

2796
02:29:14,624 --> 02:29:20,512
VIP not be lingering group friends he was apart of

2797
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:25,120
We just want to go European

2798
02:29:25,888 --> 02:29:28,704
Now if you want to talk about the guest that Alex's had on there's a

2799
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,496
The bunch of them

2800
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,288
On Red Ice Radio

2801
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:34,592
Which is a literal

2802
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:35,616
Nazi

2803
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,384
Group

2804
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,944
The does a Nazi podcast out of Europe

2805
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:45,088
The photo was recently against on Red Ice Radio

2806
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,136
He still my favorite crazy

2807
02:29:47,648 --> 02:29:49,696
I just imagine

2808
02:29:49,952 --> 02:29:50,976
Batman

2809
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:55,072
Now if you look into the narratives that Alex Trebek

2810
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:56,864
Overlap with

2811
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,656
People like identity evropa

2812
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,424
Vanguard

2813
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:02,240
Even places like

2814
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:03,520
There's a

2815
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:05,056
Honda of overlap in

2816
02:30:05,312 --> 02:30:06,336
Things those

2817
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:10,688
The world and would Alex Dance Force if you want to talk about concrete

2818
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:12,736
You have those people

2819
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:14,528
That are influencers of Alex

2820
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:15,808
That are also members

2821
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:18,112
Neo-Nazi organization

2822
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,672
Now if you want to talk about the narrative

2823
02:30:21,696 --> 02:30:23,232
Maybe you want to talk about people

2824
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:24,512
He has on like

2825
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:28,096
That are specifically

2826
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,936
Their existence is only to fight

2827
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:38,080
The question

2828
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:41,408
How you might say answer a yes or no question

2829
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:43,200
Right so your yes or no question

2830
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,992
Do you like Nazis

2831
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:46,272
If your answer is

2832
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:56,000
Now yes or no

2833
02:30:56,256 --> 02:31:00,608
With the question not even another step question I said

2834
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:02,144
I don't like them

2835
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:03,680
Take another step

2836
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:05,216
Wrestle with

2837
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:06,496
The fact that Alex

2838
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:08,288
Stanley calls George Soros a Nazi

2839
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:09,824
The collaborator when that is not

2840
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,128
You have some sort of deflection

2841
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:19,552
It look into how to use a Nazi propaganda whether it be

2842
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:20,832
Already

2843
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:23,904
Before that but they perpetuated very heavily

2844
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:26,976
Idea that Jews commit bloodline

2845
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,280
The idea that they poisoned the well

2846
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,304
Those

2847
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,864
Very deeply entrenched in Alex's narrative

2848
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:35,680
Further his ideas about the globalist

2849
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:38,240
Reinforced by

2850
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,008
The

2851
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:44,128
Forgery anti-semitic hoax the protocols of the Elders of Zion

2852
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,176
Adolf Hitler used

2853
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,224
His propaganda campaign

2854
02:31:48,480 --> 02:31:51,552
American Nazis like Ford

2855
02:31:51,808 --> 02:31:52,320
Used

2856
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:55,904
And their anti Jew propaganda

2857
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,184
Presidents dad

2858
02:31:57,696 --> 02:32:03,328
Right electric President's Day

2859
02:32:06,912 --> 02:32:10,240
I meant

2860
02:32:10,496 --> 02:32:11,776
Discussed in the endgame

2861
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:15,360
This idea of Alex's world

2862
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:16,640
Contingent on the ideas

2863
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:17,664
The Rothschilds

2864
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:19,200
Nathan de Rothschild

2865
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:25,600
The Battle of Waterloo English

2866
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:27,904
Market in order to buy

2867
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,440
Pattern and the bottle

2868
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:34,816
That Alex uses to talk about these other globalist

2869
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:36,608
Conquests of countries

2870
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:43,264
That's based on Rothschild

2871
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,568
That is a Nazi propaganda film

2872
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:47,104
So Alex would you ask

2873
02:32:48,384 --> 02:32:49,408
You challenge me

2874
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,224
To bring up the things that make

2875
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,016
You kind of a Nazi

2876
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:55,552
There is my aunt

2877
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:58,624
And then the officers all day

2878
02:33:02,464 --> 02:33:03,232
This is pathetic

2879
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:09,888
Because because because you have that like four minutes of him refusing to answer the question

2880
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:12,960
About the Nazis up and then at the end say I challenge

2881
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:16,544
Like no I don't like nothing

2882
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:21,920
Like that's the expensive

2883
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:25,504
Then you can answer that question fortunately so many people don't know

2884
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:26,528
What was that

2885
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:31,904
If we had this interview with Tucker Carlson or Ash on hands

2886
02:33:32,928 --> 02:33:34,464
Have the answer ready

2887
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:37,280
So they wouldn't be caught doing

2888
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:43,680
Unprepared

2889
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:46,496
It's so easy

2890
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:49,312
So indicative of how much Alex

2891
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:51,360
Don't believe in all of this s***

2892
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:57,760
Call Aunt house

2893
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:04,928
What yeah I wonder if

2894
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:11,840
Interviewed Sean Hannity find out Sean Hannity

2895
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:13,376
Actual Nazi beliefs

2896
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:20,544
What kind of Rich Man interview

2897
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,824
Oh yeah by the way

2898
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,848
I think

2899
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:23,616
Just listen to him

2900
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:28,480
But if you watch the interview.

2901
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:30,016
The David

2902
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:36,672
Rolls off the tongue with Ben Shapiro

2903
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,696
Push back this heart

2904
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,232
He's doing it specifically

2905
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,000
2 hours

2906
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:40,768
Right

2907
02:34:41,024 --> 02:34:42,560
Because Alex has a lot of holes

2908
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:43,840
But then also

2909
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,120
He's asking the second

2910
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,936
Which in this instance

2911
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:50,752
During this exchange about Nazis.

2912
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:53,056
Question

2913
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:57,408
Alex

2914
02:34:57,664 --> 02:34:58,176
Fire

2915
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:00,480
So they get off this topic and Alex makes

2916
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:02,272
Probably the lamest

2917
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:04,320
Claim I've ever

2918
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,088
Okay

2919
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:06,112
Music

2920
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:19,168
Didn't Jesus play the Makaveli I don't I don't know if I'm saying Jesus's Big Boy level I'm not talk.

2921
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:24,800
Straight up

2922
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:28,384
The next level

2923
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:29,664
What you're saying

2924
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:31,968
I really want prosperity

2925
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,528
Globalism

2926
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:35,808
I want to sexual

2927
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,600
And I am XL

2928
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:44,256
Turn up okay

2929
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:46,048
Control

2930
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,096
I love God

2931
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,912
Bebop

2932
02:35:51,168 --> 02:35:51,936
Bobbi Boss

2933
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:52,960
What is a mutant

2934
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,496
Rizzo price

2935
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:58,080
You're so products

2936
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:02,688
But I wouldn't

2937
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:05,760
I sell things t-shirts books

2938
02:36:06,016 --> 02:36:07,040
To find myself

2939
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:10,112
But that's people

2940
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,952
Compromise

2941
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:15,488
You're selling you making money

2942
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:16,768
You can't be bought

2943
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,792
What can be bought

2944
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:20,096
Skellington's is only fuel

2945
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:21,888
Carry out my operation

2946
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:25,472
Selling fingers to fuel to carry out my operation

2947
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,752
But you can't be pods

2948
02:36:27,264 --> 02:36:30,336
Yeah like that money is not

2949
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:37,504
Doing good for Humanity and Wang is where I want to go and so I'll sell t-shirts books videos

2950
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:40,064
Attwater location air filtration

2951
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,624
Airforce.com to fund myself

2952
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:48,768
In the past Alex's advertise for

2953
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:50,048
The Israeli

2954
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:52,096
Ministry of Tourism

2955
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:55,168
While he was saying negative things about Israel on air

2956
02:36:55,424 --> 02:37:01,568
For the most high family ministry a literal cult

2957
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:04,384
This is such nonsense

2958
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:10,784
And right now he knows he's about to unveil on-air that he's a multi-level marketing guide

2959
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:17,184
I can't I won't sell poison to

2960
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,720
To my audience

2961
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,144
Is

2962
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,424
Exactly why it's point

2963
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:28,448
Interview Alex

2964
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,472
He pushed back

2965
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:35,360
Exactly how he showed up

2966
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:42,784
Alright I'm going to another level and it's crazy because he

2967
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,648
F****** drunk as s*** here is not going

2968
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:48,672
That penetration

2969
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,720
He's going to say things that are super

2970
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:52,512
Feeling like that Nazi

2971
02:37:52,768 --> 02:37:54,816
He's not going to let you understand

2972
02:37:55,584 --> 02:38:00,704
I love money yeah yeah cuz even as f***** up with you if you knows the cameras are on

2973
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:02,240
Right so

2974
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:07,616
So here's the game at the end of this interview

2975
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:09,920
Like I didn't see this coming at all

2976
02:38:10,432 --> 02:38:11,968
This is the awesomest thing

2977
02:38:12,224 --> 02:38:13,760
Then you could ever do

2978
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:16,320
I will give Patrick bet-david

2979
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:18,880
All the credit in the world for this

2980
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:21,184
I'm going to give you a wart a name

2981
02:38:21,696 --> 02:38:22,976
And you tell me two person

2982
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,792
Georg little bit longer than the person that comes

2983
02:38:26,816 --> 02:38:27,584
That your brain is at

2984
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,400
First one

2985
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:32,960
Now

2986
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:34,752
Yes I'll tell you in advance

2987
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:36,032
These are not words

2988
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:37,568
These are people's necks

2989
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:43,968
So he's going to say people's names and then Alex's going to say the first word that comes to his mind all right I will play

2990
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:45,248
The person's name

2991
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:46,272
Deposit

2992
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,552
Have you have to guess

2993
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:50,112
What is Alex's response

2994
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,904
Edward Snowden

2995
02:38:54,464 --> 02:38:57,792
Who do you think is going to say

2996
02:38:59,072 --> 02:38:59,584
Patriot

2997
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:08,032
Iraq

2998
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:09,056
Are you the next one

2999
02:39:09,824 --> 02:39:10,336
Ted Cruz

3000
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:20,576
Alright

3001
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:22,112
Julian Assange

3002
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:25,952
Patron

3003
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:32,352
Super Bowl today

3004
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,192
Bernie Sanders

3005
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:40,544
Vampire

3006
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:46,944
Close

3007
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:48,992
Putin

3008
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:58,464
I don't I don't I don't

3009
02:39:58,720 --> 02:40:01,792
Probably. I don't want to

3010
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:03,072
But the

3011
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:04,352
He does choose

3012
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:07,680
From all of our understanding of his feelings about Putin

3013
02:40:07,936 --> 02:40:08,960
You should be able to guess

3014
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:13,312
Haha

3015
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:26,112
Take a break from the negative

3016
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:28,416
This next one. There's no way for me to pause it

3017
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,744
So you just have to hear

3018
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:36,352
Beto Beto is the one that's going to get pissed.

3019
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:41,728
I would definitely have gotten to -1 on that one

3020
02:40:42,752 --> 02:40:44,800
Arabic

3021
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:51,200
Criminal

3022
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,480
Wow

3023
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:57,600
Even all the legitimate complaints he could maybe have

3024
02:40:58,624 --> 02:41:01,952
Indicate your brain not operating on a really high level

3025
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:03,232
Here's the next one

3026
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:04,768
Bill Gates

3027
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:09,632
You might be able to get this one too

3028
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:11,680
Jealous

3029
02:41:12,192 --> 02:41:18,336
Part of the globalist plan but perhaps not

3030
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:25,504
4 - 4 no maybe

3031
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
Elon Musk

3032
02:41:27,552 --> 02:41:29,088
Elon Musk

3033
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,136
You know what

3034
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:31,904
Eugenicist

3035
02:41:34,208 --> 02:41:34,976
Scared man

3036
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:44,960
So far

3037
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:52,896
Self-destructive

3038
02:41:56,992 --> 02:41:57,504
LeBron James

3039
02:41:58,272 --> 02:41:59,296
Oh no

3040
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:00,832
Oh no

3041
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,368
Oh no

3042
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:13,376
I don't think that girl

3043
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:18,496
Not much not much better

3044
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:30,272
That's code that zip code

3045
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:33,088
Also by the way

3046
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:40,512
Interesting because

3047
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:42,304
Patrick bet-david

3048
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:48,704
Accidentally psychoanalysis his response

3049
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,728
Like that's racist

3050
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:54,080
You're getting racist

3051
02:42:54,848 --> 02:42:56,640
Colin Kaepernick

3052
02:42:56,896 --> 02:42:57,408
What do you think

3053
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:06,112
I quit this game I'm going to retire with the Warriors record in history actually don't care

3054
02:43:15,584 --> 02:43:16,096
Trader

3055
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:33,248
Shockingly

3056
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,040
No one else labeled

3057
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:39,904
All the people before that

3058
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:43,744
But also one of the reasons the phaedo is most

3059
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,280
Irrelevant Alex's

3060
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:48,096
He is someone who is standing up and saying

3061
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:48,864
That

3062
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:50,400
The police are killing black people

3063
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:51,424
And that is unacceptable

3064
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:58,336
Did Alex word compartmentalize Beto into part of his brain deals with I am racing

3065
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,360
Right so

3066
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:00,384
You're the next one

3067
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,408
You might be able to get this one

3068
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:03,200
Steve Bannon

3069
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:04,992
Patriots

3070
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:13,184
Trader Trader Trader personally

Text to Alex okay

3072
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:18,816
I think you stopped keeping score

3073
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:21,376
David Brock

3074
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:25,216

3076
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:31,616
Vampire vampire

3077
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:47,232
Hillary Clinton

Okay

3079
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,864
He's going to I'm going to go with

3080
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:55,680
Amigos like a vampire

3081
02:44:55,936 --> 02:44:56,704
Or something like that

3082
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:03,104
Like a level above like Serranos

3083
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:12,576
Hillary Clinton

3084
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:19,488
To give you half

3085
02:45:19,744 --> 02:45:20,256
Okay fine

3086
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:21,792
-4 1/2 Rock Obama

3087

Just a vampire

3088
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:26,912
For a third time

3089
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:31,008
Really don't want to say

3090
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:35,104
The r word

3091
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:39,968
You know what I'm just going to stick with vampire let's go then

3092
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:59,168
I'mma tell you right now.

3093
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:00,448
Make this respect

3094
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:02,752
Bush

3095
02:46:03,008 --> 02:46:04,543
He doesn't specify which bush

3096
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:06,591
But I would

3097
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:13,503
I've narrowed it down to

3098
02:46:13,759 --> 02:46:19,903
Let me give you my thoughts on

3099
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:22,463
Could be traitor because he does want to say vampire because

3100
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:23,743
Is the bush isn't like

3101
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:24,767
Part of the globe

3102
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:32,191
Not like the same part of the Lego no no no no

3103
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:40,127
Okay

3104
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:43,455
Because now the reason that I was going to go with vampire in the first place

3105
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:45,247
Cuz I feel like at this point

3106
02:46:45,503 --> 02:46:49,343
He is lazy in those two

3107
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:50,111
Maxim

3108
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:51,903
Vampire

3109
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:06,495
My favorite thing we've ever done

3110
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,127
Trump

3111
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:18,015
This is again

3112
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:20,831
He's the obvious answer is like Patriot

3113
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:22,879
But now I want it

3114
02:47:23,647 --> 02:47:24,159
To be like

3115
02:47:24,415 --> 02:47:28,511
He's got to step it up a bit

3116
02:47:29,023 --> 02:47:30,047
I'm just going to go with

3117
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:34,655

02:48:00,511 --> 02:48:01,023
Trouble

3128
02:48:02,303 --> 02:48:03,327
Elaborate would invite

3129
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:06,143
The real freaking day of my God knows it

3130
02:48:06,911 --> 02:48:07,679
All clear

3131
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,983
He's probably Emily wants progress

3132
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:13,311
He is one of just he's alright everything these

3133
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:18,431
I guess they call that deliver

3134
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:21,247
Crumbs to deliver

3135
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:23,551
We've already seen it

3136
02:48:24,063 --> 02:48:25,855
Already seen everything suppressor

3137
02:48:29,183 --> 02:48:29,951
Flowers

3138
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:32,511
Everything's waiting right

3139
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:35,583
What is Moses

3140
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:38,655
Which kind of leads

3141
02:48:38,911 --> 02:48:40,447
Believe that the Promised Land

3142
02:48:40,703 --> 02:48:41,471
Feel that you're bi

3143
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:42,239
Being lead

3144
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:44,799
Out of Egypt

3145
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:47,615
The things that have been happening

3146
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:49,663
Thank you sayings

3147
02:48:52,479 --> 02:48:53,247
There's only one

3148
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:58,623
Especially especially if you are a

3149
02:48:59,135 --> 02:49:01,183
And your ideas that you've brought grass

3150
02:49:01,695 --> 02:49:02,719
There's only one thing

3151
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:05,279
That he is made far more popular

3152
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:06,047
Ever was

3153
02:49:06,303 --> 02:49:08,607
Beforehand

3154
02:49:08,863 --> 02:49:09,375
King Sooper Pharmacy

3155
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,399
Fat bombs

3156
02:49:10,911 --> 02:49:12,191
It's f***** up

3157
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:13,983
Expected

3158
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:16,031
Accidentally revealed

3159
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:22,431
Doesn't realize what he's

3160
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:26,527
Alex's brain goes there is no sacrilege

3161
02:49:27,039 --> 02:49:27,807
A man also

3162
02:49:32,415 --> 02:49:35,487
It doesn't disturb his to this interview that he doesn't like

3163
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:37,023
Demand Alex

3164
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:40,351
Specifically like what do you mean by hold is

3165
02:49:43,423 --> 02:49:44,191
You're saying

3166
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:45,471
Either deliver

3167
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:47,263
He's going to lead us from what

3168
02:49:49,055 --> 02:49:50,591
Alex

3169
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:52,127
Into what

3170
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:55,967
Says that Trump is next level and then

3171
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:56,991
Patrick

3172
02:49:58,527 --> 02:50:00,063
I need to make clear that all of these other one

3173
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,855
There was no explanation

3174
02:50:03,135 --> 02:50:05,695
Cut it off after he said vampire

3175
02:50:05,951 --> 02:50:07,487
That was the only one that he's like

3176
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:08,255
What do you mean

3177
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:09,279
So

3178
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:11,327
But that's not

3179
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:12,095
Good

3180
02:50:12,351 --> 02:50:13,375
No

3181
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,655
Being alive

3182
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:20,287
No it was really fun and really ever happen

3183
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:23,103
Alex

3184
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:26,943
The only thing that happens after this is Patrick bet-david

3185
02:50:28,991 --> 02:50:31,551
We've talked to him you guys get to make your own decision

3186
02:50:31,807 --> 02:50:32,831
And throws it out to

3187
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:34,367
To the end this is Alex's lamp

3188
02:50:35,647 --> 02:50:36,415
You have to

3189
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:37,951
Humanity

3190
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:40,255
Do that everything else

3191
02:50:41,535 --> 02:50:43,839
So that's it.

3192
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:46,911
You guys a question over and over again

3193
02:50:47,679 --> 02:50:48,447
Is because I don't feel

3194
02:50:49,215 --> 02:50:50,495
I've already been around

3195
02:50:56,383 --> 02:50:57,151
That's scary

3196
02:50:57,663 --> 02:50:58,431
Cuz I'm not busy

3197
02:50:59,967 --> 02:51:00,479
Shut up

3198
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:04,063
FaceTime

3199
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:06,111
Paradox

3200
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:09,439
Sure

3201
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:10,975
Okay

3202
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:14,559
Cool call Rich Brazil yourself to be a

3203
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:16,351
Not apology

3204
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:19,167
Very racist religious zealot

3205
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:24,287
Why are you surprised the platforms don't want you on

3206
02:51:24,543 --> 02:51:27,615
When did we've already established that you exaggerate stuff

3207
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:29,151
Sensationalized

3208
02:51:29,407 --> 02:51:31,711
And you're very clearly as Patrick

3209
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:34,015
You are dangerous to naive mine

3210
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:35,551
So

3211
02:51:38,111 --> 02:51:42,719
Yep and that's why I have that sort of little piece of my brain that thinks this

3212
02:51:43,999 --> 02:51:45,535
Absolutely needs help

3213
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:50,655
Yeah and that's why it's really hard and I don't want to be in the present all that much because

3214
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:55,007
In the same way that I resist talking about project

3215
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:56,799
Clearly likes is manifesting

3216
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:58,847
Like this is yeah you need

3217
02:51:59,103 --> 02:52:01,151
To go you need to be hospitalized

3218
02:52:01,407 --> 02:52:04,479
I think we're getting to a point with Alex in 2018 where it's like

3219
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:05,503
This isn't funny

3220
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:06,783
This is this is

3221
02:52:07,039 --> 02:52:09,599
The crisis and the fact that no one is helping him

3222
02:52:09,855 --> 02:52:10,367
Is

3223
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:11,647
Like a disaster

3224
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:12,927
The ideas

3225
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:14,463
Patrick bet-david

3226
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:16,255
Allowed this out

3227
02:52:16,511 --> 02:52:18,815
Is kind of like I understand where you're coming from you want more

3228
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,863
But it's an irresponsible

3229
02:52:21,119 --> 02:52:22,655
Nothing in terms of Alex's mental

3230
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,447
This is a disservice to

3231
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:27,263
The fact that his dad is an HR

3232
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:28,031
Head

3233
02:52:28,287 --> 02:52:29,311
And doesn't tell him

3234
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:31,103
I need to lock you up

3235
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:33,919
Yeah you need to go to hospital

3236
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:34,943
Yeah

3237
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:37,759
Owen Shroyer

3238
02:52:38,271 --> 02:52:39,039
It doesn't say

3239
02:52:39,295 --> 02:52:39,807
You need help

3240
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:42,879
The fact that David Knight is been there for this long

3241
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:43,647
Deterioration

3242
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:44,671
It isn't like

3243
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:45,439
You need help

3244
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:46,975
The fact that Rodger Stone

3245
02:52:47,231 --> 02:52:47,999
Isn't staying

3246
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:48,767
You need

3247
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:50,815
Memes with no one around him is

3248
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,839
Is recognizing

3249
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:53,119
Very clear sign

3250
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:55,423
Did he is becoming a danger to his own

3251
02:52:56,959 --> 02:53:00,799
Recognizing it and realizing that it's

3252
02:53:01,055 --> 02:53:01,567
The best thing they can

3253
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:05,663
Make better for Rodger Stone than / Alex

3254
02:53:06,175 --> 02:53:08,223
Maybe for Rodger

3255
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:08,991
Yeah maybe

3256
02:53:09,247 --> 02:53:10,783
No

3257
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:16,415
I don't know what that sprayer

3258
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:21,535
I'm just actually around here

3259
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:22,815
Responsibility

3260
02:53:23,327 --> 02:53:23,839
Take care of him and

3261
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:27,423
Is their own aisle

3262
02:53:27,679 --> 02:53:30,751
You're an adult all that stuff

3263
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:32,031
Testing signs of like

3264
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:33,567
This is a breakdown

3265
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,103
This

3266
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:38,943
Is this interview is like is hilarious as it is at 4

3267
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:41,759
Like it's it's a it's a clear indication of it

3268
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,527
Deteriorating

3269
02:53:42,783 --> 02:53:46,623
Deteriorating mental state

3270
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:47,391
Continue down

3271
02:53:47,647 --> 02:53:48,159
Road

3272
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:49,951
Is liquid

3273
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:51,743
Forehead people Center

3274
02:53:52,767 --> 02:53:54,559
Because there were people around her who cares

3275
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:57,375
Yeah

3276
02:53:57,631 --> 02:54:02,239
Suggested the same thing is that so many people around her also invested in

3277
02:54:02,495 --> 02:54:08,639
Getting her and her flame out

3278
02:54:08,895 --> 02:54:13,247
Undeniable

3279
02:54:13,503 --> 02:54:15,039
Self-destructive tendencies

3280
02:54:15,295 --> 02:54:16,063
Are going to

3281
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:16,831
Person

3282
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:19,647
We care about anyone around Alex Jones

3283
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:20,927
I beg of Thee

3284
02:54:22,207 --> 02:54:23,231
Do what you need to do

3285
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:24,511
Cuz the next

3286
02:54:24,767 --> 02:54:25,535
Couple months

3287
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:26,559
After this

3288
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:28,095
Don't look

3289
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:28,863
Good

3290
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:31,423
Especially

3291
02:54:31,679 --> 02:54:32,703
Coordinate with the aftermath

3292
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:36,031
We don't have any idea

3293
02:54:36,287 --> 02:54:37,311
The idea that business

3294
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:39,359
He was before he introduced

3295
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:40,383
The MLM scheme

3296
02:54:41,151 --> 02:54:42,175
Before he's kicked off the

3297
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:42,943
Payment process

3298
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:45,247
Defected

3299
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:46,271
Was

3300
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:47,295
It reads

3301
02:54:47,807 --> 02:54:48,831
To believe that

3302
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:50,879
It's going to get worse

3303
02:54:51,903 --> 02:54:53,183
You have a responsibility

3304
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:54,463
Gift for kids

3305
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:56,511
One of them is under two years of age

3306
02:54:57,023 --> 02:54:59,071
This is not okay on a human level

3307
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,863
I hate to be preaching

3308
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:01,887
But these people

3309
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,423
Disservice

3310
02:55:03,679 --> 02:55:05,471
To the world and to other people

3311
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:09,567
How do you Broach that subject

3312
02:55:09,823 --> 02:55:12,127
When you put

3313
02:55:12,383 --> 02:55:15,455
I get that I mean like even for themselves

3314
02:55:15,711 --> 02:55:17,247
If you are Owen Shroyer

3315
02:55:17,503 --> 02:55:19,039
You can watch that and say

3316
02:55:19,295 --> 02:55:21,855
Well he's just defending what I believe it

3317
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:23,391
Thrones

3318
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:25,695
Jaime Lannister

3319
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:26,975
Beaverton player

3320
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:27,999
Or whatever

3321
02:55:28,255 --> 02:55:33,375
Be whatever you need to be

3322
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:35,679
Mythology around it if

3323
02:55:35,935 --> 02:55:36,447
You need to

3324
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:38,239
Owen Shroyer is the Young Gun

3325
02:55:39,263 --> 02:55:40,031
He can create

3326
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:43,359
Some sort of idea in his mind that I'm pure in

3327
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:44,383
Alex

3328
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:45,151
Is

3329
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:48,735
He's lost his way

3330
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:49,503
He's a danger to

3331
02:55:49,759 --> 02:55:50,527
People around him

3332
02:55:50,783 --> 02:55:51,807
I will do what I need to

3333
02:55:52,063 --> 02:55:52,831
To do as much as I

3334
02:55:53,855 --> 02:55:54,367
To do

3335
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:58,463
To make things okay

3336
02:55:59,999 --> 02:56:03,071
Like what do they see in that interview like we see was obvious

3337
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:06,399
No I mean a I think even if you take the content out of it

3338
02:56:06,655 --> 02:56:07,423
The presentation

3339
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:08,959
Clear aspect

3340
02:56:11,007 --> 02:56:11,519
But I'm ready

3341
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:14,591
When you need to

3342
02:56:18,431 --> 02:56:21,759
Let's say someone who I philosophically a mostly inline

3343
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:24,575
Let's heater or Michael Brook

3344
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:26,367
Yeah I saw an interview

3345
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:31,231
Like this with them and they were talking about like socialism

3346
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:33,279
Brother talking about the diversity

3347
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:36,863
Equality and they were presenting themselves like that I would say

3348
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:38,399
Get them to a f****** hops

3349
02:56:38,911 --> 02:56:39,935
They are okay

3350
02:56:40,191 --> 02:56:40,959
They're going to her

3351
02:56:41,727 --> 02:56:44,799
Weather in through an accident or their own hand

3352
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:45,823
It's not okay

3353
02:56:46,591 --> 02:56:48,127
What I would like today

3354
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:50,687
Is that

3355
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:52,479
We have all the evidence

3356
02:56:53,503 --> 02:56:54,271
Did Alex Jones

3357
02:56:55,551 --> 02:56:56,319
Is going down

3358
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:58,367
The deepest darkest path

3359
02:56:58,623 --> 02:56:59,647
There is available

3360
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:03,231
Yeah I think the Goldwater rule is thrown out the window after the

3361
02:57:06,047 --> 02:57:08,351
We don't have any professional response

3362
02:57:08,607 --> 02:57:10,399
People who need psychiatrist

3363
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:13,471
Which gives us a perspective

3364
02:57:13,727 --> 02:57:15,519
Me the psychiatrist

3365
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:19,103
Hillcrest Estates Pacific

3366
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:20,127
What the problem is

3367
02:57:23,199 --> 02:57:27,039
There is a f****** problem specifically what the problem is

3368
02:57:27,551 --> 02:57:28,319
It is big

3369
02:57:33,695 --> 02:57:34,207
No

3370
02:57:35,999 --> 02:57:37,279
I don't pray for Redemption

3371
02:57:41,631 --> 02:57:43,167
The only thing I hold out hope for

3372
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:44,191
Where is Alex Jones

3373
02:57:46,495 --> 02:57:47,263
So he can be there for

3374
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:50,847
Because that's really the only thing that matters

3375
02:57:51,615 --> 02:57:52,127
To us

3376
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:54,687
It doesn't matter to us in a real way

3377
02:57:54,943 --> 02:57:56,479
Write the reasons that it matters

3378
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:59,295
You don't deserve

3379
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:01,855
They don't deserve whatever is going

3380
02:58:02,111 --> 02:58:02,623
Happened next

3381
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:03,647
Dim Alex's

3382
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:05,951
Bizarre I'm going to blow up and

3383
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:10,815
Kill the New World Order near right right right

3384
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:12,863
Cuz when he got kicked off of

3385
02:58:13,119 --> 02:58:15,423
Stuff his immediate response was

3386
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:16,959
Go f*** with people in the streets

3387
02:58:17,215 --> 02:58:18,239
I'm going to go to washing

3388
02:58:22,847 --> 02:58:26,175
You going to escalate more

3389
02:58:26,431 --> 02:58:27,455
When I was

3390
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:29,247
My family was in

3391
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:32,575
Think about how much better a comedian.

3392
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:33,343
It will be because

3393
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,111
Is there

3394
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:35,135
They were born in the face

3395
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:36,159
Family with the Coco

3396
02:58:36,415 --> 02:58:42,559
Leader I've seen Rex doesn't have much jobs

3397
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:48,959
I don't know maybe we're going a little overboard

3398
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:52,799
Except there wasn't

3399
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:54,335
It does come off a little bit I think

3400
02:58:54,591 --> 02:58:55,103
If possible for some

3401
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:57,151
Me being like

3402
02:58:57,663 --> 02:59:01,247
Grandstand

3403
02:59:01,503 --> 02:59:06,623
I don't know all of the coverage of like new

3404
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:08,159
Media Matters wasn't like

3405
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:14,815
More like Alex Jones reveals again why he needs psychiatric help Lego

3406
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:15,583
We all just

3407
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:21,727
If we all just let all of our other stuff go like we've already proved you're a f****** races

3408
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:24,799
Now we need to get everybody on board with you going and see

3409
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:25,823
Somebody wanted

3410
02:59:28,383 --> 02:59:30,943
I always liked battle rap

3411
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:32,479
When I was younger

3412
02:59:36,575 --> 02:59:37,343
And stuff like that

3413
02:59:37,599 --> 02:59:38,367
And always

3414
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:39,903
Kind of like

3415
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:40,671
When there

3416
02:59:40,927 --> 02:59:42,463
Well laid out

3417
02:59:43,487 --> 02:59:43,999
Personal

3418
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:49,119
There's there's a lot of examples

3419
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:51,167
But I always thought

3420
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:52,191
The most potent

3421
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:53,215
Diss track

3422
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:54,239
Ever heard

3423
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:55,519
Was Ms Grimm

3424
02:59:55,775 --> 02:59:56,543
Is the Book of Daniel

3425
02:59:56,799 --> 02:59:57,823
When you wrote this

3426
02:59:58,079 --> 02:59:59,359
About MF Doom

3427
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:00,383
And how am I doing

3428
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:01,407
Lost his way

3429
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:02,431
Right

3430
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:05,503
The track that you'd made after you've gotten out of prison

3431
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:08,575
And you made it with the Monster Island czars

3432
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:11,903
That were their old crew when they were coming up

3433
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:14,719
And the entire District isn't like you suck

3434
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:15,743
It's all

3435
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:16,511
I love you

3436
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:18,815
Why did you do this to ya

3437
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:20,863
Yes

3438
03:00:21,119 --> 03:00:21,887
One of them

3439
03:00:22,143 --> 03:00:22,911
Doom Song

3440
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:24,447
He talked about like how are you

3441
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:25,471
It was part of a group

3442
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:26,239
Called me jacinta

3443
03:00:27,007 --> 03:00:31,103
Like making fun of m i c

3444
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:31,871
Everett

3445
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:34,431
And the whole song

3446
03:00:34,687 --> 03:00:36,223
Is just a laying out of their history

3447
03:00:36,735 --> 03:00:37,247
About how like

3448
03:00:37,503 --> 03:00:38,271
I thought you gross

3449
03:00:40,831 --> 03:00:41,855
I would take a bullet

3450
03:00:43,903 --> 03:00:44,671
Why would you ever

3451
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:47,487
And in the end of the song

3452
03:00:47,999 --> 03:00:49,279
Home home

3453
03:00:49,535 --> 03:00:50,303
Yeah I love you

3454
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:53,631
Prodigal Son

3455
03:00:53,887 --> 03:00:54,399
Much more

3456
03:00:55,935 --> 03:00:56,959
Like a disc

3457
03:00:57,215 --> 03:00:57,983
Then just like

3458
03:00:58,239 --> 03:00:59,263
You suck

3459
03:00:59,519 --> 03:01:00,799
Yeah

3460
03:01:02,335 --> 03:01:03,871
That's the spirit I want to come to LA

3461
03:01:04,127 --> 03:01:05,663
Not that I love you

3462
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:06,943
But you need help

3463
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:08,479

Anyway that's the only way to wrap up the show

Stop indeed but Dan before we go

3479
03:01:48,159 --> 03:01:49,951
It's hard to be sympathetic for Alex

3480
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:52,255
Because there's one piece of information that you

3481
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:53,791
What is that

3482
03:01:54,815 --> 03:01:56,607
Audi

3483
03:01:57,375 --> 03:01:59,679
