Have a little bit of novelty

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
Jordan is currently on vacation in Iceland

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,904
I'm so filling in as replacement Jordan one of my dear friends

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
Hilarious metrics

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048

Crush powder singles to go as you mention soda and I gave him so two years ago

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
And I was like what I wanted this shity

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,456
I meant to say it could be a soda or a juice or something like that

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Send a text message

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
I live right next to a CVS

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
I don't give a

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
Too much information

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
CVS and I just

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Too lazy to leave

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
My lady friend went

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672

Firehouse

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,304
Chicago nearest CVS and agile

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
Not narrow it down at all

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Beverage thing

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,056
Never had a powdered beverage on the show and its

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Although

27
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
We have to stir it with the powder thing within the powder cumin and I've noticed they don't tell the people out there that I don't

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
I have spoons at the ready

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
That's fair

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
It starts to like

31
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Come back into Lake

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
Pizza

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Is it the end

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,984
I'm excited to do something

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Cinepolis

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,272

By going

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488

Today we're going to be talking about the August 9th

46
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Episode that was Wednesday

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
The Alex Jones Show

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
Except

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,232
Before we started recording you told me you don't know pretty much anything about our

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
No I mean I

51
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
Wow

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
Amazing by where I live

53
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
CVS

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,104
The Infowars sticker there was a guy at my job

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Was a big fan of Alex Jones

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Okay

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
He's adding a longer with us but not related

58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
I don't think I hope not

59
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Done got him

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Mental Illness but

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Avengers

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Pop culture related

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
It's a man through you

64
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Sure

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,280
I spout a lot

66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
Samsung

67
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
10 minutes of your podcast about all anyone ever really needs military

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Listen

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,008
The two hours of this

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
Shirts general rule of thumb

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:29,920
Fill you in let's get to experience

72
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
The rocky road that is Alex Jones

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
This August 9th episode is pretty

74
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:41,184
I think that we've chosen a good one to throw you in the deep end of a kitty pool

75
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
What is a lie I feel pretty

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
Sure

77
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:52,960
No no no I thought maybe he was part of the span of all the other stuff around the present

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
Knowing the reality is not going to help you here

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,456
Alright for sure on the news that is broken

80
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
In terms of the situation

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
North Korea

82
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
Paul manafort's house

83
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Those are two things are going to come up but

84
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Knowing the facts

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Isn't going to give you context for what Alex

86
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Yeah I know that

87
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
Let's Jump Right In

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
Is in a weird mood

89
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
On this side is August

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Episode

91
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Because of the situation with North Korea

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
The idea of

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Threatening a nuclear war or nuclear Brinks

94
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,159
Obviously he's going to put any parent in a weird head

95
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Exploration

96
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
Merkel order Trump speech

97
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
It's Donald Trump's fault

98
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
How old is Donald Trump

99
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
Warzone

100
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,391
And a little smidgen

101
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
North Korea

102
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
So he's not an apology

103
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,007
I don't know how he has the rights to Lottery song

104
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
But there's a lot of artists

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Clearly wood

106
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
F****** hate

107
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
People like Moby

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,711
The Beatles on their butt

109
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Carpenters website

110
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,927
Package contract with a

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,303
I have no idea what it is but it seems very weird.

112
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
What's that weird Leaf it's although it does

113
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Yeah yeah

114
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
So I like this

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Because it's a nice basic

116
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
It sort of

117
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,079
It's just Alex being like

118
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
Why can't Trump do with Kim Jeong Hoon does it all the time

119
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
Because we're not petulant children were supposed to be the adults

120
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,879
Reasonable perspective on it

121
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
And because

122
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Of course

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
They always do

124
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
And the reason that there's a status quo is because

125
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
We don't

126
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
How things get out of control is

127
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
You can have a really stable

128
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
But once

129
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
The disaster not want there to be War

130
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,759
If they do shoot at Guam I'm excited to learn more about Guam

131
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Is it convenient

132
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
I would say read up now

133
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
So this

134
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,047
Is going to this this idea of the potential nuclear war

135
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
Is going to kick Alex Jones off into

136
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,423
8 incredibly f***** up rant

137
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
That takes up about 10 minutes of the first hour of his

138
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,847
I want to see this this next clip is about 12 minutes

139
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Into the show

140
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
And when he's

141
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
Going into this sort of stuff this early on the show

142
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
You know

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
We're get worrying for a

144
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
So here is the Alex Jones talking about

145
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Humanity I think

146
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Not entirely sure how to set this up but you'll see

147
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,327
I should probably just walk over the world map

148
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Section-by-section here of the continents in the country

149
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
He could have been

150
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
PowerPoint

151
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
And show people in jail

152
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
He's been saying he's going to build a new TV studio for about the last

153
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
2 years

154
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
And it is not materialized

155
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
Making a million-dollar Studio

156
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
And this whole idea if I can go with laser

157
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
Are Pointers and point out that

158
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
Do you want a rainbow board nonsense but it be a physical perform

159
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
That is not that certainly not as much by volume

160
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,711
I like Shep Smith from Fox

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Lucas seems like the only sane person

162
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Maybe Mike walls okay

163
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
They have these giant iPads

164
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
Yet it just looks like an iPad and I'm like what

165
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
You just like f****** Minority Report

166
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,239
No it's the technological like a bull s*** that they're doing

167
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,055
Wolf Blitzer had a f****** hologram on it

168
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
Go back to Cronkite days

169
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Alex Jones

170
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Has not gotten to explain about Humanity Justice

171
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
Properly.

172
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Because on screen

173
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
That are pedophiles

174
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,223
Like that

175
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,551
Bike shop

176
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:33,183
Speciesism

177
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Information

178
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
Understanding epigenetics

179
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
We know where is an

180
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
We all know we can build

181
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
Now we're sitting here

182
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
On the face of this whole thing

183
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Subspace colonies

184
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
Unlimited

185
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,799
Charge

186
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
So this is what I would like

187
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,223
To say this is the beginning of a meltdown that's about to happen live on

188
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
I'd like to

189
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Open the floor for Quest

190
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Could you look confused

191
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,439
It's because I don't have the background of him before he kind of jumped into politics

192
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Text bright

193
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Talking about

194
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
The crazy in my PIN

195
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,871
Easy stuff like that he was into years ago was like a lot of

196
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
New World Order stuff there's a lot of 911 stuff

197
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Sure I don't

198
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Sandy Hook sure

199
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Even political

200
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
Conspiracy

201
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Blue Boy

202
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,951
Essentially like

203
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Real

204
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Bulshit

205
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Pseudoscience

206
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
Its bordering on ancient alien

207
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
That's what he's getting into here

208
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
Humans have a memory of being off

209
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Planet

210
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Stuff like that like

211
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,823
We used to be in the Stars we used to be like

212
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Traveling through space but all that memories been erased

213
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
By the global

214
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,503
Do they want us to think that were a fallen people

215
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
It's basically that whole thing

216
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Yeah

217
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,463
Ice cream

218
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,583
You'll see a lot of stuff that is from pop culture pop-up and his rhetoric

219
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Don't worry about that references movies all the f***

220
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Time cool

221
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,263
I wish you would have been

222
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
Cuz it couldn't have been more clear

223
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
So

224
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Like I said this is the beginning of a breakdown

225
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Is a little bit of a meltdown on air

226
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Just tell you it's a

227
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
It's a bizarre

228
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Rant

229
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
Cut-out nothing

230
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
From it

231
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
But I've cut it in

232
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Two segments

233
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,047
So I sort of switches in the rain

234
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
I've I've made a cut that I've got nothing else

235
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Out I've not

236
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Context of this at all

237
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Earlier that you think

238
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Because he has children

239
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
No I think that the

240
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,919
He would like to present it as like the nuclear threat is scarier for him because he has children

241
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,271
He does bring that up, father I don't want it I don't want nuclear war that's

242
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
He's based out of Texas Austin

243
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Show me right now just with North Korea

244
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Define latex

245
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,375
If you listen to Alex if I'm not sure if that's

246
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
But

247
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Kim Jeong Hoon hate sxsw

248
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
Comedy

249
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
I don't know what the truth

250
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
And what the rumors are about

251
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
They're actually

252
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
DNR range

253
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,559
But Alex thinks that they can hit Austin they can in Chicago

254
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
He basically thinks they can hit the entire United

255
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
So he's pretty scared

256
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
And it leads

257
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Pretty strongly into this ramp

258
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
So let's let's jump into this

259
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Kill

260
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Whatever it is charged

261
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,527
Sing in charge wants to take microchip

262
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
Define shall Domino's

263
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,183
Is building worldwide AI system of computers

264
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
It's three-dimensional image

265
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
In tube

266
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
The seats of power into the

267
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Malls

268
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
End of the Town squares

269
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
What's up

270
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
Being in control of everything certainly

271
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:21,183
You're coming from me and Jordan have realized is that like arguments

272
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Sort of hinge on hypocrisy

273
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Are a little bit useless

274
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Just because

275
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Especially Alex's version the right don't give a

276
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Push it

277
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
Like spoiler alert

278
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
He's going to Advocate later in this episode for regime-change

279
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
North Korea

280
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,407
Meanwhile he complains about how do you know the globalist

281
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
Committed

282
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
I'm taking over and stuff like that

283
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
What do you do

284
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,391
Where is your base where's your moral base in terms of

285
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Oh it's fine as long as the globalists aren't doing it

286
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
People that went to my church at

287
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583

Tucker Rida new song

291
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
The fear that is the the Antichrist it's just that

292
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Interpreting

293

Bring the mark of the beast

295
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
It's need for buying a

Selling

Rexel

299
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
We would watch it late night Christmas

300
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
The guy who looks like Ricardo Montalban

301
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
That's right rexella

302
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,615
Guys if you've never received Jack Van Impe

303
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431

Social social network

305
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Alright

306
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,767
We're going to order something from Amazon before we do

307
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
But it won't be

308
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,127
With five Daddy's R5 mommies

309
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Cuz you can have a human

310
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
Innocence system can only be humanoid

311
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
The crime will be being male female

312
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
The crime will be male and female in Union

313
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
Revolution

314
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,119
In the free love of men and women and then once they had you there by successive approximation

315
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
They walk you into the gates of hell

316
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Bastard

317
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,847
I've been having free love my whole life

318
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
But that's just a fear of people put into slightly different language

319
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
And there was someone else there was a lady

320
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
In no way affect

321
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,839
That's crazy you are so you are so deep globalist rabbit-hole

322
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,471
Sears

323
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,639
Great things going to come is unlimited cloning

324
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
I'd like the limited clothing we have now

325
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,087
He's up on this idea that like the globalist want to

326
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Make

327
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
May 11th

328
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,903
Female bad

329
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
And that's why they're creating like

330
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
He believes that they're making people

331
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Want to be

332
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
Friends by tricking them when their children

333
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,911
And stuff like that okay

334
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
He's off on some

335
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
The wild shape

336
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
Just rhetoric from someone

337
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Who's constantly on

338
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Like

339
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
Live a real life

340
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Just like think

341
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
What's rhetoric

342
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
From someone who gets most of their information from like Reddit I think that a lot of his

343
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
His scoops

344
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
And his Anonymous sources

345
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Are Reddit posts

346
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
10-4 chance Duffin

347
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Just like that

348
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
So I think it does

349
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,631
I think it informs him a lot but then at the same time I think he is aware that that's who is Audie

350
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
So you know people who are

351
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Caught up in

352
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Okay if you will

353
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
Because I

354
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,479
I'm not a huge fan I don't donate money but I tend to watch

355
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
The clips of The Young Turks

356
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
And my fear was coming in with like that

357
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Dusty Jake fella

358
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Was going to be like the

359
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Progressive version of Alex Jones

360
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
Progressive Fox News

361
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
But now that I've heard the first 10 minutes of it

362
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
I'm fine

363
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,495
I like the idea of like

364
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,311
Is there a less version of Alex

365
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,383
Yeah and the closest we can come is kind of Keith Olbermann

366
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Okay not as crazy

367
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
But he is unhinged

368
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
Who's performing

369
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Yeah scream zabaneh

370
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
He has sources

371
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
And the way he talks is very similar to episodes of Ancient Aliens

372
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Play Zayn

373
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah

374
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Is I've noticed that molasse

375
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
Yeah yeah

376
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
It's not great but it's no like

377
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,751
There's no one like

378
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Like this anywhere

379
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
Alex Jones

380
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Except for

381
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
Possibly in like a snake charming Church

382
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
In Appalachia

383
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
Those people that would come into the Hardee's I worked at at

384
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
9:30 on a Sunday night in Knox

385
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Clean up after those

386
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Fairyloot

387
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Business

388
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
His rent goes on

389
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
It's not

390
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Just about

391
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
The sexual Revolution

392
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Leaving us from

393
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
How about

394
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
How about we

395
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
You know

396
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
Trick you into it

397
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Saxers

398
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
But

399
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
I mean

400
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Bears

401
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,855
Bigger thing of foot

402
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,951
Cuz there is there are binary there's not just

403
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Two genders and you switch

404
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Spell someone

405
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Switches to

406
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,351
The one that's how they feel they are

407
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
I mean I guess that is the case

408
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Sometimes

409
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Intersex

410
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
Spoke those

411
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,055
There's a whole range that are available to people

412
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Alex

413
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
I was just like there was some days where I'm at

414
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
BJ's and there's some days where I'm at

415
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Wants to watch Predator like I just

416
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
Figured that's how much

417
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,975
I'm having fun

418
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:52,351
Open free Society

419
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
They can successfully

420
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Waukesha

421
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
Cultural and species

422
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Wizard

423
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,479
Or just the humans

424
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
Everything will be defiled

425
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
Everything

426
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,744
Everything will be deformed every single be made

427
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
For Destruction

428
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,496
Before the force is allowed to finally kill everything on the planet

429
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,872
Because of free will the life must be turned upside down and must

430
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
It's delivery

431
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
But it will never get that far

432
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,024
Because God will spare flesh but if God didn't intervene there would be no flesh there

433
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
What you look very confused

434
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,192
Stories very religious

435
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah

436
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,544
What's the other globalist

437
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
From the New World Order

438
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,968
I feel like it's about to start a heavy metal band

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
Heavy metal bands

440
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
I would put clips of him talk

441
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Skin before my songs

442
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,696
Good it's just f****** nonsense

443
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
Crazy

444
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
It's like listening to Rush Limbaugh I don't agree with them

445
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:43,456
As much as I do you start to get setup with the tricks

446
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
To make the show

447
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,232
Our first episode that was one of the two things you wanted to make clear off the bat

448
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
One is that

449
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,352
We don't want Alex Jones kicked off the air that's not our agenda

450
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
We are just trying to document how much of

451
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
A bigot and a liar

452
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
And then the other thing

453
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
Say what you want about him

454
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Have a lot of

455
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,336
Yeah the ability

456
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
To just freestyle rap this s***

457
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
For like 20 minutes

458
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
It's unbelievable

459
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Why

460
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Spirit

461
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Basically and now he's revealed

462
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
In the middle of this rant

463
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
But God's got a spare some of that

464
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,680
We take a turn towards

465
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Old Walmarts

466
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,360
Tension cabs now hold on

467
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
It's complicated

468
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Because Alex

469
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
About that

470
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
Stop

471
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
I'm back in back in 2015

472
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
That he thought it was a government takeover

473
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
And I can find

474
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,840
No real evidence that he's lying about that he said it was just trying to

475
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,936
Just like the public out and get them ready for the eventual military takeover

476
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
It's like

477
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Basically

478
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,080
Fight on what episode some guy did call and say that he saw saw

479
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
People

480
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,920
In Walmart and

481
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
That's how you got a cell phone taken away for taking a picture

482
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:27,136
I'm flying out tomorrow

483
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Half bear half knot

484
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
Yeah but you definitely said Sandy Hook was fake

485
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
He definitely thinks

486
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,816
That almost all mass shooting

487
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,632
That the victims aren't White

488
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Sardar fake

489
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
Yeah it's that he's a very big

490
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Boise Idaho

491
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Guy

492
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,872
What happens now that there's literally

493
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
Like each side or whatever you believe on

494
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
There's enough

495
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,808
You mean these photos like denial of Truth

496
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Follow the path that you want to believe in

497
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Instead of having

498
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
To be faced with

499
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
The truth or

500
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
With other

501
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,304
Currently leads to confrontation confrontation

502
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Be peaceful and fact-based

503
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Like conversation

504
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
I know that's laughable

505
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
It's going to end up with malicious

506
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
Okay

507
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
I don't see any way that the

508
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
It don't matter what happens

509
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Is Trump really

510
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Let me get Dawes on the world stage

511
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
F****** nuke somebody

512
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
That's the problem

513
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
But in terms of our country's stability

514
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
I mean he doesn't matter in the sense that even if he's impeached

515
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
We still got a big problem on our

516
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,720
All right white nationalist

517
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
Fringe

518
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
There's been empowered and

519
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Emboldened

520
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Is not going to just go away

521
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
I'm just glad I'm a white male that didn't graduate college

522
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,336
You're right in their demo

523
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,944
I can't imagine it will be difficult the very very easy headspace

524
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
To get into

525
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:02,880
Chips Trucking people who aren't straight white

526
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Just find a way to make

527
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
All right here's the next part of the

528
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,864
You're going to look back on these days as happy day

529
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
Halcyon

530
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
You're going to look back on this time

531
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Screwing around playing video games

532
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Your destiny not feeling fulfilled

533
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,720
I'll look back and you are going to beg on your knees God

534
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:47,424
But you never would have done the things you did those give it serve this but you're going to realize you don't

535
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,288
Deception in the end because you went too far and you spit the face life

536
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,336
Everything good

537
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,176
And you're going to turn and go

538
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
The direction you meant you were

539
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Destin to go

540
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Because it's what you chose

541
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
That is

542
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
Spiritual

543
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Cultural

544
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Oblivion

545
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
The force of Oblivion

546
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
Willing itself to death

547
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,848
William shelter suicide broadcast

548
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:36,576
Tornado

549
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
Rally's

550
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Stop at Trump's perfect

551
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,216
Idea of magic

552
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Albumin Majesty

553
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,664
Image of God that's Majesty

554
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
That's wild stuff

555
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
That's very

556
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Because it's

557
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
It's such a f*****-up thing

558
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,064
Because

559
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
Ever

560
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Since United States existed

561
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
We've had multiple political parties

562
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Yeah people have a great and they've Disick

563
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Yep going to happen forever

564
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
But now it's

565
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Being Twisted into these waves

566
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,216
More than just political problem it's just now it's now it's

567
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
God that was all this stuff

568
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
And people that listen to this

569
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,080
I accepted Jesus into my heart

570
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:36,480
Late night

571
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
My family and I would have no food because

572
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
I'm about to get my head cut off of the guillotine

573
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
Movie when I was 13

574
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
But if you're

575
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Like they're just going to that's their normal

576
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Yeah it's hot.

577
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,384
Feel so horrible

578
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
Yeah

579
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
Obviously don't

580
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Teaching

581
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,400
Well I mean I think you bring up a good point though that is important

582
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
And that is better

583
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,008
The idea that political arguments have happened for hundreds

584
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
The years and it's been

585
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,688
Rarely

586
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
Alex's conception of the world is that there are globalist

587
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:52,000
Who want to create a one world government that will bring about the antique

588
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,560
Andy's globalists are

589
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Suspiciously always

590
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
The Democrat

591
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
But also the Republican

592
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
He doesn't like

593
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,056
Who are Libertarians are working for the globalist also

594
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
Like he was

595
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,200
Republican before that he was a weird libertarian

596
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,528
Conservative Republican

597
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Head to his credit he hated George Bush

598
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
George h.w. Bush

599
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
As it were

600
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
He was very very critical of George W bush

601
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
And you know

602
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,632
Sort of gives him the appearance of

603
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
Impartiality

604
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
But the reality is he just decided the George W bush work for

605
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
The globalist

606
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,032
I am so f******

607
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,872
And then that makes it impossible to have a real argument politically

608
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Is that

609
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
If you're arguing against

610
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Alex Jones's worldview

611
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
That you are

612
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
By default arguing in favor of the globalist

613
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
Who want to create a government and bring about the

614
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
Who may or may not be Brock

615
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
Hussein Obama

616
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
What's it going to do

617
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
Well Larry Nichols

618
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,888
This guy who's on Alex's show a bunch

619
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,960
In the lead-up to the election was saying that

620
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,288
What they were going to do Obama was going to

621
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
Screw over Hillary Clinton

622
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,896
Obama leaks all the stuff about the server

623
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:13,920
In order to

624
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
Destroy her is a candidate

625
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
So that Joe Biden could win

626
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,808
And then I think what he was saying

627
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,392
Is it Obama would become the Secretary General of the UN

628
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,208
And turn the us into a Muslim caliphate

629
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,280
So Obama could be the president of Muslims worldwide

630
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,912
The country that Muslim we're just going to get the

631
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
Yeah so that was that's the fear that they have about it

632
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
It's all

633
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,592
If me saying these things sounds like nonsense

634
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,968
And they preach it to however million

635
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
The millions of people listen

636
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,320
Let everyone know

637
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
Probably that you're probably

638
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,160
Preaching to the choir with field Elizabeth I

639
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
I guess I don't know I don't know what you listen

640
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
What I mean is I don't know how many people might actually like houses or believe what he says or how many

641
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
People are just like those guys

642
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
Diagram of people who like us and people who like Alex Jones are two circles

643
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
Hangover

644
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
I just want to tell you I almost want a t-shirt

645
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Obama

646
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Happy president

647
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,480
Like he's just going to be a dude

648
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,320
That's just comes around the room

649
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,928
Cuz I was drunk believe that you set up a command bunker a block away from the White House

650
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,256
My name is George Soros are creating shock troops

651
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,328
President-trump

652
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
The greatest American president of all time low

653
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,008
Was that been sad

654
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
Oh my God

655
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,640
I don't think George Washington would want to say that political rhetoric

656
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
But

657
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Yeah I do

658
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
How high do you have to

659
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
To be like where does it talk about

660
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,600
I think

661
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
It's one part brain damage

662
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
We've documented a couple incidents

663
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Cosmo

664
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Brain damage

665
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
If he's telling the truth about the

666
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:10,656
A couple of traumatic bashing his head into concrete when he was a child

667
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
I'm horrible but

668
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,288
How to go to the other side

669
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,592
Dial

670
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:23,968
But then also you got stuck under house inhaling fumes

671
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
In the future

672
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:33,952
Imma kill you I don't know I guess you would take that I'm a Jewish sympathizer so

673
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,512
And I'm across I do so I'm not perfect

674
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
No I'm not part of the master race

675
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
Anyway

676
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,984
But we're not nearly done with this

677
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,544
Asthma thing goes a lot

678
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,432
I'm the primary by people if they've just started like I'm the voice of the guy that does not

679
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,088
Short sentences what the f*** is going on

680
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
I enjoy that

681
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,392
So please feel free

682
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
To let your questions

683
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
GameFly

684
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
And there's just a

685
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,984
Tell right there

686
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
The horns of the Earth

687
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,424
Don't wanna reprieve

688
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:50,240
We want

689
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
What Jonah

690
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
What

691
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,736
Don't want Moses

692
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,112
We don't want any other

693
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
Is the weather

694
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
Because we're

695
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,864
Annexed

696
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,680
Goodness and the beauty

697
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
Because once they get you to be selfish wants you to feel like you're ugly

698
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Embrace your evil side

699
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,136
And as falling relation for why anyone just likes Trump and his followers

700
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,952
Because they've been globalist

701
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,744
Listen to being selfish and immature

702
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,560
Tasty honorable people

703
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,704
I do a lot of people that did not vote for Donald Trump

704
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,776
93% of them would be

705
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Be totally cool

706
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,848
With a guy who got swallowed by a whale

707
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
Still lived afterwards

708
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:07,296
I think he was pulling for names and that was an

709
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,976
I have to assume that he has like just cover

710
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,560
This is kind of like Jesus of the old test

711
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,704
David I mean there's a couple of

712
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Does people out of a desert

713
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Out of Egypt

714
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,856
We've documented a good amount of him really misunderstanding scripture over the course of this

715
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
Frequently cites

716
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,976
The Prodigal Son story

717
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,000
And get the ink

718
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
Incredibly wrong message from it

719
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,776
His version of the takeaway is that the dad really loves the older son

720
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
Who doesn't leave

721
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
Oh no you're welcome back we forgive

722
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
The basketball score

723
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,632
Close

724
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
This is where the rant wraps up

725
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
This is him

726
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
One minute to break

727
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
I realized

728
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
I got to wrap this baby up

729
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,968
So he pulls it in and he says

730
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
A couple things at the end

731
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
But I think our soup

732
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
Supremely disturbing

733
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
And then you wait

734
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,840
The globalist

735
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
Send you

736
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Desecrate you

737
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
Before you into 1,000

738
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,648
Monster truck

739
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,568
I'll tell you one thing

740
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
I like the devil

741
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
Every night when I go to sleep

742
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
Little biscuits

743
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
Devil's real he wants to kill you

744
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
We could probably do an hour on that

745
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
Yeah he comes once a year first of all

746
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,920
Really having a gen.

747
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
No favorites that has never going to push you down and meet you

748
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
It's not like the Krampus

749
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Smell

750
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
So

751
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,952
If I had to make a power ranking of the things that I find most disturbing

752
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
About the last

753
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
10 seconds of eclipse

754
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
I would say

755
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Number one

756
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Is it being like

757
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
Seen enough of the devil

758
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Bobolike

759
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
The devil what the f***

760
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,960
Does that mean number one

761
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Number two

762
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Every night

763
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
In my dreams

764
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
That's f***** up

765
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,736
I know it's probably exaggeration

766
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
What the f*** are you expressing

767
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
I think you put the patch

768
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
That could be although we has talked about his relation

769
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
Smokey smoke as a child

770
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,352
What does the younger man voice

771
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
But no longer

772
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,680
I don't think he is a tobacco

773
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
At this point butts

774
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
He might just be you know what

775
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
You say

776
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Like

777
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Tobacco Patch

778
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Super male vitality

779
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
How do you say always product

780
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
They'll probably what

781
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
Creating negative dream

782
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
He has a pill called knockout

783
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,344
That

784
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,368
That might be doing

785
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Side effects

786
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
Talking to the decal at 3

787
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Nightly thing

788
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,584
Spirit guide

789
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:39,424
Yeah I don't know I don't know enough about his

790
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
I saw that John Oliver

791
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,312
Where they bought a bunch

792
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Because product on Santa

793
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Come to a lab

794
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,664
To analyze them and they

795
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:56,064
Let me the basic conclusion they had was that they have what they say on the label in it

796
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,392
They don't have any like heavy metals or anything like that

797
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,512
So he thinks that that is like I've been cleared they tried to do a hatchet piece on me

798
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,840
But also in the in the breakdown if they have it

799
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
There's no science

800
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
The shows if it does anything

801
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
Yeah that's all just basically

802
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
Placebo

803
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Depth

804
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
So there's that

805
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Three device things have vitamin

806
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,736
Secret 12 is just vitamin B12

807
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Okay great

808
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Okay it's not a secret

809
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,344
There's

810
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,392
It's just more expensive

811
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
Did the one that you really sells meal

812
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Life-changer

813
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
Is it colloidal iodine

814
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Supplement

815
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,120
This is just normal

816
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
This is not special at all is iodine

817
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
No that's true it's true

818
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
I mean if I were to make a

819
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
T-shirt I probably mark up the price a little bit

820
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Plaistow

821
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,551
I guess why not Market

822
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,831
The price of onion

823
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:06,719
You're not going around telling people that the globalists don't want you to have shirts

824
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,839
Another trying to kill you in the shirt will save your life

825
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,007
And that is the end of the ranch

826
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
But that's the first 10-15 minutes of the show

827
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
He's on for how long is 4 hours

828
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,223
He's on four for the four years on

829
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Fourth hour today is Rodger Stone

830
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,599
Diu doesn't work

831
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,719
I heard that Paul manafort

832
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
What's that tabloid

833
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,399
Any just country

834
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,751
Yeah but all the details with us.

835
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Will Rodger Stones response

836
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,103
Do it was

837
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
Haywire they

838
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,199
I had a hole

839
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Like

840
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
Responsible

841
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
He knew that they

842
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
It came from Trump yeah super sucks out

843
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:10,463
The idea that if you like always, knowledge of the Trump plan stories in there

844
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,351
That's not good at all it's the type of thing where it's like

845
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
Give us dude that means

846
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
He's going to flip on me

847
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,471
Well there's that and they know he knows

848
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,495
Yeah

849
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
That's trouble

850
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,919
We are

851
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Some fun guests on this episode

852
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,527
That I'm going to get you ready for we got Rodger Stone

853
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,063
He's going to show up for a little bit

854
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
We have

855
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Steve pieczenik

856
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
We are going to really deal with

857
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,999
He is a former CIA psychiatrist

858
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Ghost wrote books

859
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,583
Was Tom Clancy apparently

860
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Spend

861
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,263
He'd actually the doctor

862
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,127
I don't I think he's legit I've never looked into the Tom Clancy

863
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,943
Happy stop but he is actually a psychiatrist

864
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
A psychologist

865
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
But

866
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
The other guests

867
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
There used to be most

868
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Excited for

869
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,343
Is

870
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
The podfather

871
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
Adam Curry

872
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,719
The creator of podcast

873
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,935
Why Adam Curry comes in and I got bad news you're not going to like Adam Curry when this is

874
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Iuc uses website

875
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
The message

876
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,567
Honestly I think we got to quit podcast

877
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Adam Curry

878
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Sincerely

879
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,599
Two steps away from

880
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
He'll show up soon

881
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,463
I'm going around and pit beer

882
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
O'Reilly's

883
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
That's fine

884
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
God bless

885
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
Target sell those books

886
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,679
Sure but

887
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
After that ramp

888
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,239
Going to dive into the

889
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,567
Going to go into the actual news of the day

890
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,919
Going to start by trying to really shine up that s***

891
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,223
That is the Paul manafort situation

892
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
Now before we get into it

893
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
It's important for me to point out to you

894
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Closest associate

895
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,159
On Infowars is Rodger Stone

896
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
Rodger stone is on almost every day

897
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
He hosts the fourth hour like once a week

898
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
He's apparently getting his own show

899
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
On Infowars

900
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:30,751
Tattoo of Nixon face on his bed

901
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
F*** him

902
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
But

903
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,639
The thing that the reason I needed to bring that up is because

904
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
Rodger stone is also a close associate of Paul manafort

905
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,271
Specifically

906
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
I used to own a business

907
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
These two have like a

908
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
Consulting firm

909
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
Doesn't know

910
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,607
Until the news breaks publicly

911
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,935
Means to me

912
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,983
That Rodger Stone didn't know

913
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,543
Or Rodger didn't know and didn't tell Alec

914
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,847
And either of those possibilities

915
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Is pretty f***** up

916
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
In terms of spheres of

917
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Information

918
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
To try and

919
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
Spin this in positive life

920
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,695
Do you think there's a way and I know you're building of that I apologize

921
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
The djia

922
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,559
You're you're just about to start Bohemian Rhapsody and I started talking writer

923
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,095
As Freddy's

924
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Do you think there's a chance that Jones could ever flip on

925
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
We could ever just go again

926
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
We've tried to WarGames this a couple times

927
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
I think he's in too deep now

928
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
But there's got to be a way

929
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,223
I think you could figure it out it would just require a perceived betrayal

930
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Just him awkwardly

931
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Eating crow for like 2 days ago

932
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,903
I think it would take more than two days

933
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
He's done

934
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
So much

935
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Dick-sucking

936
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:58,047
He's he's been his biggest cheerleader

937
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
For over a year-and-a-half

938
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,911
So I think if you was going to flip it would take

939
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,007
He needs to decide what it is he was going to flip about

940
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,079
Start to build it up prepare his audience for it and then

941
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
Executed over the course of like a week

942
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
Can't do it now I think

943
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
I think you

944
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
Is it in trouble

945
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
But

946
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,391
Here is a how he wants to spend

947
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
The man-of-war

948
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
FBI raid

949
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,511
Ladies and gentlemen we get to hear that Paul manafort

950
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
He got raided

951
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Ago

952
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
26

953
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
Isn't that just cute

954
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,015
FBI conducted

955
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,831
Campaign

956
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Chairman

957
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Manafort's home

958
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,815
Trump's former campaign chairman late last month

959
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,727
What's the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling

960
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,543
From what I heard

961
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Just send them all the documents

962
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,711
Russian meddling

963
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,783
Ukrainian government

964
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
Pro us capacity

965
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
So that's the first

966
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,695
Part of spin there from The New York Times

967
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:35,327
Paul manafort he was forced out as President Trump's campaign chairman last summer after 5 months

968
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
Criticism about his business dealings with

969
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
Pro-russian interest

970
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,775
Disclosed Tuesday that his consulting firm received more than 17 billion dollars over 2 years

971
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,591
From Ukrainian political party with links to the Kremlin

972
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,407
The following serves as a retroactive admission

973
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:53,247
But Mr manafort performed in the United States and Power

974
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
Ukraine's party of Reba

975
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
Without disclosing it at the time

976
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
Time as is required by law

977
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,391
The party of regions

978
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Is the political

979
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
Former president Viktor Yanukovych

980
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,559
Who fled to Russia during a popular Uprising in 2014

981
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
This is not pro us in

982
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Sure of course

983
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
This is very much

984
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Russian interests

985
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Send Ukraine

986
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,031
And the reason that he had to flee

987
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,311
Was because

988
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,639
Job Ukraine's Got really pissed off in Russian

989
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Intervention

990
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
And they're in their business

991
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
And that's why

992
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Can't go to Ukraine now

993
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
Shorty will be killed

994
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
So that's bulshit

995
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
That's a load of bull s***

996
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
Also the idea that he's like oh yeah

997
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
Turn over everything

998
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
That's why they raided him

999
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
He didn't

1000
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
You have probable cause

1001
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Like there's a whole thing

1002
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,567
What they do right but if you're in Alex Jones's head you like

1003
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:53,407
Now the globalists are just pulling strings is all for show

1004
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,943
See some people being like

1005
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Even though it's f******

1006
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Dumbest s*** like

1007
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
They're upset

1008
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Their candidate didn't win

1009
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,111
So they're coming after

1010
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,951
It's a witch and some people thinking that might be a pop

1011
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Haha

1012
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
It's the 8th

1013
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,095
Team thousand meanings addresses that they don't disclose

1014
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,911
And it's just keep happening or you like

1015
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,727
Probable cause

1016
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
You're dumb

1017
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,591
Because

1018
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Fake

1019
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,687
Stories about lies about Russia

1020
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,319
Meetings and what have you and then with your doing is they're moving the field like the field goal

1021
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,599
Removing the post

1022
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,207
Would you describe in this neck

1023
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Text clip

1024
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
It's not about it's not about Russia

1025
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
Little bit about Russia

1026
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
And now.

1027
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Just showing their cards

1028
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,143
Your check this out

1029
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
Presidential

1030
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,671
Russian now we're looking at

1031
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:14,559
We're looking at the garage

1032
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
Oh

1033
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,983
Cross board

1034
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,871
That's not that's not what I know

1035
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,919
With the idea of looking at finances

1036
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,455
Important as you can see

1037
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
Where there is foreign money coming into places

1038
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:43,743
100 different things Florida

1039
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,815
That's why you got to go and look at all this money and stuff.

1040
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,375
It's not a tax Dragnet but Alex knows his audience

1041
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,399
This is Dominic be like

1042
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,799
You know cheap moving the field goal

1043
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,871
This is about Russia even though the country

1044
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
Is Ukraine

1045
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,711
B paid 17 million dollars to Mana for it

1046
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
That's still very deeply connected to Russia

1047
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
So

1048
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
Rodger Stone comes on

1049
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,159
And

1050
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,695
Into some

1051
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Fairly paranoid

1052
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Rambling

1053
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
Which is not uncommon

1054
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
On for him

1055
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,143
Then in this next clip

1056
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
I don't know if

1057
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,983
Let me be clear

1058
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
I wrote this clip is very excited

1059
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,871
But talks about how he is in a death battle

1060
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Basically

1061
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
I don't believe him

1062
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
Google

1063
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
Publicly

1064
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,623
Augusta back often.

1065
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
We got hold on their territory

1066
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,007
Facebook

1067
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,807
Okay

1068
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,159
I don't like that he's been talking about I meant it.

1069
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Divulge

1070
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
It just developed

1071
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,071
Right I don't mind

1072
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
Site

1073
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,191
I agree with you if that were what's happening

1074
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
That's not what's happened

1075
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
He got kicked off of Google ads

1076
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Because

1077
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
He has a

1078
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Implied

1079
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
Incredibly Close

1080
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Connection with

1081
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
A president

1082
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
And my clinical figures

1083
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Google ads

1084
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,831
Okay so they refused

1085
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,855
To put him in

1086
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,391
They're advertised

1087
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
Secondarily

1088
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
He claims the Google is trying

1089
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
To delist him

1090
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,047
I make it so you can't search for Infowars length

1091
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,863
Based on something that Mike cernovich found

1092
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,167
That lately

1093
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,031
These subcontractors were hired by Google to Mark Infowars articles

1094
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
Is like

1095
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Bad

1096
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,431
Mark every Infowars thing is bad

1097
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,991
If you actually get into it it look into

1098
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
To the case what happened was

1099
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
This manual was created

1100
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
In terms of like

1101
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Yu-Gi-Oh

1102
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
It's very complicated how Google search

1103
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Work

1104
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Perform searches

1105
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Judge

1106
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
How accurate

1107
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,143
The things that come up are

1108
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,959
Quality result

1109
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,031
Thousand thousand

1110
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
The People concert

1111
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Searching for things

1112
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,199
And in their manual they use Infowars as an example of an unreliable source

1113
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,295
Oh God has consistently things that they say are proven to not be true

1114
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,319
And all that

1115
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:25,183
I'm so they used as an example of something that would be deemed a low-quality result

1116
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
Google

1117
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
It was like well

1118
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,327
General that was made by

1119
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:37,727
Company that we hired and we agree that's not incredibly fair that we use that they use that as an example

1120
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
So they corrected it

1121
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
We're not

1122
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
The d-list anybody

1123
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,615
The truth constantly proven wrong

1124
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,919
They didn't say that that's my editorializing

1125
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,199
He's not fighting for

1126
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
Free Speech if he was

1127
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,295
I would be on his side in as much as that

1128
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:55,135
If if people were like legitimately trying to crack down on him

1129
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,183
Then we can have it Ark

1130
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
Does people don't want to be involved with them

1131
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,535
And

1132
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
People are make

1133
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,655
And he keeps breaking terms of service

1134
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Anyway

1135
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
You would think that like if

1136
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
He really had an issue the first thing

1137
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,527
Like if someone really wanted to crack down and like right

1138
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,551
Stop using this music

1139
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
No

1140
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Good luck

1141
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
Just coming in every break with Ted Nugent

1142
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
Did you join this organization

1143
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,279
Access all these clips

1144
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
No God no

1145
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
I wouldn't pay for this s*** okay

1146
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
To pay for this

1147
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,799
The show is over I'm not giving him any money ever

1148
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Giving money

1149
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Come to be a bigot

1150
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
I believe him to be a very problematic racist man

1151
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
Is a roller coaster

1152
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,719
He doesn't understand all this race-baiting

1153
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,847
Most of cases trappy false flag

1154
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
Cultural Warfare

1155
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:09,279
I'll get back to this as a shot is a genital wart

1156
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,815
Shot that can be given

1157
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
AR

1158
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,447
One of the

1159
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
UVA that's one of the biggest causes a server

1160
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Purple Panther

1161
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
And if you don't

1162
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,919
If you're not able to get hbv odds are you won't get cervical cancer

1163
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Temecula

1164
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:27,967
So many women

1165
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
And Alex Jones has this belief

1166
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:33,087
That if any vaccine

1167
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
It says

1168
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
Like something is a potential side effects

1169
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,463
Then that's actually why they're giving a

1170
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
About how like autism or

1171
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
Diabetes

1172
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,399
Are like they're giving it to you in the vaccine

1173
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,727
He pulls up the inserts of the vaccine

1174
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,055
Humans biology isn't

1175
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:57,407
Incredibly complicated 2nd medication

1176
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,687
And he doesn't accept

1177
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
You think so

1178
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
Call the vaccine

1179
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
That they're giving all these

1180
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Hispanic women

1181
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
Gardasil shot

1182
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
In the third world

1183
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
In order to

1184
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Decrease their birth rate

1185
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
And what have you because it leads to

1186
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Infertility problems

1187
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Beauty like

1188
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Give him all the

1189
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:19,167
Instead of looking at it

1190
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:25,567
There are unfortunate side-effects they're going to happen to a certain amount of people but compared to the amount of death it's caused by

1191
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
People demon

1192
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Net positive

1193
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
Like

1194
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
He would talk about that more

1195
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,111
Is like the same version of Ayo I have a black friend say stackable that I said

1196
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
And also the idea that

1197
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,047
White people attack black people is false Flags

1198
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
A silly

1199
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
The idea that

1200
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
From time to time that like

1201
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
It's 15

1202
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,775
People attacking white people

1203
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,591
And what does never really unpacked especially by Alex

1204
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,895
Does the idea of the reporting of crimes

1205
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
Police believe in the crime

1206
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
People just wipe

1207
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,527
Washington's way like I'm not going to deal with it

1208
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,319
There's a systemic racism

1209
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
Inside Police Department

1210
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,415
Sharai Prime's against black people are often not report

1211
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
So

1212
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Anyway

1213
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
Like I said this is a roller

1214
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Cuban

1215
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:28,799
He's been real white identity white nationalist be up to this point this clip ends

1216
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Cuz it's

1217
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
Known to man

1218
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Fertility

1219
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Gardasil

1220
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
It doesn't mean we don't expose

1221
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,335
We need financial support

1222
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:07,967
Water filtration

1223
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,063
Why people trying to kill white people

1224
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,975
Weird racer children

1225
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:25,119
We've got toothbrushes that are impregnated with silver

1226
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,167
Werewolf

1227
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
How ridiculous

1228
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,895
The pretty like we're saying though in terms of his skills it's pretty impressive to be able to make that kind of a pivot

1229
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
Go from like

1230
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Weird race

1231
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,247
Conspiracies into

1232
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
Give us money

1233
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,807
Was that

1234
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:51,231
Dietary coverage

1235
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,839
Does manafort's stuff for now

1236
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
You know it's just a big toe

1237
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
Text Dragnet

1238
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:09,151
It's all trying to cover up for probably the crimes of Hillary Clinton

1239
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,527
He doesn't really ever cover news

1240
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Kind of

1241
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
If it was you alone

1242
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,207
And you are a bigot

1243
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
The boy

1244
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,351
Clip

1245
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,399
Finally heard

1246
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
The audio of what Trump

1247
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,471
Said to North Korea

1248
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
From his vacation

1249
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,407
I hope his quote about fire and fury

1250
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Why am I surprised

1251
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:48,319
Play like bothered by but I like why

1252
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,879
Yeah of course it's going to be the exact opposite of what

1253
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
His immediate reaction

1254
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,791
Are you bored

1255
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,607
Cuz there been a couple times

1256
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
The big ones

1257
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
These were

1258
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,447
Long ways back

1259
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:08,031
He went on a rant about how marijuana should be legalized

1260
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,567
I totally agree with that

1261
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Pump that he's on that

1262
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Okay and then also few super again

1263
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,967
Police being able to commit to the last

1264
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
The forfeiture

1265
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
So whenever you're like

1266
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
Roll around a bunch of money images

1267
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,415
That's what I think I'm super against that too

1268
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,511
Eminent domain issues like that use on the right side

1269
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
Yeah totally

1270
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
He doesn't square that up at all but I'm

1271
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
I'm not

1272
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,215
I'm not worried when we agree

1273
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Some about vaccines

1274
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,543
If there was

1275
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
Even if you're crazy there's some things you believe that aren't crazy

1276
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
Stop

1277
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Layaway

1278
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
Here is that yours Alex

1279
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,039
Doing a little bit of nice analysis of the Trump comment

1280
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
Seen before

1281
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
Nevada

1282
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,943
Fascinated by that split

1283
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,343
He looks evil the real Donald Trump

1284
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
If that's like

1285
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,439
That's your man propagandists losing

1286
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
Baptized

1287
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:42,239
So I talked a little bit more about North Korea and what's probably going to have to

1288
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
To be done

1289
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
With them and

1290
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Is off

1291
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
Knox

1292
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,687
I have four children I don't want one

1293
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,783
Butt slapping

1294
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,599
Quickly

1295
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
Get involved in this when we do this

1296
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,663
They got million plus man

1297
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,647
Rockets

1298
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,655
Not Justa control but high-powered Atomic weapon

1299
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
Hydrogen bomb

1300
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,775
Radiation weapons

1301
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
Direct energy weapons

1302
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,175
North Korea

1303
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
Butthead

1304
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,527
We are still at war with North Korea

1305
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,439
Surprised

1306
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,023
To hear that he does not go over all of it at the top of the hour do just now.

1307
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,559
That's a bummer

1308
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
That's where the clip is not great

1309
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
No

1310
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,799
But I was having a conversation

1311
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,847
About how I feel like

1312
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,919
Either someone in Japan or

1313
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
South Korea

1314
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
Going to have no idle

1315
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,087
You think it's all just a petulant child

1316
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
I hate

1317
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,671
To be a naysayer just in case

1318
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
Stopping really bad does happen

1319
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,999
But I don't call

1320
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
So I can rub in your face but all those people.

1321
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,863
I don't believe that that is in

1322
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
North Korea strategic in

1323
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
What is interest

1324
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
To have a nuclear weapon

1325
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,263
So they have like

1326
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Basically

1327
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Look at be f*****

1328
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:57,151
Using it is

1329
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
In any way helpful

1330
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,503
Like I don't think even under the sea

1331
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,039
Threat of their own destruct

1332
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Cuz I mean

1333
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
They teach the population that the United

1334
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Destroy them

1335
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
But I don't think that Kim Jeong Hoon

1336
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,255
I don't think that the higher-ups

1337
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
Actually think that

1338
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
They think that

1339
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,327
People would

1340
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,399
If they could take them out but they know that

1341
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,495
Yeah they know that the rest of the world understands that there's way too many Rams

1342
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
If they were to attack

1343
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Because

1344
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,359
Soul is such an easy target

1345
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,151
From from

1346
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,967
Beyond the DMZ North Korea could hit them

1347
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,015
So easily and that's Millions

1348
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
MZ

1349
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Play my God

1350
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:42,463
Can I get a few more workers there I like this B

1351
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,607
I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with the Chicago DMV

1352
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,143
But

1353
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Yeah

1354
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
I want

1355
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
I hope more than anything

1356
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
I don't want

1357
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
You know what a tablet

1358
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
There is one Past

1359
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
What's that

1360
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
We could have a

1361
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
The new series

1362
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
That's true

1363
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,063
Not worth it

1364
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
People do

1365
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
I would say that

1366
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,695
Short of us attacking them

1367
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
This is going to watch it

1368
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,279
But don't you look at a

1369
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,815
President who's 38

1370
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:22,143
Nothing else is going down

1371
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:26,495
Hey wait what's the way to get popular I think even he he

1372
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,775
I know that

1373
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
That's the wrong way to do that

1374
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,711
You would want to go and run out of non-nuclear countries to invade

1375
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
McCabe

1376
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Trouble

1377
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
The news

1378
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:45,951
Flexing on r-and-r not in line with the agreement

1379
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,791
He was saying already like a week ago

1380
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,607
Even if they're found to be in compliance I think they're not

1381
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,143
Which is bad fat

1382
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,727
Here's the f******

1383
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
Something about this rain

1384
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,055
If Trump

1385
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
Now invalidates the agreement

1386
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,383
Or tries to pull out

1387
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,431
The only people that really win

1388
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,247
Because they got all their money back

1389
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
And

1390
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
Positive thing for us to do

1391
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Stay in it

1392
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Yeah but a black guy

1393
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,023
Bright

1394
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,887
I always forget about that

1395
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,959
We are here what their job is it

1396
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,007
To try to get rid of everything that happened over the last

1397
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,079
Release people in Congress

1398
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Literally

1399
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:41,503
What they wanted to do today barackobama

1400
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,831
Zebra

1401
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:51,487
I called that s*** two years ago also shout out to Jeffrey Lord finally getting fired from CNN

1402
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,119
You're gone

1403
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,287
It's very difficult to keep track of all this

1404
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,823
I don't know how you do this

1405
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
Are you

1406
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,687
You brought by at like

1407
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,759
And I'm just so beat down by this

1408
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,599
Just for one day I would say that me and Jordan are both

1409
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:22,207
Crazy some sort of

1410
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:30,143
I can't explain it cuz it's not healthy but there's some sort of fun

1411
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,191
And exploring Alex's crazy

1412
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Because

1413
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:37,055
You're just jumping and you haven't listened to a lot of or old episodes

1414
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,127
But a lot of ways that

1415
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,479
He does not make anything he says okay

1416
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Get

1417
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
By my estimation

1418
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
From what I've learned over

1419
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
We're studying him

1420
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,695
Solidly for the last 8 months

1421
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Is

1422
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
That he is

1423
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
A child

1424
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
He has arrest

1425
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
The development

1426
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,351
The probably stems out of

1427
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,887
Childhood drug use

1428
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,423
Childhood brain damage

1429
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
Under parenting

1430
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,287
For some sort of abuse as a child or combination

1431
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Vera

1432
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,383
The world

1433
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
Infantile way

1434
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
That is

1435
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,991
Inform his philosophy about these globalist

1436
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:19,295
He started reading books that he couldn't

1437
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
And when he was a child

1438
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
And now

1439
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
He's gotten to a point where he's very successful

1440
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,743
Got a paranoid Army of races

1441
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
Just behind him

1442
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
And

1443
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,839
There are a lot of people like Rodger Stone

1444
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,655
Like these other gas that he has on

1445
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,679
Gorgeous using

1446
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,727
I'm just getting tricked by guess

1447
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,263
Over and over and over again

1448
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,311
It's very sad

1449
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,127
But the consequences of it are they real

1450
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
But

1451
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,687
Sent Brogan die anyway

1452
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,735
Kind of fun to laugh at the

1453
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:54,111
Stupidity

1454
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,135
Sure

1455
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,695
It's like the reality

1456
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Soaked into

1457
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,375
Some more fun stuff

1458
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,191
Rodger stone is about to appear

1459
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
He is he is not

1460
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,007
Audible

1461
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
In this clip

1462
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,359
This is Alex Jones talking to Rodger Stone

1463
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,431
This makes Scorpio predictions on death

1464
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:21,247
But he does so in a really weird way

1465
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:40,959
With with with with comedy shows

1466
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,871
He's super mad at like Colbert and John Oliver because they've done jokes about him

1467
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,967
Believe the comedy shows are part of the globalist apparatus

1468
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,575
It's a it's fun

1469
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
Yeah absolutely

1470
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,559
Cutting off our sponsors

1471
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,887
You expect

1472
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:16,543
I respect you

1473
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:20,127
I wonder why

1474
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,759
Because she was a criminal

1475
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:39,327
This is the kind of crap

1476
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,399
I'm a winner

1477
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
Move forward

1478
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:50,079
We are going to defeat these people we are the winners

1479
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:56,479
We are the free market we are the American

1480
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,039
Hello hello

1481
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,671
It's right around the corner they're going to kill me

1482
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,463
Rodger Stone

1483
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
Twice Donna death hoax

1484
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,095
Yeah like he's pretended that he got poisoned with polonium like 9 months ago

1485
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,655
Have a couple months after that he was in a

1486
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
Bizarre

1487
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,495
Witness list car

1488
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,567
T-boned by a guy who's trying to kill him

1489
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,199
Present the idea he had the flu

1490
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,735
He said he got polonium

1491
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:35,135
His doctors told him not to tell anybody I said don't talk about it

1492
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,951
Polonium poison

1493
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,631
No you said all that crazy

1494
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
Zip.

1495
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:56,639
Shabadaba

1496
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,455
Could just do the s*** out of

1497
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:03,551
They came to the came to an agreement because he apologized

1498
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
Then retracted

1499
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,599
The story that he did

1500
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,903
But ever since then he's played it like

1501
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,255
They couldn't wait to get out of that lawsuit they're lucky they got out without paying me

1502
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,303
Do you reported lies

1503
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,095
Besto Trump

1504
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,167
Entire episode about the Chobani situation

1505
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:24,543
That's really interesting episode

1506
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
That really highlights

1507
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,127
How f*****-up Alex's

1508
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:33,759
Ciabatta bread it's really good I love it

1509
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,551
Sure know a lot of that

1510
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Oh my God

1511
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Shirt

1512
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
So Rodger stone is on

1513
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
And his next clip

1514
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
He reveals that he's part of a secret

1515
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,511
Society

1516
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:49,119
But talks about what they do

1517
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,447
Which makes it no longer really a secret society

1518
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,567
I heard something about him being a swinger I think you might be but you know I don't like to get into people's personal lives

1519
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
I don't know if that was what I was

1520
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,871
No this is

1521
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,895
Very Trump debate

1522
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,183
We have pledged

1523
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,983
For a government raid for harassment

1524
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:35,199
So you're in good company

1525
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:44,671
Because you're the tip of the spear because you are

1526
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
So

1527
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
You see there the it ends with some nice

1528
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
You're the best

1529
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:53,375
That's a Hallmark of Alex guest sort of manipulating him

1530
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,191
You're so important you're the you're the greatest

1531
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
Rodger Stone got this group of three hangs out with

1532
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:04,127
What are you do you just sit around with like brandy

1533
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:08,479
Sit around and talk about this is going to be targeted

1534
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,527
Jared Kushner

1535
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:14,879
Clearly doesn't indicate that he had any foreknowledge of

1536
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,695
Manafort's raid before the news broke

1537
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,231
Zion Wednesday

1538
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,767
What is he now

1539
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,815
What kind of inside information does he have

1540
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,143
It's just him and his a****** friend sitting around and commiserating

1541
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
That's

1542
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:33,311
Crazy also if you're really a secret organization don't f****** bring that up on the Alex Jones Show no

1543
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,615
That makes me think that you just

1544
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
Maybe it isn't

1545
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Girls Club

1546
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,455
So weird

1547
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,807
He doesn't have a lot to say it's mostly just up

1548
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
Yeah that's it

1549
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,879
But now we got to get to Adam

1550
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Got it to the podfather

1551
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Oh my gosh

1552
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,023
Should I throw to a video

1553
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
He doesn't

1554
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
No but he

1555
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,911
He does have a podcast apparently called the No Agenda show

1556
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Which

1557
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,471
He

1558
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
Every podcast

1559
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:06,591
I got an agenda do you have one I feel like you're one of like 6 people to have a

1560
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:09,151
Agenda

1561
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,735
Some agenda

1562
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:17,855
Everything's like the no Spin Zone is like the worst name show ever

1563
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:23,743
Like what you mentioned he is a former MTV VJ

1564
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:29,375
Basically I don't know exactly she invented podcasting but everyone being like

1565
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
The first

1566
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,679
Yeah to do podcast

1567
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,727
But also what you don't know

1568
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,775
Is that his uncle was a

1569
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
CIA

1570
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,639
Dawn

1571
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,943
Don Greg

1572
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
This is named parallel

1573
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,575
And so he has a lot of information about North Korea that you don't have

1574
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,671
Because

1575
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,487
He wants to give you a little bit of analysis

1576
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
About the North Korea situation

1577
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,095
And I actually do agree with a tiny bit of

1578
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,119
In terms of

1579
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,679
Did this is probably not going

1580
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Flare up

1581
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
But his take on

1582
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Is very interested

1583
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
The people are still in

1584
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
Once you see them leave

1585
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,943
That's probably that's probably

1586
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:21,855
Industrial complex

1587
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
What region

1588
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:35,167
That we've been trying to sell the

1589
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,239
We of course want missile-defense there to keep our eye on China

1590
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,799
North Korea is not suicidal

1591
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:47,199
I also don't think the president's words meant nuclear war

1592
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,991
Fury and Fire

1593
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:55,391
And really hot

1594
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:02,047
In another remove in his negotiations

1595
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,607
Kim Jeong Hoon

1596
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:11,007
One way or the other

1597
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
What's trying to sell them at what time

1598
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,504
Well

1599
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,040
I don't I don't think that's what

1600
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,320
Primarily motivated

1601
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,160
But then beyond that with the end

1602
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,440
You got to give

1603
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
Kim Jeong Hoon

1604
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,512
The chance to save face

1605
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:36,352
What they're getting at what they get into is the idea that Trump will be like

1606
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
All right look

1607
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,680
You get rid of your nuke

1608
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,776
And then 50 years down the line will reunify Korea

1609
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,312
And it'll be you who did it

1610
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,128
Be the one responsible for reunifying

1611
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
North and South Korea

1612
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
Like what that's what

1613
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
That's what's going on

1614
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,040
You think that's what's going on

1615
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
That's not what's going on

1616
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
No

1617
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
But that's what they think of

1618
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
Because

1619
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:06,304
That's what North Korea would want but if it

1620
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
If they're in charge

1621
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,096
Right

1622
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,656
That's a big problem with this

1623
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,192
Because neither side would copper

1624
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,496
Yeah and that's why they

1625
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
Our two countries

1626
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,616
Michelle Renee

1627
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Okay

1628
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
I will do that

1629
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,016
Adam Curry is

1630
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
A bit of a ray

1631
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,880
Realize

1632
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
The guy who brought us podcasting

1633
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,488
Is a difficult big

1634
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,816
But let's listen to this next clip

1635
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
Explains that desert

1636
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,424
Cultures are not compatible

1637
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,800
Well obviously there are problems and to my original premise

1638
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:55,200
The problem is we want to have stuff in that area to keep on Shining

1639
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Interested

1640
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,552
There's stuff going on that we really don't understand don't know much about

1641
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
And man do we have

1642
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,624
Cultural differences

1643
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,184
Incredible cultural differences with the Chinese

1644
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,512
Chinese tourist I was in in Florence

1645
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:21,056
We are very incompatible from everything that I've seen and I'm just talking about the people that come to

1646
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,872
Sisters

1647
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,712
But she's completely

1648
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:32,832
WhatsApp

1649
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,080
Push you out of the way

1650
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,408
So this is one of the big

1651
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,712
Nationalist narrative

1652
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
Is that other cultures are not compatible with ours

1653
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,832
Yeah because of I don't know

1654
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,392
Intrinsic problems that they have

1655
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,096
Put on the street for people homeless

1656
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,632
Sure in every culture

1657
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,424
Chicago

1658
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,728
It happens in every city

1659
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,008
With homeless

1660
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,568
So it's f*** off with the

1661
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
Trying to paint Chinese

1662
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,896
Evil Street shitters

1663
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,664
Yeah

1664
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,944
But

1665
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
I work in tourism

1666
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Where

1667
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,392
You know you get sort of stereotypical Lake

1668
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,952
Well you know what I don't normally get tips from

1669
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
People from this cut like that often

1670
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,560
European

1671
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,328
Who don't give a

1672
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:56,544
Go to parts of Europe tipping is rude

1673
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
So like you giving a tip

1674
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Is

1675
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:02,944
Out of line so what we think is generous is actually not appropriate

1676
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,736
So they're not being rude

1677
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Feels bad cuz he want their money

1678
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:14,464
People love me so much I only made $4 I'm not sure if I like you so much but it would be rude of them to give you

1679
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232
Money because

1680
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,768
Oh poor person here too

1681
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,584
That's the motivation behind

1682
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,352
Anyway

1683
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,400
I drove last night for the

1684
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,960
Cheap trick for sale yeah

1685
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,752
I made $285 in

1686
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Everyone's on Polk

1687
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,872
Is great earth coked-out going to be Cheap Trick

1688
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,152
Brother man somebody

1689
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,992
Very strongly

1690
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,040
Dislike The Narrative of

1691
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
Incompatibility

1692
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,904
Proven

1693
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,952
By people

1694
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
Being unwilling

1695
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
To be compatible with

1696
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,536
People who come in

1697
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,864
That's how the evidence is incompatible

1698
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
Because we bully people

1699
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,960
I&i Uno other them

1700
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:00,288
Until they insulate completely into their own

1701
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
Cloisters

1702
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,640
And then one crazy person of that group attack

1703
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,432
Awesome then we see it is

1704
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,504
Compatible

1705
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,784
What sister

1706
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,832
Look at the whole Rihanna. Whatever

1707
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904
She's not that way cuz you Rose

1708
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,000
Eraser the United States you raised her culturally different yeah that's how

1709
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,840
Confused on point though

1710
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
No because

1711
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,984
Those cultures are bad

1712
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
And we don't want

1713
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,080
People from those cultures coming into our culture

1714
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,384
But I just don't understand

1715
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
The end

1716
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,456
Serta result of that mentality

1717
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Because

1718
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,272
At a certain point

1719
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,600
It has to be eradication of those bad cultures

1720
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:52,000
It's all gravy baby

1721
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,560
I think he's dumb and

1722
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,656
I really really really really really get worried when people start

1723
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Disgust

1724
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,728
The possibility of

1725
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
Integrate

1726
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,312
And stuff like that because it really smacked

1727
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
Of

1728
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:12,224
It's not cultural if that's not what it's about

1729
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,040
People who are different

1730
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,064
Course

1731
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,160
One more quick left before we before we end this adventure

1732
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,232
Well you know

1733
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
You know there's only so much

1734
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,304
To discuss

1735
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
He only yells about North Korea couple times

1736
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,680
Paul manafort narrative is stupid

1737
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
It is

1738
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,032
I expected honestly that's a rant you did it

1739
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
Beginnings take us much longer to get through

1740
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Yeah

1741
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:42,176
You wanted me to not talk as much

1742
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,712
Cuz you're allowed to get there

1743
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
Size for a pulled back

1744
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:47,296
Apologizing

1745
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Spiritually we have a lot to

1746
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,928
Lot of lot of bulshit

1747
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,696
Yeah

1748
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Describe his balls

1749
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,560
Alright this is Adam Curry

1750
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Saying

1751
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:00,864
Some stuff

1752
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
That

1753
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
I don't know how to put two

1754
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,728
Too fine a point on this

1755
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,520
She might

1756
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,312
Be a literal name

1757
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:16,736
I don't know and I'll explain my case after the create

1758
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,832
Okay so what if he had a podcast early that's

1759
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:26,976
We can still keep podcast

1760
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,816
Next week Leo Laporte thought I was Chuck

1761
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,608
So here is a

1762
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:37,216
And then what's the cultural deal with

1763
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:48,480
Running around like pirate ships

1764
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:01,280
Further in the European Union are recently

1765
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:05,632
The idea is to create a uniform

1766
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:11,776
People who look like in Amsterdam

1767
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,568
And I saw the transition

1768
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,384
First it was a Turkish Inn in Moroccan

1769
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
Second third generation

1770
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,624
The culture kind of float

1771
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,672
Is to have a big massive people

1772
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:31,488
Bringing people who can do the work that the

1773
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:36,864
The old people the whitest people

1774
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:43,264
And slowly create a big

1775
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:56,832
Beautiful buildings injuries

1776
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
Yes

1777
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,952
S***

1778
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
Yeah

1779
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
So

1780
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,560
Do you want to learn a little bit about what he just said there

1781
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,352
So he's talking about white

1782
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
People race mixing

1783
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,704
And stuff like that and how that's really negative

1784
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,520
Yeah he brings up the color

1785
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:21,664
You not making it up it's not a conspiracy theory

1786
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,688
Now

1787
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
If you're out there listening

1788
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,760
Please feel free to do

1789
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,064
Google the kalergi plan

1790
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,624
It's kalergi

1791
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,464
You can go as far as you want down the Google results

1792
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,024
Almost every single website

1793
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
You will find

1794
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,328
Is white

1795
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
Supremacist

1796
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,376
Neo-Nazi

1797
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
F******

1798
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,728
Crazy anti-semitic New World Order

1799
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,032
Yeah hundred percent

1800
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,848
There is no such thing called the kalergi plan

1801
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
It is something that is

1802
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Meetup

1803
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,920
Buy these

1804
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:56,224
Dudes who think that whiteness

1805
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
Is somehow being under attack

1806
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,064
It's a white genocide narrative

1807
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,600
And here's how it began

1808
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,904
There's a guy named Richard Vaughn

1809
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,184
Cove color

1810
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
You're the gentleman back in the 20s

1811
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
He came to prominence

1812
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,888
He was the son of an Austrian and a Japanese wife

1813
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,728
Multicultural in his in his life

1814
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,776
And he understood that

1815
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,848
Another bad thing to have different cultures

1816
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,128
I in your family

1817
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,200
Who is Big Life

1818
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:29,504
Create something called Deep and European Union

1819
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,296
Back in the in the

1820
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
Twenties

1821
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,880
His philosophy he believed that

1822
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,928
Race would eventually disappear

1823
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,464
Hey societies evolved

1824
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,256
And

1825
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:43,840
That all these white nationalist white supremacist sites take out of context

1826
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,120
Is this quote

1827
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,192
The man of the future will be of mixed race

1828
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,752
Today's races and classes will gradually

1829
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
Appear

1830
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,568
To the vanishing of space-time and

1831
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:58,176
The Eurasian negroid race of the future appearances

1832
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Egyptian

1833
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,528
Will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individual

1834
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:06,368
I find nothing scary about that

1835
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,208
Everyone all these f****** people are

1836
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,488
Scared about their whiteness

1837
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
That they're like

1838
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:16,864
Did the plant that's what they want that they're going to make that happen

1839
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,656
All he's saying is

1840
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:25,312
That's probably what's going to happen as people get rid of their hatred overtime and become more acquainted

1841
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:29,664
Did with other cultures Bowl outcome of of people

1842
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,712
Not being assholes

1843
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
We have planes

1844
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,552
We have ways to be around the people of different things.

1845
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,832
So it's going to happen

1846
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,624
People got to be falling in love or f******

1847
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,184
And that's probably a radical

1848
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,792
In the twenties of this is probably what's going to happen in the future

1849
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
Not at all

1850
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,096
A crazy idea

1851
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,680
That is there were to be some sort of thing where he actually said

1852
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
I'm going to

1853
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
To make different races

1854
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Is Buck

1855
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,544
I'm going to make him interbreed

1856
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,336
In order to create these

1857
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,384
People who look like ancient Egyptians

1858
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
Then

1859
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,736
It's f***** up

1860
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,808
Cuz I don't think you can do that

1861
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,136
The problem store

1862
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,928
It's forced

1863
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
Crossbow

1864
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,792
Problem problem

1865
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:19,584
Secret of a bigger problem implementing

1866
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,608
That plants

1867
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,400
They believe that like

1868
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,984
These these migrated melted

1869
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,288
Do that

1870
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,872
These migrants that are coming into they believe that it is like

1871
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
A force

1872
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,200
Wave minorities,

1873
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,736
2D white place

1874
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,552
Bucked up

1875
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,624
That is straight-up white supremacist

1876
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Thinking whites

1877
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Supremacist

1878
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
Good plan

1879
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,816
I took it was like they're bringing these people in

1880
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:53,120
To do jobs that old white people don't want

1881
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
What to do anymore

1882
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Which

1883
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Still happen

1884
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,056
We can kind of agree is

1885
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
Disparity

1886
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,104
There is like

1887
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,176
Immigrant labor issues but that's not what the color

1888
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Really fun

1889
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
2

1890
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,856
Compare to Alex Jones

1891
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:18,208
And Adam Curry talking about the kalergi plan it being globalist

1892
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,768
Wanting to d-white society by bringing in

1893
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Brown and black people

1894
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
In order to breed with them

1895
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,632
Hitler opposed

1896
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:31,008
The clergy

1897
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:35,360
Because he felt that this pan-european Union idea would be a pacifist country

1898
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,384
They wouldn't be able to

1899
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,432
Defend itself against the inevitable

1900
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,968
Attack from the United States

1901
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,016
Okay so that's one problem

1902
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:46,624
He also believed that the the planning for the pan-european Union

1903
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
Was full of Mason

1904
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,232
Which if you want to translate to Alex Jones vernacular

1905
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,768
Global

1906
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
Don't forget it

1907
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,328
There's a problem

1908
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:58,400
Because Richard Vaughn I could have colored

1909
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:01,216
Was roundly post anti-Semitism in defend

1910
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
And the Jews

1911
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:02,752
Vociferous

1912
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,568
So Hitler hated this guy

1913
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,920
And thought that his organization was full of globalist

1914
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,456
Yeah basically

1915
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
There's an analog here

1916
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,016
Alex Jones

1917
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:17,088
Kind of undecided.

1918
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
That's where I'd like to leave things

1919
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,184
Terms of italic

1920
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:23,232
There is no kalergi plan

1921
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,512
Adam Curry

1922
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:29,632
It's f****** straight-up spouting Neo-Nazi white supremacist bulshit on Alex's show

1923
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,680
I don't give a s***

1924
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,984
Grew up on MTV

1925
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,264
He did

1926
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
Wake me up

1927
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:39,104
Alex Jones one of his biggest problems he doesn't f******

1928
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,408
Have anywhere to save the world release

1929
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,432
So you just allows people

1930
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,968
Ideas like this

1931
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,064
I'm going to guess that he doesn't know all that much about this kalergi

1932
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
Plan idea

1933
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,880
For that the only place

1934
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Are f****** hate

1935
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,536
Stairs

1936
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,072
Scares me the idea of him f***

1937
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,376
Screaming at me about demons

1938
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Gunship

1939
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:08,800
An hour behind

1940
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:15,200
What do you think that would sear Xperience of your first Adventure into Alex Jones lamb

1941
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,552
It is not Paul's as I would have guessed

1942
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,160
Once I put in the

1943
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:26,464
The practice of people actually watching it for real

1944
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,536
Once you start to think about that it becomes less funny

1945
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,328
And also

1946
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,888
I appreciate that you take the time to do all this

1947
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,704
Can watch the video of him also doing that

1948
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,264
Like some of those

1949
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
Like

1950
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:44,128
It's not bad but I would have like to seen what he was doing

1951
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:48,480
It's not as visually appealing as you might think.

1952
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,320
Screaming once you seen it all the time

1953
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,880
This is very rarely

1954
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,184
Aesthetically pleasing

1955
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,768
Ready to do that but never will

1956
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,376
But you have to listen to the whole show

1957
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:11,776
Do I ever

1958
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,800
Yeah

1959
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,872
And they're still after 8 months

1960
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,408
There's not a point where you're kind of like

1961
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Parkside

1962
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
No

1963
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,880
Because I know enough about him know that I'm not going to be led down to The Darkside by a f****** idiot

1964
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,672
There are moments

1965
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
When

1966
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
Maybe I

1967
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,768
A couple times I've gotten high in the last

1968
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Few months

1969
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,584
Those are the times that I'm like

1970
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,144
I can't handle this

1971
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,448
Because I Am Naturally skeptical of rich

1972
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
I don't think

1973
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,520
Vetta corporate interest

1974
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,568
Are really they don't want to

1975
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,640
I do have a distrust

1976
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
Of

1977
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,200
5 super powerful

1978
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,016
Really confident and on a rant

1979
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
And I'm a little high

1980
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:58,624
I can't defend myself severely I'm like

1981
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,952
You're really confident about your ideas you must be right

1982
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
But that passes

1983
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:06,048
I realize oh no no no no no

1984
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,096
This is a monster is dude

1985
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
Angel Robles.

1986
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,680
I don't understand

1987
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:16,032
And maybe it's cuz they're older they're getting older they're scared what might happen

1988
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,592
The world after they're no longer around

1989
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,640
You mean Alex

1990
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,664
Korean

1991
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
Does Clipson

1992
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,224
Play they want to keep the white race

1993
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:26,272
Like I said it's mostly with

1994
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,136
The last moments at my heart

1995
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
It's tops

1996
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,208
And that it's all done

1997
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,584
Right

1998
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
You know heaven

1999
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
But

2000
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:44,704
I don't know

2001
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Maybe it's cuz I don't care

2002
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,360
I don't know I just don't care I think I think one of the pieces of it is that for you and I

2003
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:54,944
The fact that were white doesn't matter that much to us

2004
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,784
Yeah a lot of people who it is a very important piece

2005
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
To them

2006
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:03,904
And then I also almost a little not a flip of that but in the same vein

2007
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,440
Is that we are white

2008
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,720
And we are

2009
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
So we have to

2010
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
To be conscious of notches

2011
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
Taking that for

2012
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,400
Cuz I think we do is easy

2013
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:19,520
These that you take for granted that's just your life that's the life that you've always known

2014
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
No matter what

2015
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
You are or whatever

2016
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,384
So but I get reminded by like my fiance when she's like

2017
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,920
Yeah I had to I ran into

2018
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,968
Do the courtyard and like make sure the door was locked

2019
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,992
Because I was afraid of some

2020
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,016
Get me

2021
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
That makes no sense

2022
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,856
Because I'm 6 ft 2 in gigantic

2023
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
Is never a fear of

2024
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:43,328
Sure you know black people dealing with

2025
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,424
So it's

2026
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:51,776
Wright's I'm trying a new Baseline for a lot of other people's existence

2027
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Yeah

2028
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,592
And I'm trying to be more aware of

2029
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,272
Okay I want to erase pen
