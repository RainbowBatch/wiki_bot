1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

2
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Monica

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Everybody

6
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
At the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
Fashion for Yahoo

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
This might come off Patty and maybe insulting

11
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Sing to you

12
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
But it is a bright spot

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,968
You can take that or you can take a bright spot that doesn't sound like a bright spot

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
I could get us to a brighter place you like

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,000
Bright spot like a workplace evaluation dismissed this system that is not good not good

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,632
Onodi the petty and possibly a wanted I've been doing all these but

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
I am sending buttons at people and

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
The emails

19
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
Taking people's addresses

20
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Insolvent

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,456
I'm not going to say exactly how many I've gone through but I will say it's in the low four digits

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
I got I forgot one the other day haha

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
That was addressed to you

24
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
Literally all the other puppies

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,168
Almost all of them are like damn I know you're the one

26
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
There was one only one out of all of them that was addressed to Jordan and then said something

27
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Like say hi to dance

28
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Whatever that is

29
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Gets

30
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
I don't know I'm going to send you something

31
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,600
Special that's what's going to happen I thought that was really amazing

32
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
It's very funny

33
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
I mean it's it's something to start from every Journey Of A Thousand Miles begins with one

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
Email

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
The other the other maybe not a bright spot a better place

36
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
Is

37
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
I have a message

38
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
To KitKat

39
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
Shut it down

40
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,344
Original.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
Regular ones fine with these flavors

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
The fruity cereal one

43
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,560
Key lime pie

44
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Shut it down

45
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
It is it is funny how it seems like what happened with most of these candy companies are like McDonald's or something you've

46
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,152
See what they do in Japan or something here like

47
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,784
The race ball flavored Kit Kat what are you talking about that was 10 years ago or like

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
We should try all these flavors and now they're here and we're like stop it

49
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,976
Shut it down maybe there is a way to do a while I may be in Japan

50
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
It's being jonuel

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
And maybe that is the case

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
It's not being done well here

53
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Will be in a better place

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
If you just stop it stop it stop it calling you out who loves novels and things

55
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Stop

56
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,224
How about you with your breakfast is the challenge has returned

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
MTV Challenge by one reality TV show that I have somebody who's spent

58
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Hours watching Survivor

59
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,000
Season upon season I must shake my head at you

60
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,119
I don't know why those stupid idiots I just I just love him so much

61
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,471
The only problem this year is for the past few years

62
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
I've been tracking

63
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
My new favorite character I've let you know remember young CT

64
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Of course just crazy that guy absolutely eyes bloodshot always ready

65
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
New Years for a few years

66
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
He's been fat CT it's been fantastic

67
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,695
Apparently something happened my partner insist that he just got divorced but

68
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Because he is back to being

69
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Right here if the guy also back to being of violently abusive

70
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
No no

71
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,799
Completely different like he's a weird dad

72
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
The younger people are having trouble they always show up next to him and he's like

73
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Like I ain't know what you got

74
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
You got to see what happen

75
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
You know like he's just

76
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
He's just this weird Buddha

77
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
Is a drunken rage if he was really big

78
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
And now he's gotten

79
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
Back I bet he's off his meds if he's definitely more likely to drink

80
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,103
Thought about you to be having these

81
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
Experience and excitement that I had when I was

82
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
20

83
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,063
22 watching CT

84
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
The little Unbecoming for a thirty-year-old but whatever

85
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,511
How do you say again maybe somebody was watching

86
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
In the past 3 weeks

87
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
Still watching it until I actively don't enjoy it

88
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
That might be a theme in my life

89
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Alex Jones

90
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
I don't like it and I

91
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
Alright therapies on Wednesdays

92
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,479
Really weird so Jordan today we have a episode where dipping back

93
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247

94
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
India at the end of last week where we did is we put out

95
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
Reposted episode of bathtubs

96
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Just came out the

97
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,255
He was sort of behind some of this information

98
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
The Mike Lindell was going over a person poziom right

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
And I kind of realized we need to do now

100
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Disable Symposium is over

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
Is it we need to go back and look at this as a snapshot

102
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,639
We need now we have closure I never got ahold we'd know for sure

103
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
They Trump did not

104
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Cymbalta

105
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,879
He was an open question at the end of last week

106
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
There were some people who really did think

107
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,535
Who really do you record on Thursday so we didn't know what was going to happen on Friday the 13

108
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Is very important in numerology

109
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Bickley to the global

110
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
The occultist

111
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,031
No I would finally believe in all superstitions regarding Friday the 13th if suddenly Trump was

112
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Reinstated as president I would be like

113
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
I guess they're all true

114
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
I guess there we

115
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
If we

116
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
Had a 13th floor in a hotel after Trump got reinstated

117
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,391
If I were Trump and I got reinstated on Friday the 13th as president

118
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Take to the podium

119
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
At my first words would be

120
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
Bwahahaha

121
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
Straight up dr. Wily call it a comeback or something like I do something funny

122
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Oh man

123
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:46,175
I don't know if you get cleft would say that if you get elected on Friday you will owe me

124
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
Almost certainly be assassinated on Saturday

125
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Let her be gone till November

126
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,463
Go go that don't make him a Halo no

127
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
Do we do a show

128
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Are We Done Yet

129
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,495

Love it because there's that there's a good amount

00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Through

134
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Really

00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Really delightfully

136
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,159

00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
Maybe the David

185
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,935
This is the day that Alex has built up as the David

186
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
Biden is going to announce martial law

187
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Right now maybe it'll happen

188
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
But maybe it won't and if it doesn't happen it's because he's scared the globalist

189
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
Until you try to walk that line here on the 11th

190
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
I want to play the puppet in Chief

191
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
Nationwide

192
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Band-Aids for masks

193
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,167
Non-essential businesses

194
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
They were talking about

195
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Day

196
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,319
But I stand by my sources and Jack stomach sources they were looking at

197
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
As the day to announce new Nationwide man

198
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Last night

199
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
Biden said he's looking at the wall

200
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Violates the law

201
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
So maybe it's going to happen

202
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Start today

203
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,567
Alex also has to know that the emergency alert test

204
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Going to happen while he's on there

205
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
Yeah so

206
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
This is a weird

207
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
He's putting himself

208
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
In a barrel

209
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
You shouldn't do this

210
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
List yourself you know that eventually

211
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
You're going

212
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
To be on air when the thing doesn't happen

213
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
That you said maybe

214
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,327
Sure but have you considered doing a little bit of soft shoe and saying X

215
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Stage left

216
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Maybe

217
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Well we will see what happens okay

218
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,983
But before that that deadline hits

219
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
I don't have some time to fill and so he does it by

220
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
Complaining about math

221
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Stop versus another particula

222
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
McAlister's on the back

223
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
This product is

224
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,559
Product is not a respirator and will not provide

225
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Any

226
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Protection against covid-19 Coronavirus

227
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Coronavirus

228
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Want to read that again

229
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,639
Not

230
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Not a respirator

231
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
And will not

232
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
Provide any protection against covid-19

233
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
Coronavirus coronavirus Azure contaminants

234
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,743
Let's just read it one more time

235
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
Not

236
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Not a respirator

237
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
And will not

238
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,935
Not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not

239
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:06,335
Any any any any covid-19 covid-19

240
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
Coronavirus vs. other viruses viruses or other

241
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Contaminants

242
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
I'm not trying to get nauseous here

243
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
I need him to read it again

244
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
I didn't get that

245
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
And you know he read it so many times it's like when you say a word too many times and it loses all meeting shovel

246
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Shovel

247
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Any shovel

248
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,215
You kept saying I started thinking about belly buttons like you don't need to eat or not doing this well

249
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Yai

250
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
I think that was

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Poor attempt to not be obnoxious

252
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
If that's truly is invention

253
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Sat

254
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
That is to doing his show what

255
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Increasing your font to

256
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
20 is to writing a paper

257
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Do you know what I mean like

258
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,487
I'm going to waste as much time as I can sing as little as I

259
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Yeah that's also like

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
The equivalent of

261
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
Putting something in all caps and thinking you're strengthening arrabbiata

262
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,031
Just from a meme that went around last year early in the antimatter

263
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Ask days

264
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
It's my feeling that the messaging on mask

265
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,919
Has been pretty clear if you're actually paying attention

266
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
And not a knee-jerk reaction Dairy a******

267
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,343
Masks are an important part of the pandemic response but doctors and health experts I've seen

268
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
I've been pretty consistent

269
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,231
Getting across at the way that they help is not by making the wearers

270
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Super safe from things getting

271
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
They helped by limiting the amount of droplets

272
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
That escape

273
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
From the wear themselves

274
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
By limiting the amount of possible virus you could be

275
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Spreading you in effect

276
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Protect everyone around you by reducing the odds of them

277
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Coming in contact with the virus themselves

278
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,943
How to pierce to be arguing against a straw man here namely that the reason to wear masks

279
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Check yourself

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
You can repeat that warning labels

281
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
From a boxer

282
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,855
So masks 100 times if he wants it just doesn't mean anything

283
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
He's arguing against the wrong

284
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Yeah it's

285
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,255
It does seem like there has been a lot of resources spent trying to

286
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
Confuse people as to what the

287
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
The point is you know like

288
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
If you would

289
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,191
Explain to somebody if rationally without

290
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
The influence of everything that

291
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
It's about protecting others

292
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
I think it will not be hard to convince

293
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
The problem is that trillions of dollars

294
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,247
Accusing people into being that's about a combined effort that has a

295
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
The cumulative effect absolutely

296
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
So the text that I was reading is just from this meme

297
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
It's not the packaging of an n95 mask

298
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
It's just a box of

299
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Standard cloth masks

300
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Who's Isabella's in all this s***

301
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
And repeating it over and over again

302
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Because then

303
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
He's hoping it will Drive-In

304
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
To the mines

305
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Of his listeners

306
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Zambia compelling

307
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
All caps

308
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:46,591
Yeah you might as well be like this is not scuba gear you cannot breathe underwater with this

309
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
Breathing underwater

310
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
That's some bad advice

311
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
At least

312
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Say about advice

313
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
You got to smoke in the water

314
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
You better have goggles on

315
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
I don't try it at home

316
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:18,079
Very long this is useful

317
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Useful conversation

318
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
Just giving you a pointless piece of information

319
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,807
And said that it's super effective but it also kill you

320
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Hey this

321
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
Just so you know this is how you make this

322
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Function right

323
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
You will die

324
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Go to it and this is route

325
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,655
It'll work for a little while but also you'll probably kill yourself

326
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
Hey don't go back into a burning building

327
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Wow now hiring

328
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,639
So Alex talk some more about this this warning label that's on the back of these Mass

329
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
About belly button

330
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Censored

331
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
Wait the warning label is warning label is that

332
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Any media that wants to cover it

333
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
It's answered

334
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Except for the media that Alec

335
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
What is sighting in Taka

336
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Think about how

337
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
That's trouble

338
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
Look at all these articles

339
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,071
Wul article

340
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,727
Verified fact check why the face Matchbox says it provides no protection to the where

341
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,079
You try to put this out on Twitter Facebook YouTube Google any of them

342
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,175
Apple let you put these articles out local news national news

343
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Happy that's not

344
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
True

345
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
This article itself you can post

346
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Anywhere

347
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
Explain to me how there can be all these articles

348
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,791
Which are assumably posted by and hosted by these Outlet

349
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
And yet also

350
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
All these artists

351
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,263
I'll be suggesting that there are a large number of

352
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Octopi

353
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Social media

354
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,199
I don't think that maybe some of the articles that are on like really dicey blogs

355
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,295
Maybe end up with her like hey this is improve warning

356
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,903
Right maybe that is something that happens if you try to post them on social media

357
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
Maybe

358
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
But this article that Alex is talking about the what is it the the USA 9 the wusa9 local

359
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
News article that you can post whatever you want it part of the reason is because

360
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
It is

361
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Where Alex is seeing this meme

362
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
Image of it but it describes

363
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,711
And explains why this meme is sending inaccurate information

364
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Context it's writer Asian

365
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
And I don't know I don't know what I don't have

366
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
But

367
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Compelling

368
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
Feeling about this being a sensitive

369
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,535
Yeah I'm going to go with no this is not censorship

370
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
There are all these articles

371
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,655
So now also be surgeon-general like

372
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,495
A year ago said Don't wear mask that cuz man

373
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,871
Surgeon General

374
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Which was true

375
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
February

376
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
See how that works oh

377
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
See how that works

378
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
That's a headline that I was reading

379
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,767
From February of last year when the Surgeon General dr. Jerome Adams came out and asked the public to stop buying all

380
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,143
All the matter wasn't it because people were hoarding a s*** ton of masks barbecue couple issues

381
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,983
One of these uses that there is a fear that the public could make a run

382
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Nan masks

383
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
It was possible then they

384
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
Medical professionals will be unable to get

385
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Protective gear they needed

386
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Do their job

387
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Another factor it's super important

388
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
To consider that at this point in February twenty

389
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
T20 we didn't know what we know now

390
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,391
This is prior to the understanding of the novel coronavirus could be

391
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Be transmitted by people prior to them developing

392
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Symptoms

393
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,119
If you're operating under the assumption that only symptomatic people are contagious then widespread masking isn't really all that important

394
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,007
People have symptoms should stay home or where I'm asking that's largely cut down on a lot of the transmission

395
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,895
However it pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus or able to cause new infections

396
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
Leave a completely different scenario on your hands

397
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Now if you

398
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
You don't have symptoms

399
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
You may not be sick

400
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,440
But you might be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic so even if you feel completely normal there's a chance that you could begin

401
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
If you're going out in public

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Without a mask

403
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
This Dynamic is what change the government official guide

404
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Amazon widespread mask

405
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Understand

406
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,984
MedExpress was possible there really wasn't that much of a reason for people

407
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Both wear masks unless they were sick

408
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,360
After that aspect of the virus is better understood game critical for people

409
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Wear mask

410
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
Not to protect themselves but

411
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
To drastically reduce transmission to other

412
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,344
Alex even knows all this in his willingly misleading his audience about very important public health issues

413
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Or he's really unable to

414
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Breast basic

415
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
Concepts and probably shouldn't be trusted

416
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Interpret information

417
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Yeah

418
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,144
Yeah it's kind of interesting that far right propaganda usually boils down to

419
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Future could be anything

420
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
Past can be seen 2020

421
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Yeah

422
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,104
Yeah really f****** nailed it and so much of this

423
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
If you

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
You get down to the actual details and

425
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
The fact of the Imp

426
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Information that there

427
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Disseminating

428
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
It really does break down into two possible paths

429
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,904
You're too dumb to understand what you're talking about

430
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,952
Or you're willfully misrepresenting this

431
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
And putting people

432
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Greater risk

433
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
I don't know

434
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Neither is acceptable

435
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,168
Yeah I mean you know you can be both too dumb to understand.

436
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,240
The greater context but understand just enough

437
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
To distort it

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
In order to make money

439
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,848
I think I just explained America

440
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
So you up buddy

441
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
His name is Randy

442
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
If my best friend

443
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,856
Concerns that Rand Paul has been censored

444
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,624
Bye

445
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
All sorts of media

446
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
YouTube

447
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,584
He wasn't concerned about Rand Paul's wife using information in a little bit

448
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,192
But yeah Rand Paul Valley was giving a little bit of a

449
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
About how

450
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
This this meme

451
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,592
About masks not helping people

452
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
Look at me

453
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,760
Look at that mean there's nothing to look at over here

454
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Intuit

455
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Complaining about it

456
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Here's his response video Indian also taken down

457
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,488
Recently I shared a video on my YouTube page

458
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
It was an interview between myself and a journalist

459
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
We discussed a variety of topics including

460
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,168
The science behind wearing masks

461
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
Apparently would you care to contradict dr. fauci in the government

462
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
YouTube has removed my video

463
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
If you want to see the video it's up on rumble.com does not censor the news

464
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
What's unpack here

465
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,368
First it recently came out like you mentioned that Rand Paul's wife box talking

466
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
Gilead Pharmaceuticals in February twenty

467
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
20 which is only disclose the

468
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,536
This past week well past the 45-day deadline

469
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Supposed to report this

470
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
He's kind of purchases at

471
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
I would assume that she just bought stocking Rumble

472
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Was well huh

473
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
He personally 45 days after his wife stock purchase happen

474
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,616
To be right in that sweet spot last March when Kelly loffler and David Perdue

475
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
We're getting very serious criticism

476
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
From the Press about how they may have used Insider information

477
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
Gained and briefings to make stock market

478
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
At least they didn't face any consequences

479
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Is 4in but it also sounds like

480
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,488
Exactly the sort of time that a man with Integrity like Rand Paul

481
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,328
Yeah I wouldn't want to step up and create any kind of appearances that he was doing similar ship

482
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
I bet he doesn't want to debate

483
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
Whether or not people in power

484
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
I should be able to buy stocks or not

485
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Probably not

486
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,800
This revelation of Paul's wife stock purchase and it

487
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,104
It's very delayed disclosure amount

488
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:47,872
The problem

489
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,688
The first is that there is the appearance of insider trading

490
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,504
There may be no insider-trading going on and it's

491
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Plausible that Miss Paul Bop

492
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Let's talk without any information

493
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
France

494
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
Okay so it looks really bad

495
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,512
The second problem is that this means that Rand Paul had an undisclosed financial interest

496
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
Austin government policy as it relates to covid response

497
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
Weather naughty Act

498
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
Did the further those interests

499
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
He stood to gain

500
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Four more people getting sick

501
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
And from there not being a vaccine

502
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
That is widely available

503
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
Because they pop Gilead

504
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
Produces rendezevere

505
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:25,248
There may be no malfeasance here but there's a giant cloud of Suspicion and I would like Grandpa to debate you on that's okay

506
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
I would too

507
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,344
Also it seems like Rand Paul might be promoting Rumble

508
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
That was a little bit

509
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Declaring rumble.com

510
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,024
They don't censor your information

511
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,424
Mbele

512
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,960
Raise an eyebrow except

513
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,776
Week it was reported that Rumble was signing up people they deemed

514
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
Quote thought leaders to promote their platform as an alternative to you today that's good stuff the big names

515
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
Glenn Greenwald in Tulsa

516
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
What's wrong with those

517
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,416
It's enough to make you wonder if grandpa is another quote-unquote thought leader

518
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,720
You certainly seem to have a difficult time making

519
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
Timely disclosures of

520
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:12,608
Conflicting interests I guess maybe we'll know in 16 months whether or not that was paid

521
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,752
Spawn confer Rumble if you got into government to do anything other than grift and make

522
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
Money I don't understand what you're doing and

523
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
What else is it for Dan

524
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
So Alex had an intention

525
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
On the show today

526
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Remember that song by Afroman

527
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
I was going to pay you my room but then I got high

528
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,000
The only song I remember

529
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
I was about to go live today

530
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:49,728
Articles

531
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Where you at

532
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,848
Last night and this morning

533
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Doing research

534
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
This morning

535
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Man versus

536
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Self

537
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,928
I intended to come in today and write a headline about major victory in the club elixir in trouble and

538
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
Came out and came up

539
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,400
Forgot about that

540
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
More coming as we speak

541
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
But martial arts

542
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
Reminded me

543
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,736
The martial arts

544
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:38,368
I was going to do a show about Victory but then I got scared

545
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,648
I

546
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
Remember

547
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
Today is the day that martial law is supposed to be announced at all we've got is a day about victory

548
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,864
Okay

549
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,264
Big victories of the martial law happen

550
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
The only one that matters

551
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,592
Yeah I think they're one of the

552
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,408
Primary things that he considers the victory

553
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,224
In terms of things he's going over is that

554
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
Number places like the military have

555
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
Confirmed that there are religious exemption

556
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Right

557
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,696
It's like that's not even something

558
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
It wasn't

559
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
The case a week

560
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,536
To go

561
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
We knew that Vic

562
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Grateful victory

563
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Thank God for

564
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
For small America

565
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
Any discussion of forgetting about having

566
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
To do a show by victory

567
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,872
He's talked a little bit about

568
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Women

569
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,736
Are going to poison people or something this is strange

570
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
The women just start poisoning everybody

571
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
Could I have a

572
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Reference

573
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
Domestic help in East Los Angeles

574
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
Take really good care of him in

575
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Real tide at night

576
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,360
It really sounds like he's telling people to kill

577
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Made

578
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Killing

579
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,248
Alex is very clearly saying poison

580
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Poison Poison

581
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
If you have access to them

582
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,488
I mean like a lot of billionaires are getting divorces these days because most of them were friends with Jeff.

583
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Epstein

584
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,632
I mean who's better poisoning the next why it's always the spouse Dan

585
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,264
I don't know what side of the law this is on but it doesn't feel this imaginary poisoning

586
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,824
I don't I don't think this feels yet

587
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,456
He's he's saying that you know like the women are going to come in and poison people because that's the stage rack

588
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
Cuz man who

589
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,368
Not done the job or whatever fall of Rome or it was

590
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
How to play every single culture throughout all of history this is what happened right after the play

591
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Pyramid or whatever

592
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
The Zhou dynasty that fell due to all the women poisoning all the Gemini remember that's with humans

593
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,776
Sacrifice

594
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,360
And the meat Supply

595
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:12,992
80% human meat

596
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Black Pyramid

597
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
And then women poison folks

598
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
I don't know

599
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Call Montana

600
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
When you're not going to boys

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
Anyway

602
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,232
The killing is going to

603
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
And Alex

604
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,560
A little bit of a ramble here about how he's

605
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Pretty good at

606
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
That stuff

607
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
Revolution

608
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
But not the one of the comics

609
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
Convert everything

610
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
We've all got red blood

611
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
The blood of Christ

612
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,568
Freezer meals

613
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,896
Call

614
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Call

615
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
The Red Terror

616
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
With the red blood

617
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Assange

618
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:55,488
You sent you scare us with your red star going to spill our blood

619
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
We're more than happy when the rubber meets the road

620
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Killing machine organize Focus reading

621
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,176
Don't want to kill ourselves or to steal something or feel like we're men

622
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
Only kill to protect

623
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
When the killing starts

624
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,856
Killings going to go for a long time

625
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,000
He's having a bad day and then blank

626
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,608
Those are the reasons that they want to kill and then he's like to protect innocence in your light come on

627
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
You know that's not your guitars there's nobody we didn't tell you what reasons we thought you wanted to kill you

628
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
You were telling us

629
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
So one of the reasons

630
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,712
The kill is because he believes that covid vaccines

631
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,016
Are killing off everybody and it's part of this

632
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
Globalist

633
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
We're all dead

634
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
Anti-conservative is he has to lie

635
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
A lot

636
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
There were the same number to Destin illnesses last year as the year before

637
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
This year

638
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
Dudley I got the forces

639
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Various horrible covid

640
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
The world right now

641
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
And it's not the covid-19

642
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,312
That was the exaggerated virus

643
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
High protein

644
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,128
Swapping off and shedding

645
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
And spreading

646
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,992
But the majority

647
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
The shot

648
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Alex does just have things anecdotally

649
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
By the way

650
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
But even he knows that that's like anything's I got to pretend I have

651
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,584
Stats

652
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
But I couldn't possibly have

653
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Also says there's the same amount of illness and death last year as every other year the year before it and that's it

654
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Completely

655
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,944
Journal of the American Medical Association put out a paper in April that looked at excess deaths from March

656
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
2020 to January 2021

657
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Impound 520 2300

658
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
68 excess deaths

659
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Took place during the

660
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Yeah.

661
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,304
According to the CDC 2854522 resident deaths were reported in the United

662
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
In 2019

663
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,888
It takes a while for concrete numbers

664
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,704
Come out to that report wasn't formally released until December

665
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,776
2020 and as such we don't have a formalized number two

666
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Recite right now

667
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,360
But the CDC has released a provisional count

668
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
For 2020

669
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,968
The provisional number of deaths in the US that year 2020

670
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
3358800

671
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:27,808
14

672
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
The stuff hour to talk about it

673
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Bulshit

674
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Like there's nothing

675
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Thing to back up what he

676
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
You saying cheese areas

677
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
A lot more.

678
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
That took place last

679
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
Yeah

680
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
2 + 4 I mean

681
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
It's good to have the numbers but we all knew that

682
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Anecdotally

683
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Alex

684
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
Anecdotal

685
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,800
No no

686
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,824
Yeah it's ghoulish

687
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
Like this this kind of denial over

688
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Hub.

689
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Now that's massively

690
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,552
So nothing is f***** up is that Alex didn't go to his new bosses symposium

691
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,624
He didn't go well wowowowo

692
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:07,488
They're not he's not paid by Mike Lindell okay let's

693
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,304
Let's get that right out in front of the gate

694
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,376
He doesn't take money from Mike Lindell unless

695
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
People click on the link

696
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,496
He will put on his website in order to get a referral fee

697
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,640
In terms of the people that Alex's latched onto who are money

698
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Folk

699
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
This is probably the most

700
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
She's like Tyler Anderson created

701
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Career Center

702
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
With his gold sale

703
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Money

704
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,184
I meant doctor group took things to a whole new level with the supplement

705
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Right and what have you this is

706
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Who this is

707
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
I don't think this is going to last

708
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
Now his involvement with Mike Lindell I don't think it's okay

709
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
Going to go on Long

710
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
Just

711
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Transform products

712
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
Leica if you've fallen from gold

713
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Fake pills

714
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Down to just

715
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Best pillows

716
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
There's almost a narrative tolls go and get the excited there's a gold rush

717
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,880
You go out and you try and do try and make your money in the mines

718
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,256
And then you know you need those pills to stay up and chip away at the the or

719
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
And then I take a pillow

720
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:19,680
And it's exactly like splitting his career to bed

721
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
Gold rocketed up to the top

722
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,800
Too many trucks

723
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
How is this

724
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Yep

725
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,224
So he didn't go to the symposium

726
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Symposium

727
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:53,984
I want to go it's so jam-packed it's a lot of great information

728
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Cam

729
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
So I just decided to stay here

730
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
With my family

731
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
It was an omen

732
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:08,064
Plane broke down when broke down

733
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
What you going to do

734
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,928
I mean I don't know when the last time I heard of

735
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:15,488
The plane completely breaking down and get another flight

736
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,072
And you couldn't get another flight within another couple hours I a man

737
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Gaslight

738
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
It's from Austin to Sioux Falls

739
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
Real small airplane

740
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,520
Real book okay okay

741
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:33,920
I don't believe that Alex doesn't have the kind of money that you can Charter a plane or something

742
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
He took a

743
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,528
Helicopter to go hang out with Steven Crowder

744
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,552
To be a

745
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Tank plane

746
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
It would have to be a plane that has full armor plating all over it it's got to be it's got to be in style

747
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,816
Michael and Al promised me a jetpack it didn't come through

748
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
Butterbur Glendale promise

749
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
To be honest

750
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:00,544
Alex talks about how you know there's a lot of good news

751
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
That's true

752
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
It is true

753
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,664
But there's a reason

754
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
And then Alex start

755
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Spiraling off

756
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Send to

757
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Nonsense

758
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:15,648
I see so much positive news everyday but I tend to only give you the bad news

759
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
One thing I won't put up with my crew

760
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,096
But I want no bad news yesterday

761
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
I don't want to know it later

762
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
I want to see it

763
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
I remember

764
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
15 years ago

765
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
Off record

766
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
Obelisk

767
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,552
A well-known age Lebanon

768
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Okay

769
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
Alright Alex always the same speech

770
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,000
Don't you want to be a star and cinnamon Crusade you're going to fail the bubble

771
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
You'll never be able to save them

772
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,704
Don't you get what you put in all this bad news you just Karen demoralizing

773
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
You will

774
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
You are kind of people

775
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Really cuz you don't feel like mine

776
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,528
Feeling

777
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,232
Here's my theory talk to me exactly how I talk to myself in the mirror

778
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Furthermore even

779
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
The devil respect me

780
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
If there are

781
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
So many f****** globalist

782
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
All the time

783
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
You're my people

784
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
Maybe he is

785
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
Maybe he is

786
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:46,272
Baby what they're saying to him is that you're never going

787
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,856
To be what it is you think you are you're exactly like I

788
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:56,000
BRB the ship

789
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
He admires

790
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,840
Secondary theory none of this

791
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
That's a good thing

792
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:07,008
The reason I believe that is Alex gets into how he's had eight meetings with the globalists

793
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Over the years

794
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,616
Number and one of them

795
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,664
Gives us some details on

796
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
It doesn't

797
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,552
Sounds so much like a meeting with the globalist haha as it does like maybe he was getting interviewed

798
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
By somebody sounds right and

799
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
Abu

800
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
57

801
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,120
Calendar phone

802
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Monthly editor coming down here

803
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
I don't California

804
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
That was terrible

805
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
The reason this is important

806
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
Alex you're just scaring them

807
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,952
You think you're in powering them to fight

808
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Back

809
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
You're actually scaring them

810
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,328
Not going to fight now

811
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Ali saying

812
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
Humanity

813
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
Horrible this is

814
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,592
They're going to wake up and decide to fight you instead of being slave

815
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:21,760
Pretty telling that Alex thinks that being interviewed by someone at the Atlanta counting is it some kind of meeting with the globe lights

816
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:26,368
Scary if you count meeting with a guy from Atlantic Monthly

817
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,488
I'm guessing one of the other meetings that he's referring to is like that time use on Piers Morgan show

818
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
9 include

819
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,864
It must yeah and Hot Springs

820
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,264
Kamillion meetings with global Civic out every time he's run into somebody on the hike

821
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
Bike Trailhead that's a fourth tier Global he doesn't get those I'm guessing the people who have interviewed Alex in the past

822
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
Blasted why you spend so much

823
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Of his time scaring his list

824
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,784
That seems like a really obvious question

825
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
Asking if I were a journalist that might be a good place to

826
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Start

827
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
Alex experiences this as

828
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
The globalist telling him that he's scaring the audience

829
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
Send that to submit to there

830
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Allstate

831
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
Believe

832
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,888
30 bring them bad news in order to wake them up to reality and spur them to action

833
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
Really cute thing for him to believe

834
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,008
But it's all based on nothing and it's b*******

835
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
How to make the audience scared in a very specific way

836
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,432
Away where there's no productive outlet for your fear other than things that Prophet Alex

837
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
Personally

838
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
There's no real action items at the audience

839
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,832
Check off a list pass promoting Alex's media Outlet

840
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
And buying products

841
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,648
To make sure that Alex's media out looking

842
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
Continues to exist and if you are a Service employee

843
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Poison people

844
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Call fees are other

845
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
Beyond that there's literally nothing you can do that's going to make it

846
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:51,360
Take for example Alex's insistence that operation lockstep is a Rockefeller battle plan that was written a decade ago and is now

847
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Being put into action

848
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
Which is what the whole covid

849
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,175
Pandemic

850
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Been about

851
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
If you're in Alex's audience

852
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
What can you do with this information

853
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,111
Obviously you can give Alex money to keep talkin about it

854
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,719
Or you could spread links around to your friend so they see Alex's videos talking about it but

855
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Ultimately what

856
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,279
What can you do that's productive

857
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:14,655
Even Bill Cooper was like let's buy Turner Broadcasting

858
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,191
You can't do anything

859
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Because this isn't real

860
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,591
Do you try to band your neighbors together to have an anti operation lockstep protest

861
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,687
Do you write your elected officials and demand they put a stop to operation lockstep

862
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,247
Do call the news on demand that they look into the evil

863
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
Operation lockstep

864
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,319
You can't do any of that s***

865
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
And have it mean anything

866
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,671
Because the thing that I was just making you afraid of it isn't real

867
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
Putting together protest is a waste of your energy

868
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,631
Can any elected official or media entity worth their salt is going to look into your claims and immediately realize that there's no story there

869
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,703
The underlying documents misrepresented in weaponized

870
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Be something it's not

871
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Anyone

872
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
Who's not also

873
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Just trying to get in on the grift

874
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
Isn't going to give this the time of day

875
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
Alex build his audience with empathy

876
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
We are an outrage

877
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
There's nothing they can do to proactively work

878
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,551
To resolve the unsettled feelings that is Goosebumps

879
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
What coverage of headlines creates

880
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
This is the business model

881
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,207
Because Alex knows that as long as he pretends to be the tip of the spear

882
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,023
The audience knows that their primary job is just

883
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Keep him in this Bay

884
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Big fight

885
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
Where this gets dicey is what you kind of brought up

886
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,215
And that a very small percentage of the audience was a very different reaction

887
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
Ultimately realize there's no productive outlet for their anger in

888
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
And Alex also caters to that

889
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
You know he fans those flames

890
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
Politically right

891
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,391
Plausibly deniable way or whatever I was speaking metaphorically

892
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
But there is a small percentage

893
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
That end up

894
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
Succumbing to a nihilist

895
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
Nothing is ever going to work

896
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,143
And part of the reason that nothing is ever going to work is

897
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Because you're fighting

898
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
Well I mean and not

899
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
Just that but it also creates a feedback loop

900
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,335
For you where you believe that you will never be

901
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
We listen to

902
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,711
Imagine if you do send I'm going to send a letter to my elected official

903
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
Which is what I'm supposed

904
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,319
What to do in that letter is about all this b******* I'm continuing wall

905
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,207
And then they don't respond to me so clearly there's no reason to go through that the other thing that he's recommended his violin

906
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
You know like you can't

907
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:22,399
You can take send a letter to your state senator that's like we demand an end to the Griffin screeching into

908
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,935
Good morning and then like I don't

909
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:29,055
What are you f****** talking about people don't have time to patiently explained to you

910
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
Why is the thing you're angry about isn't real

911
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,711
Fiercer gryphons are mythological

912
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
They're not to be right

913
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,599
I know it's a hippogriffs on the map

914
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
Excuse me

915
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,303
Even though you sour shouted Wingardium Leviosa things are not going to float around you I'm sorry indeed

916
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
They are not

917
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,423
It's time for Alex's still record

918
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,055
The new segment on a show where Alex tells a long-winded story if it's

919
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
In this

920
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,151
Addition of Alex's story Coronado

921
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,687
He gives a woman up the Heimlich

922
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Somebody else did it

923
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Madeline

924
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
French restaurant

925
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
Not a fancy French restaurant just like this

926
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Chain restaurants

927
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Almost fast food

928
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
Wife

929
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
A year-and-a-half-old

930
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Rex

931
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,199
Woman

932
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Batwoman

933
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
White sandals

934
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
No one's helping her

935
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
She's turning blue

936
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,703
When I go to the Heimlich maneuver

937
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
Don't look at me like I'm a space alien

938
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,615
Back then I was in really good shape

939
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
What are you doing

940
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,631
Huge piece of bread comes out of their mouth

941
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
Huge glob she was turned out she was down syndrome

942
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
What's up

943
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:41,151
Just happened here

944
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
What is happening

945
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
And

946
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,655
Thank you you're a hero

947
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
Let's get out of here

948
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,895
That's the spirit of the left

949
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
This is weird

950
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
That story is weird

951
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,319
That is a weird so I can identify at least three or four different points where I think like

952
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,927
The story did not go with the way Alex is presenting it

953
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,743
I mean this is the type of story where it's like

954
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
Somebody else did they send you just

955
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,863
Have remembered it in your brain to where you're the hero

956
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,447
That's what's happened really possible or like people

957
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
Might be alarmed by the way Alex

958
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
Interact with people

959
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,615
And not want him charging

960
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Now their loved one who might be choking

961
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,063
Person with Down Syndrome

962
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,183
I don't know why you said any of those word leave it leave us alone

963
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,487
Please stop hitting your child

964
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:06,143
Yeah maybe she wasn't choking maybe she was maybe this did happen maybe it didn't

965
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
But I don't know what any of it means

966
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:13,567
I guess that Alex has decided that they were going to sue him if you didn't leave

967
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,615
Which is based on nothing cuz

968
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,943
I know that they said you were here oh thank you so much

969
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,759
So he had to bail

970
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,575
Cuz they're going to sue him for saving her life

971
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:31,231
We got to get out of here that those people call me a hero that be there about 2 that's the spirit of Alaska

972
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,351
Rambling ass stories

973
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
Nothing

974
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:41,727
The entire restaurant gave us a standing ovation you know they're about to kill us

975
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
No one likes me

976
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,127
Valex gets to a conference mother headlines

977
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
And here's that you the first

978
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,039
You and the globalist arriving in UK for climate Summit

979
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,623
Moltres covid restrictions imposed on British citizens

980
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
But not

981
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,095
Private corporate leaders and government leaders coming to set up the world.

982
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,423
Isn't that just special

983
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,775
Sounds kind of fudging some details about this upcoming climate Summit taking place

984
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,543
Glasgow

985
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Call the COPD

986
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
E26

987
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,479
Precautions and rules

988
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
A little bit

989
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
The people coming in for the

990
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
But that doesn't mean they're just

991
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,391
Ignoring safety measures all together the way Alex make

992
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,159
Cloud

993
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
For one thing delegates coming in from countries that are on the Red List will still have to isolate and quarantine Hotel

994
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,887
410 days upon arrival if they've not been vaccinated

995
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,191
In 5 days if they are fully packed

996
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,495
According to the BBC quote

997
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:52,639
They're also requirements to self-isolate for 10 days for those coming from a countries who are not fully vaccinated

998
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:55,711
The approved programs in the UK us or Europe

999
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
You went beyond that the summit says quote

1000
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
They will have strict

1001
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Covid testing protocols

1002
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:04,415
Open place including regular testing to ensure the health and well-being of all

1003
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Allstaff attendees

1004
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
And the public

1005
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
And

1006
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
Quote there will be further Public Health measures in place at the

1007
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,839
Cop26

1008
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Including cell

1009
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,935
Something face coverings when delegates are not seated

1010
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
And a comprehensive

1011
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,519
Set of hygiene and ventilation measure

1012
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823
Yes I mean there's still tons of

1013
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Precaution being

1014
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
Into account

1015
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
It's just

1016
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,783
How are you going to strike a balance between these very necessary climate Summit

1017
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
I bet that you know

1018
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
Clearly

1019
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
Important oyi

1020
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,439
Two reasons

1021
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,999
And also take into consideration

1022
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Covid

1023
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Concerns you can't just

1024
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,631
You don't want to say okay nobody can do

1025
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
This at all

1026
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,239
They already postponed to Summit from last year

1027
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:55,871
Yeah if you want to stretch and say that it's unfair you've got a point but

1028
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
If you're mad about it there's so much

1029
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
Childish it to go I'd like what

1030
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:06,623
It does seem to be from like everything I can tell they are going out of their way to still be as cautious as possible

1031
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
Yeah yeah there's yeah

1032
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
So Alex is another headline

1033
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
Yeah this one's a little bit

1034
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
Other folks are fighting bad parents are filing complaint against Atlanta Elementary School for segregating students

1035
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
Classroom

1036
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,823
Black classroom blacks their communist

1037
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,407
Recently Kila Posey mother of a black

1038
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,991
Accident at Mary Lin elementary school in Atlanta filed a complaint

1039
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,807
Alleging civil rights violations on behalf of her daughter

1040
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,671
According to the telling of the story she was discussing which second grade teacher will be the best

1041
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
For her daughter with the school

1042
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Principal

1043
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:47,839
Hey what you brought up one teacher that seems like a good fit the principal told her quote that's not a black

1044
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
A class

1045
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Celebs that

1046
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Of the six second grade teachers of the

1047
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
The school only two more options for black

1048
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
At this point I can

1049
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,943
Can find these allegations and I can also find some indications that other parents of students

1050
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,735
The school feel like these allegations are under

1051
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Found it

1052
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,903
Multiple of them to school yearbooks as evidence that there are not black or white classes at the school but I haven't

1053
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,231
Seen the pictures of these yearbook sure I don't know exactly

1054
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,047
I feel like this is a bit of a difficult situation

1055
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,095
Since I don't know all the details in it

1056
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
It's really hard to figure out what's actually going on

1057
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,191
It only makes matters more

1058
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,775
Confusing that the Atlanta Public School System released a statement that said quote

1059
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
APS does not condone assigning students

1060
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
The classrooms based solely on race

1061
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,015
When we learned of allegations of this content occurring during virtual instruction at Mary Lin Elementary School in

1062
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
August 2020

1063
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:42,367
The district conducted a review and took immediate and appropriate action

1064
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
At that time to resolve the issue

1065
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:49,023
That kind of reads as if there was legitimate segregation going on but

1066
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
It's also not specific enough to be able to determine what the

1067
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
Exact situation

1068
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Right

1069
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
I feel like as this civil rights

1070
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,519
Complaint progresses we will probably learn a bit more but as of right now

1071
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
I feel like this is

1072
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,103
As much as I'm comfortable with conclude

1073
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:07,455
But I can tell you that no matter what the reality of the story ends up being a

1074
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,735
It's definitely not with Alex's

1075
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
Reporting

1076
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
He's playing with his classroom segregation was being done to teach white kids that they're inherently evil into packets to be communist that would be

1077
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
Be very weird thing to do

1078
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,095
Ultimately his version of the story has the focus being with the white students are the ones being was victimized by this

1079
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
When it reality if he allegation

1080
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:30,495
Are accurate this is a case where educational opportunities are being withheld from Blackstone

1081
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:37,407
Solely based on their race seem like historically at least segregation has not been about

1082
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
Spy disadvantaging white p

1083
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
People in any way

1084
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,831
It doesn't seem like that story is an indication as any indications of that either

1085
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:48,415
This guy is kind of an essential piece of Alex Jones's races

1086
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
Gasoline station will desire

1087
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,607
The Coop the oppression that other groups experience and secretly being about oppression against white people

1088
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
It's honestly really sick

1089
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
Yeah well I mean

1090
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
What you were doing

1091
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:07,871
Is taking the thing that you've done to other people based solely upon race

1092
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Claiming that they're doing it to you

1093
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,735
In order to justify

1094
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,039
Continuing to oppress those people

1095
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
Not just sick

1096
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:21,951
It's f****** insane that's more or less than the game plan

1097
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
If you were to be a coach

1098
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:31,679
These headlines in any of these stories any realizes like

1099
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,983
Man it was really fun talking about how I

1100
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
Had meetings with

1101
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,847
I should talk more about that

1102
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
So

1103
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,919
I was thinking about something

1104
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
But I can't

1105
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Because

1106
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,623
Non-disclosure

1107
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
When

1108
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
Show it to me

1109
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
Fruition

1110
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Closure

1111
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
What are you f****** talking

1112
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
Let me just tell you this way

1113
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,871
I recently met with representatives of the cobbler

1114
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,967
And I told me

1115
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
As if I didn't know that

1116
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
We are criminals

1117
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
You know you seen the Godfather movie

1118
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,487
We control things

1119
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,279
And our job is to destroy you

1120
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
Do you know

1121
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,703
Just so you know I need you to know this

1122
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,799
We are criminals

1123
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,223
We're on everything

1124
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,015
Used

1125
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,807
Rod

1126
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
These people like I look like you just

1127
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,719
The NBA's are like magic or something

1128
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,279
Disclosure agreement cannot involve

1129
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:05,119
Being on disclosure of criminal activity

1130
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
To keep

1131
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Criminal actions are

1132
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Confessions

1133
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
Secret

1134
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:14,335
Because of an NBA youngboy Al Capone

1135
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
Sullivan's Witnesses

1136
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,015
So there's nothing we can do I got to say is NBA is Ironclad

1137
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,831
Families of the mafia

1138
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,903
Always sign and do you know how easy it would be to have a

1139
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,463
Conspiracy a criminal conspiracy

1140
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:41,215
It's so childish it's so stupid I don't know I would I would guess that maybe

1141
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
Alex is talking about a deposition

1142
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,823
I don't know

1143
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:53,759
One thinks it's really fun is like event starts struggling to try and understand why these globalist

1144
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,319
What do the thing that they're not doing like

1145
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,087
Why

1146
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,367
Why would they

1147
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
Why would they do this why would they have a meeting just to tell me they're evil possible to understand the behaviors of

1148
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,559
The creepy monsters in my head

1149
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
Like we're criminals we're going to destroy you

1150
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,447
YouTube

1151
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,335
You mean to tell me your bell we didn't think you knew that

1152
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,919
Smiley face

1153
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
At the end there I was at

1154
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
Jobe

1155
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
From Arrested Development

1156
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,879
Yeah I mean

1157
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
Oh yeah

1158
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,463
30000

1159
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047
If the other

1160
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Yep that's bad

1161
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Lattice

1162
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,655
Underground

1163
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
Exactly what's going on here

1164
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,055
The globalist wouldn't have a meeting with you just to say that they're evil

1165
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,335
Because you made that up

1166
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Pretty simple

1167
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Wow shampoo

1168
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,343
So he's killing a lot of time seem like his front is gone all the way up to size 45

1169
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,415
Wasting so much time it could be using to talk about victories

1170
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,463
Thredup forgot the

1171
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
That's what we are. But unfortunately I think one of the problems is that

1172
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,815
His staff is interrupt

1173
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
And pretty regularly

1174
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,655
They want it they need to tell him about like

1175
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
Breaking news

1176
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
Of course

1177
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,287
Every 5 minutes they come in and give me a new article

1178
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,687
Another hotel another wedding venue

1179
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:32,063
Where you can't go if you're not injected with a poison akkala vaccine

1180
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,695
Even though

1181
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
When you take the shot

1182
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,863
Makes you shed your admittedly

1183
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
What's the business owners

1184
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
I love women

1185
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,079
What is there a good start

1186
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,151
Sunday teenage movie

1187
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,687
Women

1188
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
Sounds like you're about to tell us otherwise you know who every person in Austin is shut their business, take a shot

1189
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,767
Who want to be impregnated psychically by Bill Gates

1190
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,839
Jeffrey Epstein

1191
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Okay

1192
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
Alright

1193
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Alright

1194
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
Hey listen

1195
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,391
State came for the vaccine

1196
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,975
For the wedding venues that I said nothing

1197
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,255
Because I wasn't getting married

1198
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,679
Hey man I've done some research into all of these businesses that

1199
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:56,031
Are coming into me every five minutes from my staff which seems like

1200
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,847
Waste of their time necessary updates

1201
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
And all of these businesses are run by women

1202
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,247
Because they want to get psychically impregnated by fauci and Bill Gates

1203
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Right

1204
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
Has he ever noticed

1205
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
That many of his gripes about women

1206
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
Center on the idea of

1207
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,767
If Mannitol allow them to get out of pocket

1208
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:21,375
They will poison everybody and run the world like with vaccine mandates

1209
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
And try and f*** Bill Gates all the time

1210
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
He's a mess

1211
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,519
So it did

1212
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,335
We're getting to the point in the show where the emergency alert

1213
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
Is scheduled to happen

1214
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,663
We've all been very

1215
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:40,063
There's a pre-announced time it's going to happen

1216
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
Trying to play a game

1217
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
Well it's about 7 most telephones and cable TV radio system

1218
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:54,655
FEMA and President Joe Biden

1219
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,703
Roll20

1220
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
She unfolded

1221
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,927
Politicians are 20-30 minutes late

1222
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,999
As it all unfolds

1223
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,559
So there's going to be this emergency alert test

1224
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:27,935
Nmn buy milk I'm out 20 minutes later or something and

Martial law

1227
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Okay

1228
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
Okay alright

1229
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Do you know

1230
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,895
You know how when you plan the

1231
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
Concealer

1232
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:43,551
Downy really scary

1233
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:47,647
Could you know exactly when it's going to begin countdown clock and everything

1234
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,927
You known about it for months

1235
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
You know it's no big deal

1236
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:54,303
And yet still you're telling me that on the day you're going to announce

1237
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Martial law after this

1238
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,911
Months-long planning

1239
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:03,263
You still going to be like 20 or 30 minutes late like what's going to what's going to hang you up from

1240
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
Firing marks

1241
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,639
Biden weird guy was late

1242
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,271
Got to go to blaze up before he goes out there and declare martial law

1243
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,831
Are you ever declared martial law on Wii

1244
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:21,695
If it was set to happen at 4:20

1245
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,023
I would I would be like okay that's a fun martial law

1246
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
Martial law

1247
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
So Alex

1248
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,143
I think that he

1249
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,031
A little disappointed cuz the alert happens and it's not really anything

1250
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,823
But he's got to sort of like

1251
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
Okay we're in that space where it

1252
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
It's happening

1253
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,431
Around the country

1254
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
I'm going to just vamp

1255
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
A little bit

1256
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
The Pentagon

1257
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,391
All these evil guys

1258
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,439
25 years ago

1259
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
Mike down for this

1260
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,351
This is phenomenal this is just outrageous

1261
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,191
Again in Mainline Pentagon documents 25 years ago about

1262
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,311
We've been passed by DARPA and the Rockefeller Foundation is the Carnegie Foundation to end War

1263
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,711
Have a plan to put humans in tanks

1264
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,295
Computer systems

1265
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:23,135
People will live in peace and we'll be able to have a Mainframe computer

1266
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
And the power of their own heat

1267
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,999
Computers

1268
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:31,583
That was a theoretical.

1269
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
Made the movie The Matrix

1270
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
Is right now

1271
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,639
Emergency alert system

1272
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
Telling us

1273
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,087
Atone

1274
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,439
We are the tones I can take over the Scramblers

1275
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
That's not the town

1276
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
The old system

1277
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,095
That would launch tones

1278
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,655
To check out with the radio or TV station

1279
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
I want to fight

1280
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,919
You can show the image of it

1281
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,415
We can't even show you the emergency alert

1282
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
Twilight Zone

1283
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
It's like a year-and-a-half ago during lockdown

1284
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,191
I told you it's all Bs word essential company

1285
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,751
We can stay open

1286
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Batman

1287
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
When we got here

1288
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,711
Am I allowed to show a video of this sub

1289
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:12,191
Attempts to divert wild king Obama attempts to divert

1290
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
That's not good

1291
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:19,871
That spiral into a whiny tantrum I don't know

1292
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,407
Can't play the Biebs

1293
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,455
Because of course

1294
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:30,111
Cuz the engineer or whoever's the producer is concerned that playing those beeps over the radio stations would over

1295
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
Verizon signal or something

1296
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,695
Sure that is the technology that

1297
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
It's still used but I don't know what

1298
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:42,143
Size radio stations Alex is on around the country

1299
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,239
Antiquated Radio Systems

1300
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
Seems like a legitimate concern if you're a producer to have

1301
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Better safe

1302
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Ansari

1303
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,895
Alcoholics

1304
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Freaks out

1305
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,199
I love that they're like

1306
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,247
Play whatever you were

1307
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,319
I am a man babe

1308
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
What I listen to something like that

1309
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,671
The first thing that comes to mind is

1310
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,439
Professional

1311
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Sure

1312
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
And if I were the globalists

1313
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,839
I would meet with this cash

1314
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:18,239
I am the devil watching this guy needs to be on my team holyshit

1315
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:22,847
Tip of the spear guys of number one draft pick

1316
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:29,247
Giada actual violent confrontation clearly all we need to do is presenting

1317
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,855
A minor annoyance to him and he will walk away yet it seems this seems like

1318
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
Achilles heel

1319
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
I Got A Car

1320
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:45,631
This really hurts

1321
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,935
Whatever you want

1322
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:52,287
It's not actually my cut of mild irritation

1323
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,335
Oh man

1324
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
I think I have a little bit of a reaction

1325
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
Haha

1326
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
Why

1327
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
I work for him I would not let him

1328
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:11,743
Come now go away go away left the show you're done you're done

1329
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
Like there should be that kind of level of like that

1330
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,655
Who does work at Infowars apparently

1331
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,191
You quit you're a quitter

1332
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
You're not going back on the air today

1333
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,543
No you don't get to have a tantrum and then come back up

1334
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:29,663
Pretend nothing happened would you accept this kind of behavior at a little league game

1335
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
Absolutely not no

1336
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
If you're the coach

1337
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
No

1338
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,807
This is disgraceful Behavior

1339
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,575
Hey hey

1340
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,975
Okay I know you made an error on that play and then stormed off the field and we had to replace you with a new short

1341
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
What's a butt

1342
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,071
Now that it's a couple outs later of course you can go back into the game

1343
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:51,167
You yelled I'm not mad while throwing your fat at the opposing team

1344
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,263
Umpire has to have knee replacement surgery

1345
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,079
Valex comes back with a very exciting enough

1346
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
I can trust rated because

1347
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Covered

1348
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,967
20% of what I was ready to cover

1349
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
A lot of

1350
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,903
Today

1351
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Great

1352
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
F***

1353
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,999
You stupid

1354
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
How to do a job a lot of your time on my show and now.

1355
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:29,823
Time on somebody else's show spend a lot of time lying about nda's and meetings are globalist

1356
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,639
I did have a little baby freak out

1357
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Bad I left the show

1358
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
You

1359
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
Baby freak out

1360
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:44,927
Don't you forget that I do all running everything. We don't tell anybody. Everybody was

1361
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,487
Said that

1362
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,791
I like the idea that

1363
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,583
These two things are

1364
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,863
Geniusly crew

1365
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,655
Alex Jones is the most

1366
01:08:54,911 --> 01:09:01,055
Important truth-teller in the world he has a singular ability to understand the globalist right away that nobody else

1367
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,127
In human history has ever been able to over two decades

1368
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
That's the first

1369
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,455
The second thing

1370
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
Is he

1371
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
6 minutes

1372
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,527
Plaid Justice

1373
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Vine

1374
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
Did let his

1375
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,135
Engineer decide what to play on it

1376
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
Brittany stores

1377
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
Play whatever you want

1378
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Summer intern

1379
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,047
But he has higher just some random person

1380
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
Their instinct is going to be as good as mine

1381
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,375
Coof

1382
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
ISO

1383
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,239
F*** Alex I'm not going to listen to the war room for him to come back and try again

1384
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,031
Absolutely not

1385
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
So we we go to the 12

1386
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,847
Call Pierre and

1387
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
You know we didn't

1388
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,431
Didn't have martial law break

1389
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
That's true

1390
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,551
And also the Cyber Symposium the bike on Dallas putting on his

1391
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Mighty display

1392
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
Here's where Alex is at

1393
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,439
But this is a softgel weapon

1394
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,743
Differently

1395
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,607
Absolutely so evil and so well thought-out

1396
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,655
Premeditated

1397
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,471
Verizon

1398
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
Hydrogen bomb going off you know what

1399
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Bud

1400
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:08,895
With this because it's a slow kill

1401
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
Because it's a soft kill

1402
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,295
People don't know

1403
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
What is hemp

1404
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:21,439
Silent weapons for quiet Wars

1405
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
That's not a pentagon report

1406
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Document

1407
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
Alex

1408
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
Real

1409
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Amazing

1410
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,703
In the year of Our Lord 2021 Alex

1411
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,495
Is such a dumb dumb

1412
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,543
He's willing to site silent weapons

1413
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
For quiet Wars

1414
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
Amazing

1415
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
These guys

1416
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,991
Do they think this one is

1417
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,319
Going to be the last one or do they think they're going to be able to

1418
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
Do you know what I mean like

1419
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Eventually it's going to be a year from now

1420
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,487
And the people who have gotten the vaccine

1421
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,815
There will be more of them and they will all still not be dead

1422
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,375
So what did they do then

1423
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,727
I think that what you do then is you pretend that all

1424
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,495
Bullmastiff

1425
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Is being covered up

1426
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:13,407
And you make a mountain out of a molehill anytime there's any kind of adversity or event that happen

1427
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,991
I think that's probably the the strategy at that point

1428
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,831
I don't trip but I mean this one is just so big you know it feels like

1429
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,111
You can't wriggle out of

1430
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:22,879
Hey

1431
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,183
80% of people are going to be dead

1432
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,975
In six months yeah

1433
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,743
If you know

1434
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,791
I agree with you

1435
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,839
It in terms of like rational mine

1436
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,887
I think that

1437
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,703
I think that you and I can look at this and say like

1438
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,495
There's no way out of this

1439
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,543
There's no there's no doubling back

1440
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
Yeah but

1441
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:45,663
I would have said that a hundred times over the course of Alex's G I have said

1442
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,199
On this show even like

1443
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
But he's f***** yeah

1444
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,831
How's it going to get out of this it's a dead-end narrative know you're right

1445
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Bigger than anything I've seen him try to pull off in

1446
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
In the past

1447
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
But I don't

1448
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,791
As long as there's money I don't know

1449
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
What

1450
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:09,215
I understand how old I am 34 now I have not gone two years of my life without some Christian cell

1451
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
Telling me it's the end time

1452
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
So of course they're willing to just

1453
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
So it's not this time

1454
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,639
We'll wait until the next one in this time

1455
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
It's the end times

1456
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
Yeah I think I think

1457
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
Vets

1458
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,295
Alex is the Arbiter of information in

1459
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,831
And so

1460
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
In Subway's

1461
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
As long as

1462
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,439
He's able to feign confidence

1463
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,743
In whatever way he walks

1464
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,815
Back stuff pretends that he's not actually wrong

1465
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Right

1466
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,863
I think that he was able to

1467
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,423
He'll be able to keep up some amount of the auto

1468
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
Yeah you're right

1469
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
People who

1470
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
Float away

1471
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
As long as there's money

1472
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,383
Ill Bill tricks on people

1473
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
If I were them I would be working on my walk back strategy now started a year ago

1474
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:00,671
How are we going to pull this off it's going to take us a lot of nights to figure this one out

1475
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,839
Is the sort of thing that I'd have a flow chart for multiple steps ahead

1476
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
On the 12th

1477
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,167
There was a bit of

1478
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,799
Stuff going around on social media about one of these nice Alex was right about everything kind of money

1479
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,847
About

1480
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Judicial Watch

1481
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,431
Center for Medical

1482
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Call progress

1483
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:27,295
Release of some documents about the University of Pittsburgh

1484
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
Procuring

1485
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
Fetuses for Reese

1486
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
Sure okay

1487
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,719
Fun it's not really a bombshell in anyway but Alex

1488
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,791
Of course because people talk about how he was right about everything

1489
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
He's got to cover it

1490
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Here's Fox News

1491
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
Here's Associated Press

1492
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Today

1493
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,311
Criminal investigation by the justice department on whether major universities

1494
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Did they deliver 3rd

1495
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,015
789 Montana

1496
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,927
Peter poor women sometimes it show up at the hospital

1497
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,999
And and

1498
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,351
So this is Billy inaccurate

1499
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
But it gets worse

1500
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
What was Elvis in the documents

1501
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,519
That they wanted

1502
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,639
Minority babies they don't say why in California in Ohio and New York

1503
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Illinois

1504
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
We want black and brown

1505
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,855
Hey buddy if I say the wrong thing on the right swipe

1506
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
Harvesting

1507
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:48,447
So like I said this story is just about to documents released by Judicial Watch and the Center for Medical progress

1508
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,543
Both of these entities are pretty Usual Suspects on our show and Arkham

1509
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,335
Complete should have they should never be trusted

1510
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,919
The one element of the story that stuck out is this second

1511
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
Appear

1512
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
Folks

1513
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:05,599
They really glommed onto it's this specific details that they're these great documents that require

1514
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:08,927
Some of the fetuses percentage of them that they take in

1515
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,207
Abba need to be Democrat

1516
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,231
Ethically diverse

1517
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,535
Anyone who's not a s******* grifter would be able

1518
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
I'll tell you this isn't an attempt

1519
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,095
The target minorities

1520
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,191
Keeping in line with making sure that the studies that they carry out follow property

1521
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,215
Distribution pattern

1522
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,519
So SB reflective of the general

1523
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,335
Just like with Dennis Montgomery

1524
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,895
Judicial Watch instead of medical progress or names

1525
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,223
That you should the Akira X to a story and you should just ignore it

1526
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,807
There's never going to be anything worth wild comes out

1527
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,207
Every single time that I've heard their names associated with stories there is a simple explanation

1528
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
For how there

1529
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
Intentionally misrepresenting something

1530
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
Push-up political am

1531
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
Yeah

1532
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
Every time

1533
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
Project Veritas

1534
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,679
Course all of these names

1535
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
Ignorable

1536
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:53,983
Exact

1537
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
The opposite problem that's

1538
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:59,103
Like the problem that's being addressed is far larger which

1539
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
What is that most

1540
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
Medical testing over

1541
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Our history

1542
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:05,759
Has been done on white men so we know exhaustively

1543
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
What works for white dudes butt

1544
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,623
Medications for women and for minorities

1545
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:17,023
Have been under understudy because they're not a milia concern problem

1546
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,839
Finally trying to do something about it and of course

1547
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,887
It's turned into an evil f***

1548
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
There's just no there's

1549
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,495
Nothing they can't f******

1550
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
Speaking of which

1551
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,079
Here's Alex messing around with

1552
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Photography

1553
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:38,271
The major national gay pride organization just gave their highest award to an image

1554
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,575
Of a toddler child

1555
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,879
With men in bondage uniforms

1556
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,927
With sex swings

1557
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,743
But they put themselves in

1558
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,351
This is with a two-year-old child

1559
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
And they're all lined up

1560
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
And then the messages were about to g*******

1561
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:06,175
Weird message

1562
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,319
Pdsm

1563
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,647
There's a right-wing media outrage cycle those k

1564
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,975
Kicked off this traces back to a tweet

1565
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,511
Does posted by Andino

1566
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,839
Who's another name you can add to that list people

1567
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,607
You should probably just

1568
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Signor

1569
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,703
Apparently during pride in the Netherlands

1570
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,263
There was a contest taking photos that capture the years

1571
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,543
Theme of celebrating diverse

1572
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:37,151
50 photos were selected and this one was one that particularly stood out

1573
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,247
According to the post-millennial which is a source I generally would never site

1574
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
But no one else is covering

1575
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,295
In the stone story

1576
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,087
The jury's out of this picture quote

1577
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
This photo in a

1578
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,439
Its composition child in the foreground men preparing for

1579
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Canal parade in the background

1580
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,791
Everyone busy with their own activities and fascination

1581
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,119
Sublimely depicts what will hopefully remain self-evident

1582
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,471
That we unhampered by prejudices and almost unsuspectingly

1583
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,287
All met and can exist side-by-side

1584
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,871
I seen this picture and that seems like a pretty decent take on it

1585
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:12,479
Certainly that's closer to what I experiencing the photo that Alex is interpretation which is just

1586
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
Disgusting on

1587
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Yeah

1588
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Yeah

1589
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:21,695
There's just no way around if that's what you think is about to happen that's cuz you're.

1590
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,999
Yeah you're a monster

1591
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
Reminder standing

1592
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
The picture is a child

1593
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,423
Holding a swing

1594
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
Yeah like I'd like a

1595
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Playground swing

1596
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Swing

1597
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,847
And then there's people in leather

1598
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:44,223
Behind right there not like all looking at her anything girl minding their business or like getting there

1599
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:49,087
Stuff latched going to have you and any picture about how prejudices learn

1600
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,159
Yeah and the situation to was that the child mother

1601
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,975
Had let these people change

1602
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
To go to the parade

1603
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,535
At her home

1604
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Answer

1605
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
It's done getting ready

1606
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,863
Need to go to the dealer

1607
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
We're going to

1608
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,471
It's just

1609
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,519
No that's because you're that's

1610
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
If that's you

1611
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:09,823
That's what you get

1612
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
You are disgusting and you should deal with that

1613
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,455
I am sick of having to deal with the fact that you can't deal with

1614
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:20,831
Anytime there's an adult and a child in the same room that you don't like them

1615
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,415
I have a difficult time with these projection

1616
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Yeah

1617
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,975
Yeah so Alex

1618
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
WhatsApp

1619
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,047
What's the one word that Alex uses

1620
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,327
To describe

1621
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
Doctors that he likes pennies

1622
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,143
No

1623
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
Doctor

1624
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:39,775
I would have to go with well-respected top of his

1625
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:46,175
Field close close

1626
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,271
Damn it that's that's his favorite word

1627
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,807
Talk about a prestigious doctor

1628
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,855
I am.

1629
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:57,183
Another prestigious dr. Fleming

1630
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,999
Vaccines are biological weapons

1631
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
When

1632
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
This virus

1633
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Is a man-made

1634
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,703
Gain-of-function virus

1635
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Paid for by us tax

1636
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Taxpayers dollars including

1637
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
Money stacks

1638
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Department of

1639
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Defense

1640
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:19,456
Del bigtree is an anti-vaxxer lunatic so if someone's being interviewed by him AIDS

1641
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,504
Pretty safe bet that they're not on the level

1642
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,576
In this case though out to sing with this guy is really

1643
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
Prestigious

1644
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
I thought I'd

1645
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
Thought-out short

1646
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:30,464
As it turns out Richard and plumbing is a bit of a career scammer

1647
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,816
In 2002 he billed Medicare Medicaid and Blue Cross Blue Shield for quote

1648
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,144
Falsely represented medical test

1649
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,752
+ 2,048 submitted false data after being paid

1650
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,032
Performa clinical study

1651
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,848
Call me health benefits of a sweet chip food product

1652
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:53,504
This all Legend being sentenced to five years probation and six months house arrest along with being forced to pay restitution of

1653
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,088
107,000 $244.24

1654
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,952
Hey man you can get jail time for stealing bugging out of Alexa

1655
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:08,352
Yeah I know you stealing from a f****** gas station B of A years-long

1656
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
Scam 5 years probation

1657
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,032
Sure that he would probably say that he never admitted to anything and he's totally innocent but he needed

1658
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
Well

1659
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:23,200
Swimming is no quitter those who decide to keep trying to put that studies which ultimately led to the FDA in 2018

1660
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
He was disbarred quote

1661
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,296
Look for 10 years from providing services in

1662
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,904
Any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application

1663
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,488
I know it takes a lot of prestige to get there

1664
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:39,840
This guy is a doctor has no specialty in vaccines or epidemiology at all

1665
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,680
It is somebody who's been charged with multiple fraud-related felonies

1666
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:49,824
I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that that's not the resume or somebody who's one of the most prestigious doctors around

1667
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Yeah

1668
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,896
That somebody who's I don't know

1669
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
One of the most

1670
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Prestigious doctors around it took him 10 years of not being allowed to practice by law

1671
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
In order to

1672
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:06,208
The game the level of prestige the TV prestigious Maverick at the fda's.

1673
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,768
Afraid to have him

1674
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:15,168
Put a legal injunction against him because I'm in India

1675
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
But also if they didn't

1676
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Stop him

1677
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,800
From being involved with these studies in these like trials

1678
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,104
No other doctors could get work

1679
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,920
No that's why the FDA had to step in and just borrow

1680
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,968
Cuz he wouldn't even be doing everything to good

1681
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
Stupid

1682
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,016
Good

1683
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
At doctor

1684
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
So what are they

1685
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,088
Is that Alex has been

1686
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
Dancing around with ease

1687
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
When they said the hospitals were in

1688
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,000
Pool last time

1689
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
It was all bulshit the house

1690
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
Little branch

1691
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,888
Right now hospitals are full and they are actually

1692
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,544
Do they get to go both ways huh and nobody's going to stop them and we're not going to have any consequences for this whatsoever

1693
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,848
This is not the argument that Alex is making

1694
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,128
But it is

1695
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,664
A little bit

1696
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
Unnerving

1697
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
How

1698
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:04,064
It's not being treated as at much of an emergency this time

1699
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,392
I'm part of that maybe

1700
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:13,792
What do you mean from the society at Large

1701
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,400
And I don't know if this is in part because

1702
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
Vaccination

1703
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,056
Prevalent so I don't know if it's

1704
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
Because of poor messaging

1705
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,712
Maybe could be partially or could be the exhaust

1706
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,504
The comes from recognizing that

1707
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
If you are going Alyssa

1708
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:40,416
Like you can yell all you want about the hospitals being full and it being a very severe situation

1709
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
I think that the

1710
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Right to do

1711
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,048
Been talking to change

1712
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,608
Governor DeSantis his behavior

1713
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:52,448
It's not going to change the people like Alex's Behavior at all

1714
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
What the thing that you wouldn't

1715
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
In order to address

1716
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
The problem is an impossibility

1717
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,896
I don't think that that justifies not

1718
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,176
Treating it like

1719
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:05,760
The type of problem that it is so don't know what to do

1720
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,112
Anyway that's a real thing Alex's fake thing

1721
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,440
Is that they were pretending the hospital.

1722
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:18,048
So now they are full because they're filled with vaccinated

1723
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:22,400
People people are actually the ones we're getting everyone

1724
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,192
Prairie right

1725
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,776
Topsy-turvy world but it'll mean we don't really need to deal with this too much

1726
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800
Because Alex kind of

1727
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Gets distracted in

1728
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,848
In the middle

1729
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
Talking about it

1730
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:35,968
Hospitals around the country I could check statistics

1731
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,064
Last year at this time the hospitals were empty

1732
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
What do all the real Carolina

1733
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
Hospitals not operate

1734
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,304
And then

1735
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
Appreciate

1736
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
Awesome

1737
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,664
I guess you're awesome

1738
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,456
Actually I got her.

1739
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,184
Very important

1740
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
I need a Mac and

1741
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,512
I'm just going to stop right there

1742
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
Play whatever you want

1743
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,520
To set up your own ear

1744
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:35,872
And have literally thousands of documents total admission

1745
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:42,528
You pour gasoline on somebody you like them on fire going to burn to death

1746
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,576
Gets back to causal relationships

1747
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,112
Hahaha now we know how

1748
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,952
I get a little worried about myself from time to time

1749
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
Things that prompt

1750
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,280
Worrying me

1751
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:57,376
Is that I think I can understand Alex a little better than I should

1752
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
Because I heard that clip

1753
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:02,752
And when he's breathing heavy and then he's like I have total admission total proof

1754
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:03,776
I like

1755
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
I know what happened

1756
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,128
You got distracted by something you forgot what you were saying

1757
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,432
You forgot you were talking about the hospitals

1758
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:16,064
You are being empty before but they're full now and approve everything

1759
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
He has no connection

1760
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Intuit and he just

1761
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
Like I don't even know where I was

1762
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,976
That's usually where he'll have a

1763
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,512
Breakdown and storm outside

1764
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:28,096
Yeah but in this case he doesn't he tries to to hold it

1765
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,376
Together power through

1766
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,400
And then

1767
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,192
In like a minute after this

1768
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,984
He basically admitted

1769
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Exactly what

1770
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,288
I suspect it was

1771
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:40,128
Too nice to just fly over with helicopters and gases

1772
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,688
Lacoste fires explosions

1773
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
But if it is a cold attack

1774
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,768
People want to rationalize they don't want to believe it's happening they don't

1775
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
Wanna believe it's taking place in their lifetime

1776
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,080
Calm down and try to come back

1777
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,688
How can I guess somebody came through and I forgot I was going to say if I got mad

1778
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:19,040
I got what I thought. After while

1779
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,416
Imma try to reset imma try to come back

1780
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,960
Do you want to hear about him keeping a little kids alive

1781
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:51,552
Alex doesn't want to read those studies because they don't say the things that he needs them to say in order for these new

1782
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,088
Narratives to buy

1783
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,112
Stand up to scrutiny

1784
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,648
That's why he doesn't do that

1785
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,696
I forgot what I was going to say

1786
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,976
So I got mad

1787
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,256
And then that's

1788
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:03,328
Mad is a medical problem

1789
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,632
I think that

1790
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,680
You know

1791
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Acceptance

1792
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,544
And self-awareness is the first step

1793
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,824
In terms of make

1794
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
Making progress

1795
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,968
And for Alex to actually stay on air I lost my train of thought so I got mad

1796
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:26,368
It is certainly better than them storming office

1797
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
True

1798
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:36,352
I don't I don't know I I worry about myself though cuz as soon as I've heard the first clip of it actually happening as I can

1799
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,656
I would love to try to call you getting mad

1800
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,104
This has looked back then

1801
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,880
Thankfully I have candy

1802
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:05,792
That you got a nogga to cut it up. Candy and season the Survivor that I'm not enjoying

1803
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,608
So I'll be okay

1804
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,400
These doctors that Alex

1805
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Looks like I'll hop

1806
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,960
Sober

1807
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,288
Jordan in his prime

1808
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,384
Michael Jordan Nike Jordan Allen

1809
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,200
About 17 playing High School baseball

1810
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Call Jordan

1811
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
Made it to the

1812
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,880
Pinnacle in my profession buddy

1813
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
This is Mississippi

1814
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,768
Give me like having Dale Earnhardt

1815
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,536
Pride

1816
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,584
In his prime

1817
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864
Enterprise

1818
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,960
9 or something

1819
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
Tell you

1820
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:50,080
This car's got a problem if engine is going to blow

1821
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,432
Don't put it out on the track

1822
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,016
Michael Jordan in his prime

1823
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:05,184
That's not a good player I think you should cut him off the team or I don't want them out here with me

1824
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,536
The real quick I want it I want address both of these example

1825
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,120
I don't know if Dale Earnhardt jr. is the best mechanic

1826
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
In the world

1827
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:18,240
Maybe he wouldn't actually be the person you'd want to talk to you about the car itself

1828
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,056
You know something about driving up

1829
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,616
Necessarily know everything about the car

1830
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,896
And Michael Jordan

1831
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:30,272
Is a notorious assholes who said exactly what Alex said he said

1832
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,552
He also wouldn't

1833
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,112
Be the best judge of the best player

1834
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,648
If someone

1835
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Is 2 good

1836
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,584
Murder them

1837
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,680
Good players were complementary to his singular good

1838
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,752
Right Right Alright actually be a very

1839
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,032
Bad person

1840
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,568
Listen to take Staffing advice

1841
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
Scrum

1842
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,128
Yeah I haven't watch The Last Dance

1843
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,176
And also having watched

1844
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:04,576
Jordan's career as a general manager and owner has players

1845
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,880
Like both of these examples are bad

1846
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
Yeah

1847
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,232
How did Dale Earnhardt

1848
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,792
You know what never

1849
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,584
You listen to Michael Jordan

1850
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Michael Jordan

1851
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,936
Earnhardt

1852
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,472
Tom Brady

1853
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:28,128
Another notoriously piece of s*** please was going to happen

1854
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,176
I am in the Twilight Zone

1855
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,272
This morning

1856
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,952
He wasn't trying cuz I

1857
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,024
You do it I'm not going to hurt anybody

1858
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,584
Attacking

1859
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,448
I'm not confident boy

1860
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:55,008
I mean you know

1861
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,800
We already know you want

1862
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,824
How to kill people

1863
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,408
I read these studies and I have tears of murder

1864
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,272
You don't baby the thing that is a metaphor might actually be very good

1865
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
In the opposite direction

1866
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
He's thinking about

1867
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,648
Because I listen three of these people that he is reference

1868
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Are people who are in

1869
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Credible

1870
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,792
Where incredible at what they do

1871
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:21,632
Better than anyone else ever has

1872
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,448
But if you ask them to do something outside of that

1873
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:28,544
You are asking the wrong person no matter what you are doing

1874
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,336
Sure you are asking

1875
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,872
If you are asking a duck

1876
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,408
Shursave who is Ben

1877
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,480
Maybe the best there is ever been in committing fraud

1878
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Fraud

1879
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
Yeah

1880
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:49,792
Yeah singular and that's kind of why when some of them go away there's a real hole in the shower like Steve

1881
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Around more

1882
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,096
He is

1883
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,376
The Michael Jordan

1884
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,680
Of crazy big brag absolutely

1885
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,496
Larry Nichols being dead is

1886
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
Kind of unfortunate

1887
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
Because of the

1888
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:04,896
Hole that's left there he was the Michael Jordan of Clinton conspiracy really was

1889
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,688
He just had them

1890
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,760
And you know you lose those

1891
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,552
You lose those people and it's tough

1892
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,088
It's tough to staff

1893
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,416
And according to Leo zagami he's also the Michael Jordan the basketball

1894
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:19,488
He's the Michael Jordan of Illuminati Insider

1895
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
Championship

1896
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:31,776
It doesn't hit when you try and Slot these other people in who are just diss

1897
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
Disappointing weirdos

1898
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,456
They wish they could be

1899
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,224
Sprite

1900
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,272
That was for a 90 wasn't on the Bulls

1901
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:48,672
Sixth Man of the Year repeatedly

1902
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,464
He was a starter for a while though

1903
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Great

1904
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,536
Good stuff

1905
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
You're talk about Vlade Divac

1906
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
Another bad administrator great basketball player then he became a general manager. Right

1907
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
People who aren't

1908
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:07,360
Good at what they're asking that they

1909
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,200
Glowing basketball

1910
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
Terrible

1911
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,016
So look

1912
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Cyber symposium

1913
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:17,856
How did it go

1914
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,880
It's going well

1915
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
Mul-t-lock

1916
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:23,232
It's a cold

1917
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:28,608
Living in the future I do remember that

1918
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,704
At 90 Supreme Court decision did not come

1919
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
This is a beauty Berry

1920
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
But

1921
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,128
Mike Lindell still hasn't money life

1922
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:43,456
Well and I admire him he's in the arena

1923
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,016
You still fight

1924
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
This

1925
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,088
Next clip

1926
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
It's so gratifying

1927
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
Okay

1928
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,792
Okay Selma

1929
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:58,816
Rihanna

1930
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:02,400
Medias attacking with a cyber Symposium calling it a failure

1931
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,704
A really big success

1932
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,544
Courage and honor in will and Truth

1933
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,336
I watched a lot of it

1934
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:15,712
And reel algorithms real proof shows in real cases of fraud

1935
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:18,528
Warren Lyndell privately and publicly I said

1936
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
In the classic setup

1937
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,488
Even set up a pentagon

1938
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,840
I said you really oughta move away from that

1939
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,168
I said okay

1940
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:39,520
Overshadowing that it was just random.

1941
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:50,272
Alex is trying to throw Dennis Montgomery under the bus but refuses to say his name because he's been a sorceress

1942
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
So many things on April 4th

1943
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,088
Oh man

1944
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,392
Oh man I wore died Warren

1945
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:00,512
Mike Lindell not to listen to the dentist Montgomery's information like I have so many times in the past

1946
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:06,656
Alright I created an entire months-long cycle out of the fictional idea that

1947
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,704
The truck was being spied on based on

1948
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,520
Montgomery information

1949
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:14,592
I can't really throw that out his name

1950
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,384
Make it too obvious that

1951
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,176
But I believe all that b*******

1952
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
I tried to warn lundell

1953
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
He's good guy

1954
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
Things going well

1955
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:26,624
This is Dennis Montgomery is the Nigerian email scammer

1956
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,000
Stories like I told people you know it happened

1957
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,960
Some people named me listen to lunch time

1958
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:43,520
That's cool

1959
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,568
Oh man that's really gratifying for me

1960
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,592
Bike

1961
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,664
Even Alex has got a cup

1962
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,456
Montgomery Lewis now

1963
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,992
Mike Lindell

1964
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,272
You know this is Venice

1965
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:59,904
Success in a lot of ways the updates honor all the other ways other than the ones

1966
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,696
Wyatt by which we would measure

1967
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
It's a party

1968
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,536
Participation trophy is what Alex

1969
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
Would like to give

1970
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
For Honor

1971
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,656
He's Miss Congeniality

1972
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
So Alex

1973
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,264
Gets to talk about the the old vaccines

1974
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,056
Of course and

1975
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,104
He's not learned the name of

1976
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,872
The first man

1977
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,664
Who got the Pfizer shot

1978
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:26,784
First man eroded William Shakespeare

1979
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,576
The first name William

1980
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:35,488
But your mom

1981
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
William Shakespeare

1982
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,072
First he died

1983
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,864
Rabbi William

1984
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:44,192
Do you want to help everybody

1985
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,288
If this dude has descended William Shakespeare it's got to be like

1986
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,848
Make a really bizarre distant relative

1987
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,664
It's got it with the kind of relationship would be meaningless

1988
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,224
William Shakespeare had three children

1989
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,320
Only one of them retain the surname Shakespeare and that was his son Hamlet

1990
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,112
Haven't had no children

1991
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,416
Because he died at age 11

1992
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:07,232
Shakespeare two daughters both married and took on their husband

1993
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,000
Open surname

1994
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,816
His daughter Judith Mary Thomas Queenie

1995
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,632
Children all of whom died

1996
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,936
Before having kids of their own and all before the age of

1997
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
21

1998
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:21,568
His other daughter Susanna married John Hall and had one child named Elizabeth

1999
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:27,200
Elizabeth had no children and is widely known as William Shakespeare's final descendant

2000
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:33,600
I was just all the name William Shakespeare and decided to write a fun story about how he's a descendant of the playwright to make it more compelling for the

2001
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,440
This is something pretty important to recognize that Alex's process

2002
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,744
It very regularly involves him just making

2003
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,792
King stuff up as he's cold reading articles

2004
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,680
Also if you read any of the articles about this guy our to know that he's very strongly prefer being called bill

2005
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,728
Most likely because of the discomfort

2006
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,752
Being named Williams

2007
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:55,104
That's somebody with the last name Holmes nobody has ever called me Shirley

2008
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,920
Block so I don't understand h a

2009
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:02,528
Chicago called H H Holmes

2010
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:07,136
Is it really is most people don't like to reference famous serial killers when talking

2011
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,464
Aurora shooter

2012
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
The world government

2013
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,328
Haha

2014
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,352
Going to take over

2015
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
But there's one

2016
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
Achilles heel

2017
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,264
Memes white people but he doesn't want to say that

2018
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:29,920
The whole world government rollout forced inoculation program

2019
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:36,320
Little bit of an Achilles heel

2020
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:40,672
Western Europe in the UK and Australia and New Zealand in

2021
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,976
Supposedly have election

2022
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,560
Those countries have democracy

2023
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:50,400
You're able to put

2024
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,032
Sure thing list

2025
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,848
Countries that Alex's saying are the Achilles heel of the globalist

2026
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
It's because there were

2027
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,384
Publix

2028
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,456
It does seem like a very

2029
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
Ties them together feel like

2030
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:13,440
UK vs rights bit of a misstep

2031
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Since the UK is considered a

2032
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,000
Constitutional monarchy

2033
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,840
Don't generally considered a formality today technically

2034
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:22,400
In order for any Bill to become an Act of Parliament

2035
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,448
Required to get Royal assent

2036
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,728
Which is the monarchs

2037
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:32,128
Approval and literally stories have come out recently of the monarchs themselves changing legislation

2038
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:38,528
Can using their influence this actually like at the Royal assent not being granted to a bill hasn't happened since the sea

2039
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,296
1700

2040
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,600
And if it did today would almost certainly prompt

2041
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:48,256
But in terms of the law and how the government is organized in the UK the Monarch has the power to override everything

2042
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,048
Any elected body does

2043
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,632
The UK is not a republic

2044
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
How funny would it be

2045
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:55,936
If

2046
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:01,056
The queen just finally did that one time it seemed like the perfect everybody's like I guess we have to

2047
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:05,920
Killer now that was a strange way for that rule to end and guess what Jordan

2048
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:09,760
Elizabeth is the queen of Australia to

2049
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:13,856
Are there laws redacted with royal assent as well although it's done by the Australian

2050
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,880
Governor-general

2051
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,696
The governor-general is not an elected position it's a

2052
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,232
Appointed by the monarch

2053
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:21,536
This is one of the heads of state and they surface

2054
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,328
Pleasure of the British crown

2055
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,656
Canada

2056
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,960
Stupid world do we live in

2057
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,496
Stupid

2058
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,776
Bulshit is this

2059
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,080
So f****** stupid

2060
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,896
It's kind of bizarre like

2061
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:39,200
I think that they're still like effective governor

2062
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,224
It's able to

2063
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,528
Take this new constitutional monarchy

2064
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:48,928
But it seems like something we should just do away with

2065
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,976
Heads of state who are kingma's in

2066
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
And queens

2067
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,512
Who

2068
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:59,168
Technically on paper control everything if they want to but yet

2069
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:01,728
That's where we're here to make appearances

2070
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:07,872
Live extremely lavish Lifestyles at the expense of all the poor people around us as we learned

2071
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
From Trump

2072
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,712
Norms are not

2073
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
Set in stone

2074
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,528
And if there is a norm

2075
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:16,064
That the monarchy does

2076
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,880
Give Royal assent to everything

2077
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,184
That's not setting cell

2078
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,512
The only as good as the monarch

2079
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:30,912
Hey well and not just that but we're seeing a Resurgence of a lot of far-right monarchist at the moments

2080
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:35,008
If there is a monarch who decides to say remove that event

2081
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:41,408
And has already put together a large group of supporters many of whom are very violent these days

2082
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,480
Took the countries that Alex's listing aren't Republic

2083
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,528
Interesting leads do that list

2084
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
But he gave his

2085
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:51,904
Really similar to the countries that Kirk Lions noted Neo-Nazi lawyer

2086
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,696
Listed is the ones where the white

2087
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,744
Majority was under attack

2088
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,024
Do use the acronym

2089
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,120
Cause which you used as the new name for his organization which was formerly known as

2090
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
The Patriots

2091
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,912
Defense Foundation

2092
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:08,288
It's better than the white people only we love white people white people white people

2093
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Alex

2094
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,848
Don't care about these countries cuz they were public

2095
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,224
He cares because he believes that there the places where white people are in danger because his intellectual roots

2096
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,296
Orion extreme right-wing racist ideology

2097
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
Whether he's aware of it or

2098
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,160
So

2099
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
The thing that I love

2100
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,464
About this

2101
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,488
Episode in

2102
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Secular

2103
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,816
Is that Alex has to rationalize

2104
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,864
That the Cyber Symposium is not going

2105
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
It's not going

2106
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:37,728
But it is going well

2107
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:41,056
You have money and I have a promo code everything he's ever done

2108
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,616
But at the same time it looks pretty bad this is not going

2109
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:47,456
And it's only because Dennis Montgomery set him up

2110
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:52,320
Globalist

2111
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,696
But Alex has to say his name

2112
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,256
We knew how they did it they sent out all the

2113
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,280
Balance

2114
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,328
I sent out tens of millions album

2115
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
From North Korea

2116
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:08,704
Put on a boat

2117
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:10,240
Glendale

2118
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Theirself

2119
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
But just like I told you to was control

2120
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,720
How do you

2121
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,488
Shredded

2122
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,792
Somebody that's actually out there

2123
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,328
Trying to expose

2124
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
Will stop while you tell him

2125
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,936
We've got all the files of all the election

2126
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,960
Symptoms China

2127
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,776
Prove

2128
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,384
So now Dennis Montgomery

2129
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,456
Giving this information to Mike Lindell is a plot

2130
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,480
The globalist

2131
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,528
To discredit Mike Lindell

2132
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,576
And the guy pushed

2133
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,856
To overturn the election

2134
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
Amazing

2135
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,672
Does he not realize

2136
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,208
What he just say

2137
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,488
Probably not

2138
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,768
He rarely does

2139
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,560
Because what he just said

2140
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,864
Was that you can give

2141
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
Mike Lindell

2142
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,216
Fake information and he will put it out

2143
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
Because he does not have the ability

2144
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,080
The tell the difference between fake information or real in

2145
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,664
Yeah that is that is definitely a piece of this that is

2146
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,200
Is going on examine

2147
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:29,856
Yeah and Mike Lindell will make multiple documentaries about this risk a 1.6 billion dollar lawsuit

2148
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,392
I mean

2149
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:34,976
It really doesn't get that what you just said is that we don't

2150
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,304
Don't know how to tell the difference between real information and fake information

2151
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:41,888
Yep no way of verifying whether or not the ship people give us

2152
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,936
Is true yeah and

2153
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:48,800
The fact that this information is coming from someone who is a career scam artist

2154
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
Pause

2155
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,736
Past behavior is not a predictor of future of a

2156
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,552
Also I love

2157
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,600
The premise that Alex like

2158
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,672
Is like I'm not going to say his name cuz I do want to get sued when I gets

2159
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,048
He goes on to s*** on

2160
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,584
Montgomery Sommore

2161
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,632
All that smile he said he had

2162
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:16,704
Individual that gave it to him but said that

2163
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,984
China

2164
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
All the files and did it

2165
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:23,616
Obviously you can't have all the files at once

2166
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,040
Individual

2167
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:35,136
Courseworks for the mccratic party of the biggest Democratic party Law Firm

2168
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,928
Affirmative quarterback

2169
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,208
Operations against me

2170
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:42,048
Oh my God

2171
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,864
But Linda listen to me and that's okay he's a good guy

2172
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,656
Level

2173
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,960
He'll remember what I told him now

2174
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:54,080
Exclusive

2175
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,872
Modell's planes in China

2176
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
Election

2177
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:02,272
Who gave Michael until all this information is NPR headlines

2178
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,808
Call the Pentagon

2179
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,856
Politics in

2180
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,048
Kind of messages on broadcast TV

2181
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,352
Report

2182
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,704
Summertime CIA Pentagon into buying

2183
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
Artist

2184
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,456
1010

2185
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,992
Involving Judge

2186
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,552
Have you ever talked about tennis

2187
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,088
We have

2188
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,184
All of this information

2189
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:41,952
Yeah that

2190
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:48,352
That seems really absent from his analysis of this is the conversation of all of the

2191
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,632
Fraudulent

2192
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,448
Based on this

2193
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Guy who's in

2194
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,752
An obvious scam artists

2195
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,800
You know it's it's fun

2196
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:03,200
How many times people are like Alex was right but we don't have that like you do when a cop gets caught play

2197
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
Planting drugs

2198
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,296
You know and then they have to go back and revisit all those old

2199
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Convictions and toss them out

2200
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:15,232
Because the cop is clearly a f****** cheaters like Alex should have to go back and revisit all those dentist

2201
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:18,048
Gomery cases be like well this one's from a Canard

2202
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,352
This one's from a con artist this one's from Baccano

2203
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:26,496
Right I mean even the basis of this one Alex is on board with a hammer and scorecard stuff

2204
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,568
He definitely was promoting that was

2205
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,128
Straight up Montgomery s***

2206
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,664
The problem is

2207
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,200
It was too big

2208
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,480
So people paid attention

2209
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
Yeah I think it was easier for him to

2210
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,832
Assertive pretend he wasn't aware of

2211
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,624
How much of a hoax artist

2212
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,928
Montgomery was back then

2213
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
You know there was a

2214
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,000
Trump was President there was a good chance

2215
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,560
G.i. Joe Arpaio pardon

2216
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
No

2217
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,888
And the tides of change

2218
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,424
Montgomery is a

2219
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,704
And everybody knows it

2220
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,264
I won't say his name because I don't get to

2221
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,288
Or

2222
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:03,360
I don't want to trigger something in people's memories

2223
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,432
I remember you talking about this guy

2224
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,736
As if he was the Super snowed in

2225
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:13,344
Didn't seem to recall somebody saying super Snowden

2226
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:16,416
About somewhere Bunch times

2227
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,488
So Alex interviews this talk show host

2228
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:23,328
Name Katie your Kate daily dolly

2229
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,352
I don't know

2230
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,376
That's fine

2231
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,192
Cheese

2232
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:32,800
I would say that she's somebody who's talks in Infowars content

2233
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,872
Okay with a Fox News delivery

2234
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,896
I got you

2235
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,920
Junior varsity

2236
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:39,968
She is not

2237
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,016
Did Michael Jordan have

2238
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,856
She is the bill wennington

2239
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:46,880
That's not great

2240
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,904
Luc Longley

2241
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,952
It look like we was great

2242
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,512
Yeah it was pretty good that's a bad example

2243
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:57,632
All over my boobs now I can't think of any other people who were on the boat with that point

2244
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:04,032
B.j. Armstrong but he was good BJ was good

2245
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,824
I was asked by Michael Jordan which

2246
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:12,224
Proves our earlier theory if you get punched in the face by Michael Jordan you're probably pretty good as some other players on that bad

2247
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:17,600
Give me some other players from the bench yeah man that's not going to go well no

2248
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,624
It's been awhile

2249
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,928
It's been too long Stacy

2250
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,792
No not Stacey

2251
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
Yes yeah I know I know

2252
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,144
Nevermind

2253
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:30,912
I can't remember.

2254
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,192
Alright

2255
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:39,616
Who else we going to Bulls you love them

2256
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,920
Their interview is not very interesting it's mostly to

2257
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,200
Just about

2258
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,272
Basic misrepresentations about covid vaccination

2259
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,552
Seems like we talked about a bunch

2260
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,856
Although we do learn something

2261
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,904
And that is that Rob do was in the hospital

2262
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,976
Oh no

2263
01:50:58,048 --> 01:51:03,424
Dumb f*** I'll explain if you tested negative no matter what that may be possible but barely got some kind of pneumonia

2264
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:06,496
And then he had to escape the hospital

2265
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,800
Which is fun

2266
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,336
Okay

2267
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:13,408
I would probably just ignore this and be like whatever I give it to you

2268
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
But

2269
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,480
Listen to Alex

2270
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,272
Call Rob do a friend

2271
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,296
And there's a little bit of a

2272
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:21,088
Pause that made me very sad

2273
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:24,672
Call Goodwill my best friend's Rob do

2274
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:31,328
Add covid-19 in went to the hospital and they weren't giving him IV

2275
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,632
They weren't giving him vitamin C

2276
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,896
You do

2277
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
Escape

2278
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,760
What do I goodfriends Rob do

2279
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,576
Already had covid

2280
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:56,672
Thought he had covid what a my best friend's Rob do

2281
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,952
That's not like a

2282
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,488
Giant Paws but it's

2283
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,280
Meaningful

2284
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
It feels

2285
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,352
Pointed one could call it pregnant

2286
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,936
I'd also love VIP

2287
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,216
Subdued

2288
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:13,056
Just basically being like what Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

2289
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,896
Getting out I see I see Rob who is Crunk

2290
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:23,296
Ocean theme music of the escapes I could see that I could do that

2291
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:27,136
So he refused this Cave Valley

2292
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,160
And I don't care

2293
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:30,464
Partially that's because

2294
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,232
We have another guy

2295
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:32,768
Use outbrain

2296
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
He's very traumatic

2297
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,584
Any other surprises

2298
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:40,192
Also we've been able to get dr. Richard Fleming

2299
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,472
To join us at

2300
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:44,800
Power if that's alright with you he's

2301
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:55,040
This is what people I've ever interviewed this is the fraud doctor we talked about earlier

2302
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,344
The most brilliant people I have

2303
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,368
Ever interview

2304
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,136
Yes

2305
01:52:59,392 --> 01:52:59,904
He's great

2306
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:03,744
Happening is that

2307
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,536
Halfway through the third hours

2308
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:06,560
And let's Mike

2309
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,400
Like interview this other doctor

2310
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
I like oh my

2311
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,704
My God

2312
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
Breakthrough

2313
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:17,824
He's one who who has ideas

2314
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
I like the way I made that song

2315
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:23,968
He is one who has one who has ideas

2316
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,992
Yes

2317
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,552
And he has idea for the day

2318
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
The office

2319
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,600
Personnel

2320
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,136
Backpack that happened right

2321
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:34,208
China got all of the psychological profiles

2322
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
All of everybody.

2323
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,792
And now they're using it

2324
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:38,816
Kill the military

2325
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:40,864
Would you believe that no

2326
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:45,728
Remember what was in those files they had these psychological profiles

2327
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,544
High-level military leaders including high-level

2328
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,944
In their interviews when they're being interviewed

2329
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:00,576
Do you have multiple sex partners

2330
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:04,928
Records are now in the hands of the CCP

2331
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:08,256
2

2332
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:11,072
High-level officials in

2333
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:16,192
With the people's Liberation Army

2334
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,216
War

2335
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:19,520
Against the United States military to then

2336
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,568
Military

2337
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:26,432
By having our own troops with Spike weapon

2338
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,576
In the name of vaccines

2339
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:36,160
While emerging Global Center China

2340
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,208
Spy Car trips

2341
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,256
Poison them

2342
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:43,328
As an Armistice as a sign of submission

2343
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,632
Love working together

2344
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
Spiritual

2345
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:50,496
They're good they're Jordan and Pippen

2346
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:55,616
I said something crazy even crazier

2347
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,968
Love the way you're not

2348
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,016
It does seem to have a little bit of a

2349
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:05,600
Chocolate and peanut butter Vive 20s

2350
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,648
Oh man you know like

2351
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,720
You take the content away from it there's something really delightful about the

2352
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,256
Cute it's just

2353
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,280
I mean

2354
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:18,656
Doesn't it seem too much doesn't it seem too much to return your anti-vax

2355
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,680
Bulshit from

2356
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,448
You do like

2357
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,728
It's it's

2358
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:25,824
Reasonable to trick people into thinking that something you some kind of birth

2359
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:32,224
Defect or something can happen because of vaccine

2360
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,504
And then a kid riddles

2361
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,064
Pretty easy to present like

2362
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,088
I have a can

2363
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,368
Concerned about this

2364
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,648
Concern is legitimate

2365
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:43,232
There's some science that I feel is unclear or whatever

2366
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,768
Deams Lake

2367
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:51,680
More on Shaky Ground and this about 70% of the population

2368
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,216
Has had at least one shot

2369
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Yeah right

2370
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,288
So now you're going to take anti-vax

2371
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:59,872
Bulshit out of the realm of that and turned it into

2372
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:06,272
All of the people in our military are being murdered by the Chinese Army

2373
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
Used

2374
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:09,600
Psychological profiles of everybody

2375
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
That they hacked

2376
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,440
Yeah they know how many people are f******

2377
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:19,072
And they're able to use that in order to get them to vaccinate

2378
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,352
The troops so they die

2379
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,376
And here's the point

2380
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:27,776
Here's here's a quick question question

2381
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:31,360
There's No Pigeons Chinese military been vaccinated

2382
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,200
And if so are they being murdered as well.

2383
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,224
Okay listen

2384
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,760
Here's the deal

2385
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,296
Where's this weed

2386
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,320
I suppose

2387
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,344
China invading

2388
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,720
A lot of details to share here but

2389
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,512
There are people

2390
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,048
And and

2391
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
I'm not sure about

2392
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:57,472
But for those who believe that Trump might one day be reinstated by a Supreme Court decision

2393
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:59,776
Erratically

2394
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,336
Trump would inherit a weekend

2395
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,944
Military with probably hundreds of thousands of dead and injured troops

2396
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:10,784
National Security level

2397
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,856
Which would mean the US couldn't defend itself against

2398
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:16,416
Invasion

2399
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:21,792
Better Connecticut

2400
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,072
You nailed it

2401
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,120
Invasion

2402
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,704
United States

2403
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,008
Is the most unavailable country

2404
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,032
In the world

2405
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,824
Every child

2406
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,408
Huge margin do you know what we don't need a military whatsoever

2407
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,992
Cuz we have so many f****** nukes

2408
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:43,040
The idea of somebody being like

2409
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:47,136
Let's go take Utah is insane Beyond Reason

2410
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:53,536
The idea of a staging ground being possible would be really difficult

2411
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,584
Well I mean if your

2412
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,352
Boat

2413
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,376
Maybe in

2414
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:59,936
The Northeast coming from

2415
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:06,336
North Korea going to land in Mexico and then

2416
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,688
Travel upwards with what kind of insane person I said

2417
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,480
America can be invaded

2418
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:18,880
If you believe that that's possible then you have to believe that either Canada or Mexico would be on board

2419
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,160
Bored with the invasion

2420
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:23,744
Or that it would be somehow possible to do a maritime Landing

2421
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:26,560
One thing United States coastline

2422
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:29,120
The United States coastline

2423
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,448
Thunder under cover of dark

2424
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,288
Yeah it seems a little bit far-fetched but if possible

2425
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:40,640
Troops get back

2426
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,944
I mean Jesus Christ

2427
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,504
We've already been invaded in the

2428
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,808
These people are

2429
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,088
Really fun

2430
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,112
Mike is fun

2431
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,928
I guess as much as like

2432
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,488
I abhor all of these people's beliefs

2433
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,024
At least Mike is

2434
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:59,584
Trying to walk that line of like

2435
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,632
I know

2436
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,424
That it would sound really stupid

2437
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:09,312
For me to say that I believe that Trump is going to be reinstated by the Supreme Court at some point

2438
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,080
But

2439
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
The Chinese military

2440
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,224
The brass

2441
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
Into injecting

2442
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:22,368
The troops with vaccines in order to weaken them so when Trump is reinstated by

2443
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:29,280
If you won't have the military wedding pallet ideas

2444
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,816
That makes perfect sense

2445
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,608
Text that makes

2446
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:34,656
Perfect said what a f******

2447
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,936
Mdec unreal

2448
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:39,008
I'm still actually worried about the country being invaded

2449
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:42,848
That's a real thing that people are worried about his troops

2450
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,712
Autumn arrogance Oilers other things to worry about to like societal collapse

2451
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:49,760
Well that seems far more likely

2452
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,296
Well not this version

2453
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,112
And there is a critical Tipping Point

2454
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,440
Beyond which if you have a certain percentage of

2455
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,072
Then Society the complex society that we now live in ceases to function

2456
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:05,888
Because you lost the redundancy and the know-how

2457
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,680
The people who can run

2458
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:10,752
The power grid

2459
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:12,544
Who can run the manufacturing

2460
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:14,592
Machine for the transportation system

2461
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:20,992
If we start to lose twenty-five 30% of those were vaccinated

2462
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:25,088
There may be a Tipping Point Beyond which this entire system suffers a

2463
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
Cascading systemic

2464
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:30,464
Collapse from which we are not able to

2465
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:42,752
Yeah I would say if 14 people in the country dies

2466
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:50,944
There will be a massive reorganization that will be required

2467
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,016
Twenty-five percent of the population of this country.

2468
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,576
It's always fascinating to me

2469
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:59,392
It's always fascinating to me how these guys are

2470
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,184
Capitalists are always like off

2471
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,952
If 20

2472
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:06,560
5% of the people with know how the engineers you know how to run the power grader bills

2473
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:07,840
People are taking away

2474
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:08,608
It's never like

2475
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,936
If 25% of the owners of these businesses die

2476
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,472
It'll all fall apart

2477
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:19,872
Here's another thing to help Mike historical society's going to collapse entirely

2478
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,152
To the 1800's interim

2479
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:24,224
The technology of 25% of the population dies off

2480
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,528
Right

2481
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:27,808
Meanwhile

2482
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:33,696
Essential piece of his analysis conspiracy is it the globalists are trying to kill off 80% of the population

2483
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,744
Ninety percent of the population

2484
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:42,144
I guess the goal was to want to live in a world of 89 technology or something

2485
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,680
They love horses and buggy

2486
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,216
None of this makes any f******

2487
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:52,384
Mike interviews with dr. Fleming guy

2488
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,664
Hear what he says

2489
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,200
No I don't give a s***

2490
02:01:55,456 --> 02:02:01,600
If you had your license revoked for a license for being involved in the study

2491
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
Disbarred

2492
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,648
Primanti Vig

2493
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,672
For even like

2494
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,440
6 months

2495
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:08,000
I would be like

2496
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:09,280
And this was 10 years

2497
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,816
Has he committed multiple

2498
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,096
Bullfrog related felony

2499
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,376
Yeah

2500
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:19,520
Sia I don't really care as you're saying the same kind of standard Infowars covid conspiracy is it just like oh

2501
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:24,640
We have a new face to repeat after us we have a doctors saying it

2502
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,176
A prestigious doctor

2503
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,992
Don't look at them don't don't worry about his

2504
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:29,760
Is as resume

2505
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:32,832
Prestige is actually how

2506
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:36,416
He leaves halfway through the third hour and then Mike

2507
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,184
Who's hosting

2508
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,720
I listen to the rest

2509
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:42,048
For the third hour and I'm not losing you another hour of Mike Adams

2510
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,072
I turned it off

2511
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,864
Only thing I even came

2512
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,912
Close to being interesting as this

2513
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,704
Of Plumbing

2514
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,496
There's very clear

2515
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,800
Evidence that serves Kobe

2516
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,080
2002 was actually the

2517
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,104
Their first bioweapon

2518
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,640
And this isn't

2519
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:57,664
Version

2520
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:00,480
Bio weapon isn't something

2521
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,552
You really are good with what

2522
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,576
Kill the enemy

2523
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:07,392
Slowly but surely demoralizes them

2524
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,416
Arms

2525
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:13,024
Damages their society and their

2526
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:13,792
Economy Inn

2527
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,352
Causes slow malicious diseases

2528
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:17,376
But doesn't make any sense

2529
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:21,728
I mean I guess the best weapon in the world then was George W bush

2530
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,800
Cuz he destroyed societies

2531
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,384
And cause all kinds of masses

2532
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
Diseases in

2533
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:30,688
Yeah

2534
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,224
I mean you know I think

2535
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,248
If you look at

2536
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,040
Particularly

2537
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:35,808
Prominent

2538
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,344
Biological age

2539
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:39,648
Yeah you looking at things like anthrax

2540
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
Yeah

2541
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,184
Doesn't count

2542
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,744
Hold on

2543
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:45,024
It demoralizes

2544
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,816
Don't you remember the biggest threat

2545
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:52,704
From anthrax was how demoralized we'd all be

2546
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,544
A lot of biological weapons are actually targeted at crops

2547
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,872
Yeah a lot of them are things that are like fungus is

2548
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,664
End up killing crop

2549
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:07,040
They don't demoralize props starving to death will demoralize you

2550
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:11,392
Well that's true killing people they're aimed at

2551
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
Plants

2552
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:13,696
You still ain't killing

2553
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:17,536
I don't know I don't know

2554
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:21,632
That sounds more like a propaganda strategies I would like

2555
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,912
This guy too

2556
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:23,936

Loving but also

2565
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,720
Pretend I never listen to him

2566
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:49,792
So where are we

2567
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:53,632

2570
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,824
Utterly embarrassing blow up with the emergency alert

2571
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,152
Just what I thought of shifts beautiful

2572
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,688
I'm just that

2573
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,224
Tip of the spear

2574
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,528

2578
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,816
