00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
Hey welcome back

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,736
If you were a prospective

5
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
Supreme Court Justice

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Does nominate

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
And I was actually

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,584
Jeanine Pirro Wapner and everything that you thought ever was wrong

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
At like from the moment you were born

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,448
To present day

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,288
You are the dumbest motherfuking pile of garbage in the history of the world

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Right

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
You needed a podcast

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
To bring you back

15
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
To the correct form of

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
Follow-up question how would you describe it

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
You should listen to start my Bethel

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
F****** a rap

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Very funny shows

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,776
Good musical gas barely maybe I would say Elizabeth knowledge fight that's our show

21
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Where I know a lot about Alex Jones

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,968
Call you back I was listening back to the episode that

23
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Marty DeRosa

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
Nothing wrong with that hanging out with him and haven't

25
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
Somebody some fun talking about

26
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
Maybe dumb

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Rowdy Roddy Piper is

28
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
I was

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Do you know it's just because Marty

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Don't know as much

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
About this world

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
It departs where there's like

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,128
Something funny and I would have screamed about and they just didn't get to

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Like when he had his collar who was like I married into the buffet live family that's right if we

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,624
Weird if we heard that clip would have been outrageous

36
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,536
Glad you're back

37
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,776
I don't think there's a wonder One there but they're correlation definitely suggests that there's something

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,920
He doesn't see fit to subject himself to this b******* so constantly to the point where you're at

39
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Where things are funny

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
Oh yeah

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Thought I guess

42
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Simultaneously

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Dismal

44
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,256
What I wanted to do was I wanted to I didn't know what I wanted to

45
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
Be honest

46
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,960
We haven't put out any new work on the Project Camelot

47
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Right I thought that it was

48
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
2

49
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
You know

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
I do like we do have an obligation

51
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
To talk about present-day stuff

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Until I wanted to cover present day

53
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,064
But I got sidetracked listening to Mondays up haha

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
Honda on Sunday you put Alex Jones without a special report

55
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Where he responded to Joe Rogan responding to him

56
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Sounds just like

57
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,960
Hibiscus already

58
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Beauty

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Joe Rogan's trying

60
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Escape from the back-and-forth of it

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,968
But Alex

62
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
I think

63
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,160
Alien Predator situation no matter who we all lose

64
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
It's all I listen to that and I was

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Like

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
I was overwhelmed by how little I care

67
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,632
We can't go over

68
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
Monday's episode he had a Gaston called a Yo Mama's chest hair

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Until I listen to I was like

70
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
He's just like his

71
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Blogger

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Like Trump

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
It was going to be

74
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Something crazy

75
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Taking her name from line-in

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Girls with

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Take my medication that she

78
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Point that move

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
That's wrong

80
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
Yeah it's bad

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Do I get to the beginning of this

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
If you're naming yourself after I mean girls character

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,759
Something that said in Mean Girls and you're a trump supporter

84
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
I need to reconsider the messages that movies are trying to

85
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
To get through

86
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
Holocaust denial ISM of reviewing me

87
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
That's what that is that's rewriting the Civil War to make Mean Girls it was actually about female empowerment

88
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
That's what I understand

89
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Lincoln how to diet

90
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
About Monday the

91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
It's worth a damn

92
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Are worth us talking about

93
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
So this would be Monday the 9th

94
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
July

95
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
And I just have two clips that I'm going to play from this

96
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,695
Because these are f****** like these are really scary

97
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
Who's the guy who I guess he has on a lot

98
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
Before

99
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,471
To be on to talk about the volcanoes in Hawaii

100
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,287
Explode volcanologist

101
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Cuz everytime I look

102
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
How to talk to a real

103
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
This guy seems more like a Christian Fundamentalist

104
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,159
That really it's a tough combo combo

105
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,047
Fuel open and then Hawaii family pray for Trump

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,119
Twice-a-day and stuff

107
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,007
No I believe this guy is a grade-a number-one

108
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Piece of s***

109
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Destiny the Juan de Fuca plate

110
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,919
And it is like 55 years now overdue

111
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
49-point plus earthquake

112
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
Creating highways and a lot of damage of the shore

113
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,903
So yes it is overdue

114
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
I got to tell you California

115
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
Got to devote I wouldn't mind losing their their political votes at the moment

116
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
Surviving if it won't be able to

117
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
I was just saying my disappeared

118
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
Believe in the plot of escape from l.a. right now

119
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
Is California breaks off

120
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,727
We will have a fundamentalist Christian lunatic running I mean he doesn't

121
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
Believe it but a collection of them running the f****** country turn it into a f****** nightmare

122
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:17,247
You clearly I'm going to have to remove your eyes cuz your skin all over them

123
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
You've got this covered

124
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,207
Across and

125
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Take your pick

126
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
I would say

127
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
The pile of s***

128
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
For wishing a 9-point earthquake to hit

129
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
California in order to

130
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
Get them to stop voting

131
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Isn't it funny

132
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,087
Isn't Larry the most our enemy of the one that

133
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Right now

134
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Minority

135
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
He's there

136
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
Nice Melting Pot going on

137
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,607
But like the things that I really want to drive home this is the most important thing is

138
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
Is it this is on the same

139
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Constantly talks about

140
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
How shity it is but Rob Reiner wants to punch Trump

141
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,175
Or something like that creating these images of violence

142
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Against their enemies

143
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
He's having a guy on who says he wants a 9-point earthquake to hit California because they didn't like how they vote

144
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Scale version

145
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
Robert De Niro

146
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Which is what you is responsible to

147
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
To do in this situation

148
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,263
He wants any intellectual credibility

149
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,567
But you know only his political enemies

150
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
The

151
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
The Nook the level of death

152
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
That would happen if earthquake hit

153
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
California

154
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
In the billions

155
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
Five figures probably I would say probably in the five figures

156
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Another reason he is not a real volcanologist

157
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
People do not use the Richter scale

158
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Actual

159
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
I don't know if I can help you with that

160
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
9.5 is the highest

161
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Been rated

162
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
Ears ears

163
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Advocate violence

164
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
I do but it's targeted at people

165
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Who are causing the problem

166
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Are you in the same way in the same way over

167
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Them it's just everybody

168
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
You get rid of California is liberal

169
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
The whole country

170
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Think so

171
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
Inhumanity out of it

172
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
I think we would at least

173
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
Call call like delay the vote

174
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07,231
If we were still trying to repair cats it's not like California would be left on its own to fix it.

175
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Tire country

176
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
Would also

177
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Waterport, California is what the largest economy in the world

178
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
I remember the number the number to the California

179
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
You don't get to eat

180
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
So go f*** yourself out there

181
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Just gone

182
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
And found the garden

183
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Which Alex is going to have him

184
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
Biblical literalism

185
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,663
Garden of Eden f****** roll the dice on that

186
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
A very large

187
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Scale project that I can

188
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
I can't really get into all this

189
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
Tails up

190
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Research on some of the individuals involved

191
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Alex Jones

192
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
His world and I just recently did a deep dive on Doctor group

193
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
No

194
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
But he is a member of a group called these

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
Society for scientific exploration

196
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
Which I don't like them using the word scientific

197
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,359
It's not

198
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Pictures of fake

199
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,271
You can't have scientific anywhere near your name

200
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,343
Doctor is no doubt

201
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Can I bring this up

202
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
That they put out

203
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
The scientific

204
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
Society

205
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Found their archive

206
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
And I've read a bunch of them

207
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Scholarly written articles

208
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
Frazee leaps of logic work in undergraduate

209
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
With the form of an abstract up top

210
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Format down

211
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
Hold on what the f*** are you talking about

212
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
Kinesis really fun to read a review paper about the magic and a hairy

213
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,239
Potter Universe being real absolutely

214
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
The five different

215
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Poets works

216
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
To discern the identity

217
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Of William Shake

218
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,735
I thought you could use them to enhance your sword in The Witcher

219
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
That is 1/4, all right

220
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
So the reason I bring this up is it's another

221
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Parallel

222
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,719
Between swery Kerry Project Camelot

223
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
You know who's one of the associate editors of the Society of scientific exploration

224
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
Extraordinaire

225
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,311
Absolutely

226
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
I don't know I think they are

227
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
I found out it was at the

228
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,135
The farsight Institute Courtney Brown run not-for-profit

229
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Music slightly different for the Incorporated

230
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:27,935
Just funnels a bunch of stuff to the for-profit and non-profit

231
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Businesses like

232
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,591
No big deal

233
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Prophet

234
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
You can do that for when your whole thing is about like

235
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
I'm going to trick people into thinking I was

236
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
In Hitler's mind and Ike

237
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,855
I can tell you what he thought

238
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
The oversight

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Is a

240
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
For-profit

241
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
Talking about oversee which is the non-for-profit

242
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
Happens all the time the same organization Courtney Brown

243
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
One of the associate editors of the

244
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
The journal

245
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Which is an interesting parallel between

246
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
And we have this damn Deo dickhole cuz on also is

247
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,159
Making a documentary or writing a book about finding the Garden of Eden

248

On Project Camelot 95 earthquake

249
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
Turn on Monday I think it's very scary Alex Jones

250
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Dan Lyman

251
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,103

255
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Ernest was in

256
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
All the time that's the one

257
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
All right you always

258
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607

259
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Limon is the European editor of

260
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Infowars

261
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751

263
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,431
We're already over there

264
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
I forgot about Steve PJ Watson

265
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
It could be him he's already in Europe is now you got the damn alignment

266
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,135
Who's the European editor

267
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,215
I don't I don't give a s*** all right because

268
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
It seems like a little bit of a crazy dude

269
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Here is Alex

270
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615

Scary s*** about Europe

275
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
Great I know why you're such a cultural

276
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Islamic invasion

277
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
And then

278
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Crossword

279
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
No

280
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Understand

281
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,031
What's happened before

282
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Hollywood movies

283
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Show that

284
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,343
Ridley Scott

285
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Turn the tide

00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:49,151
Victor Von matteosalvini the true history once they had the platform and add the support of the people

287
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551

00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
And now in Austria now have a break Everman theranos do they have their work cut out for them but

289
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
He's going to start buying all these movements together he wants to kind of be the figurehead of that it's going to create huge problem for Brussels

290
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
I think it's starting to basically fracture the entire

291
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
Political Spectrum in Europe

292
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Unfortunately agree with that last time

293
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
It is

294
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
Doing a real number

295
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
Political Unity?

296
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Nationalist country

297
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,375
You want to have a nationalism little head in

298
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Also a little bit

299
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,495
This Dan Lyman starts talking about how I even

300
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
Sweden Democrats

301
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Are starting

302
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
To make some

303
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Main road

304
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,151
I mean I just like to read you here this little piece

305
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Swedish parliamentary party

306
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Had the largest share of elected

307
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
Spell representative

308
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Resign since

309
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
420 Channel X

310
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
27 point

311
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
Many of these resignations were brought on by racist statements or actions by these representative

312
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
They November 2012 party spokesman Eric almquist

313
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Resigned after

314
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
We've been caught on tape bacon grease

315
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Austin Texas statements

316
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Another video later surfaced showing

317
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
Party spokesman

318
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
Berkeley

319
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
And Party official Christian westling

320
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,407
We're among themselves are arming themselves with aluminum pipes

321
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
Before they sought out a confrontation with Sauron Ismail

322
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
A Swedish

323
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
Comedian of Kurdish

324
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
I wonder why they didn't like him in March 2013 12 individuals were thrown out of the party for therein

325
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Neo-Nazi and other extremist movements

326
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,631
Like it's just crazy like they Democrats

327
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
That the party has its roots in

328
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Swedish fascism

329
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Evo Nazi movie

330
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
Through the early 90

331
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
So I mean like

332
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Get the sense of like what they're talkin about I mean like

333
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
In that quip

334
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
That the sort of found a vision of Western identity in the

335
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
European countries

336
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
Is the repulsion of Muslims

337
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,487
Netflix that's what gives them their cultural identity that's

338
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
F****** scary thing to think

339
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Here's what I

340
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
You think immediately upon listening to this

341
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
When you look back at the history of the United States

342
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Around

343
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
What

344
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,359
1937 through 9

345
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
1941

346
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Where is Zur

347
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
But you see people act

348
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
Actively saying like no Hitler great that bad

349
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
As a shameful part of America

350
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
I look at

351
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,631
The other countries now not invading us as a shameful part of their hair

352
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,935
Like in all honesty because

353
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
What it what else was that little rant

354
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
I'm saying

355
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
That

356
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
All of European history has been wiped

357
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
And they have been invaded

358
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Buy brown paper

359
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
You nailed it

360
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
For the first time

361
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,695
Everybody everybody

362
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
Is invading their aggressors

363
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Everybody who lives there now

364
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Because

365
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
How do you feel about the government in Austria right now Dan Italia I'll tell you how you feel

366
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
They want

367
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
All white people

368
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,223
We're fighting literal Nazi

369
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
I don't understand

370
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,903
We know what they're doing we know what they're going to do

371
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,791
We can we can bring up the end

372
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,143
Why can't we just skip to the part where everybody

373
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,287
Pretend it's not happening

374
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Skip to the end

375
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,151
We're already in a civil war let's just f****** do it let's get it over with

376
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Snap snap

377
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Yeah it sounded like Alec

378
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
We're already in the Civil War

379
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,647
We're the ones who are living in the Civil existence they're the ones who were fighting the war

380
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
And they've been winning for the past 15 years

381
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
It's pretty wild

382
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,544
Viacom anymore

383
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
It is a little insufferable that's kind of why I like the past more

384
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Do the Henry Rollins end

385
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,016
Interview

386
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
That was a wild

387
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
You know we have a responsibility is a lot going on in the world now and

388
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,744
I think we do have a responsibility to check in with a monitor

389
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
Lucy on Monday

390
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Stan deyo being wild piece

391
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
We see Dan Lyman and Alex

392
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
Commiserating celebrating the idea of fascist movement

393
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
Politically they work

394
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
Spiritually wearing hoods

395
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
So now we're going to talk about Tuesday the 10th

396
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
Of July I will talk to you about where I was like

397
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,928
It's stupid

398
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
We can hit the main topic without like

399
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,072
Turn it off like an hour and those

400
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
We're going to listen to clips and all that but like

401
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
Cut out I think I texted you about this

402
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,080
So much of it is just like we talked about this before

403
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,616
Blustery nonsense

404
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
About how great he is

405
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
And all this

406
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
All this art of Nursing

407
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Statistic weird talk

408
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,880
And so I will start the show on July 10th

409
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
You think

410
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,000
That he would start by talking about the Supreme Court

411
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,352
It seems like the obvious thing to talk to Brett Kavanaugh

412
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Being

413
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,448
Nominated for the Supreme Court

414
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:10,848
Maybe he would talk about the fact that he interrupted The Bachelorette and it really screwed up his DV

415
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
No

416
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Interruption

417
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
The last 10 minutes were cut off his recording

418
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
That's culture-war on the libs

419
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,400
He doesn't start any of that stuff

420
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Exactly in line with what is

421
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,336
Ago in the Chicago

422
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,920
Trump pictures

423
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,552
Start 2016 occupation National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon

424
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
Amazing also set to go to England

425
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,464
Hourly islamists

426
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
IPhone 4

427
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
Trump be blocked from the country

428
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
So that

429
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Is how he starts

430
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
Rich

431
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
As I said

432
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
Very in line with his principal

433
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,896
Exploded all over my table

434
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
You know everybody paper towels

435
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,016
Edit

436
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
So

437
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
The Hammond

438
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
You know what's fun

439
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,512
We always talk about how it is

440
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Terrible

441
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
2

442
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
Think of jailing your political enemies

443
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:42,752
You know like when when everybody was screaming walk around healthy as an impulse

444
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Seems like

445
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
That's

446
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Road

447
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,944
Is right for a crimes

448
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:58,880
That's that's gobbledygook and you are a dumb libtard I would like

449
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
The directions

450
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,976
Stupid

451
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
No no

452
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,304
You need to stop

453
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
You're Maui's claptrap

454
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,544
Socialism

455
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Is going to

456
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
Inform you about what the hell

457
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,456
And what the situation is

458
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:29,344
I say this was great Trump is Akira the crimes they committed

459
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,904
And then say that they shouldn't really have been crimes right

460
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,512
Controlled Burns

461
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,352
Everybody Gadget New York

462
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,656
Georgia to Florida

463
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,496
The mexico-texas Border Illinois

464
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
Real quick his trouble trouble with the law predates over

465
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
Just just just for fun

466
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
And she'll line

467
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,536
Brothers Brothers

468
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,584
As a firebreak

469
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Because the

470
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
Little bit of it

471
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,152
Beggars having a controlled burn

472
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688

Smoke in the sky sometimes

475
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
All the Mexicans

476
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
I caught

Close man

480
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:15,328
That is Big Bird

481
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,960
Amanda little bit of everybody doesn't there's a

482
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
Mexican bakery

483
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
I always side with the people

484
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:33,504
Okay there is a Uber in the

485
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
The crops and stuff like that

486
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,696
Standard

487
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,280
Stop but

488
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
How right

489
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Alex's

490
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
I'm I'm being office

491
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:55,008
We'll get to the reality of your own.

492
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Situation here in a second

493
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Hobbit first Alex husband

494
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Stupid

495
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Stupid phone

496
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,968
A small amount of

497
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Gratiot and

498
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,880
Undercover of foliage

499
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,696
Outrageous

500
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
They weren't really all that

501
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,472
To argue that a pardon of the Bundys would always have

502
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,776
Armed confrontations

503
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,736
You can't argue with this was a very important

504
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,296
These people are obviously political prisoners

505
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,648
Prison for their strongly held beliefs they were fighting

506
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,256
Entrenched power in order to represent the oppressed

507
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
And so for them to

508
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:56,192
Is just like if time in jail in Alabama

509
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
Exactly what this is

510
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
You could never convince me otherwise no matter what you say next which I assume is going to be very well-researched and

511
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
I really want to do a controlled burn they can do so it's absolutely

512
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:16,160
Need a permit Martin Luther King tires is always dangerous

513
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
Potential for widespread damage is always there

514
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
Pretty consistently

515
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:26,912
As was definitely the case in the Artie Hammond fire of 2001 way before Barack Obama was President

516
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,872
The Hammonds illegally slaughtering Wild game

517
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:43,296
So they were killing animals

518
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
My God is pretty consistently been located

519
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
F****** God they're all have been witnesses to this

520
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:53,024
Another specific hold on

521
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
It's from the government documents

522
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:02,752
August 22nd and 23rd 2005 Stephen Hammond said fires to brush and other flammable material

523
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,288
Causing fires to burn

524
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
Ion public and private land

525
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
And as a result of the fires of rocks

526
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
Smitley 1,342 Acres

As a result of the fircreek area fires

529
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
The US and kreutzer

530
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Austin resource

531
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,856
To BLM land

532
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
In the total of 188

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
8000 to $20

534
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
How many acres again

535
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,768
1300

536
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
42a

537
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
2005

538
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,704
Alright also before Barack Obama

539
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
About August 22nd 2016 Hammond Set Fire To Brush and other flammable material causing fire

540
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408

00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,480
As a result of the fire approximately 804 Acres

542
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248

Fire

546
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Do u.s. encourage suppression cost

547
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
What's the amount of $15,000

548

$400

552
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,680
This fire also almost trapped and killed for BLM fire

553
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,008
Because they were unaware of the fires that have been satinwear there

554
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,848
Trying to work on another fire

555
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,456

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
6000

565
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
496

566
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
$6

567
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,920
Murdered a man for selling us

568
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
Cigarettes

569
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Incidentally throughout all of this Steven blight

570
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Threatening to

571
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
To kill and frame BLM employees

572
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,952
Repeatedly tell them I want them I want that out of jail we can kill them

573
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
Let's burn them oh my God we have to burn them alive

574
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
No no no this is where you you come in with your

575
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Extrapolation that.

576
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,104
Is no good man you got to you got to stop threatening to kill people

577
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,248
I'm saying that you're not advocating this is a perfect

578
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Twilight Zone opportunity

579
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,136
So they commit all of these terrible crimes through the use of Art

580
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:32,256
Send a boy

581
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,792
Surprise twist

582
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Bigot

583
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Pardon

584
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
Mental invalid

585
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Right

586
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
And then they get burned alive that is

587
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Twilight Zone the guys license

588
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,224
Getting bro they finally got time now to make more controlled Burns

589
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
And one of them gets burned alive and then the other one

590
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,160
Have to watch it and then we

591
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,952
Is icing I mean whatever you're saying

592
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376
Has the TV show I don't like in real life

593
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,936
I would say the TV version be a little bit boring

594
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm more interested in the fact that what

595
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
But this park

596
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Does

597
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,968
Just specifically indicate that like

598
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,088
There's no other real message behind

599
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Story of

600
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Of arson

601
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Stop the ship for

602
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
20 fukkit

603
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
Here is even more than

604
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Perhaps

605
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
I get that their history goes so far back in terms

606
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
So just not

607
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
Not playing by the rules

608
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Burning

609
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,960
To cover up crimes and stuff like that

610
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
I get it you don't understand your argument like Alex's argument hinges most

611
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Leon like

612
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
Do a sovereign citizen freeman-on-the-land beliefs there

613
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Anything Goes

614
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
I'm sorry that

615
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
If it was even make the argument that the problem is illegal for

616
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
For them to hunt

617
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:16,960
In that situation cuz if it wasn't illegal they wouldn't have let those fires that opens up too much of a can of worms

618
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
She can't admit that even the first

619
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Stefan struve

620
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:25,152
Cuz that it truly becomes a conversation

621
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
The primary

622
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
Ignore the primary issue

623
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Focus on the 2nd

624
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
You know it's fast

625
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
What interest me about this

626
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
And what

627
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
More Insidious

628
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,768
This is a life

629
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,864
America has a long history of corrupt president pardoning people

630
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
4

631
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Political race

632
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,080
Regardless a Democrat

633
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,688
The the thing that isn't serious about this

634
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Petty

635
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
How small

636
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
This is just random

637
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Small

638
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
Dumbshit

639
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
To signal

640
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
Hey guys it's all good

641
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:14,816
It's all good cuz I'm going to ignore you for that fits within my power I'll probably

642
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:21,216
And we got

643
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,104
Conservation

644
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Of like

645
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Sacred site

646
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
Father were desecrated and things like that

647
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Respond out of the Bundys

648
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
Stand up for

649
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,304
The the Hammonds with Hammonton already cut a deal

650
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Like they already

651
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Plead down

652
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
Yeah all their arson

653
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
To get like five years with time served or whatever like it's not yet

654
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Not even a big

655
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Quite frankly

656
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
And they're cool man

657
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,320
That's the worst part about it

658
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,928
It's now it's not even their second straight or their 45th strike

659
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,280
Number one crime again

660
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Indiana

661
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Another 48

662
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
In 2006

663
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
The Grandad fire like

664
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
Cost of it was over $1000000

665
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
In terms of

666
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Do like me

667
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
Suppression cost

668
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
And I'm sure they had to pay that back

669
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
No I don't think so

670
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
Well what about the fireman they almost murdered

671
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,352
Because that's really what it is today was it was arson

672
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,936
Commuter all the sentences

673
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:02,848
If you want to take away V like a malicious really f***** up Sovereign citizen

674
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Believes that are being emboldened

675
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Through the sort of thing

676
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
I mean you just got to deal with like the

677
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Hundreds and

678
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Thousands of dollars of damage they've caused by setting

679
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
Fires over and over again

680
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,464
When they want to cover stuff up or it's more convenient to them

681
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
And I don't believe in getting

682
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
So like the fact that

683
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
They just

684
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
Are this capricious and it ends up

685
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Comes from

686
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,824
The comes from the Bureau of Land

687
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
Management resource

688
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Comes out

689
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,248
It's money really concerned about where my tax dollars go

690
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
These two dudes

691
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,648
I'm specifically caused over $1000000 or way more

692
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
How damaged

693
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
We are paying for

694
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
I cannot allow my tax dollars

695
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,352
To go to something like Planned Parenthood promotes

696
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
And and

697
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Funds abortion

698
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,984
Help people even when they don't even need them

699
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,872
But I want your hat

700
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,152

702
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
To go

703
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
The cover-up

704
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
No anything

755
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,848
But the funniest part was that he was asked.

756
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
If you was using a voice

757
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Altering

758
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
Thing on the phone

759
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:28,576
What does it matter if I should I

760
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,976
That would have been really wouldn't like

761
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Lake Manawa

762
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,400
I wonder if it was like trying to get some extra work on the side

763
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
Conspiracy juboraj

764
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
I'm sure

765
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:51,360
Do you need an expert

766
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,943
Call

767
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
We got to start that

768
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Goddamnit program

769
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,415
Study different thing

770
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:09,791
Timer 48 minutes into this episode and heard anything about

771
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,095
Supreme Court but here we go

772
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Finally gets

773
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Alex

774
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Alright

775
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,991
And Trump knows other people

776
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,319
He is

777
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,183
For whom his son belching

778
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
Problematic

779
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,751
To try to block him

780
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
Trump is under investigation

781
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:08,159
By that extension he couldn't have the last guy either

782
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
Bingo

783
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Nailed it

784
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:26,591
About what you were saying there over the clip I don't know how much of that is like I don't I don't know if I buy into

785
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
Too much to a lot of

786
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
That's dumb

787
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
Seems like

788
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
There could be some

789
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:42,463
Smoky or something like that but I'm not ready to jump on board and say that there were like

790
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
Backroom negotiations

791
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,631
And stuff like that understand that there is a connection in in terms of

792
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:55,263
Anthony Kennedy son worked at the bank where Trump owes a lot of money personally loaned him

793
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,919
Look up

794
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,759
Is true path around the Sun part

795
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
Right that isn't evidence

796
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
Necessarily

797
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
This being a screwjob

798
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,231
Jump too far into that I think that what you're doing is

799
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:21,631
Conspiracy theory as if that was the only thing if it was just like well his son

800
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,239
Was part of the bank that loaded all that money

801
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
Approval

802
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,615
His

803
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
However

804
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,223
This is something that people have kind of

805
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,503
Known about for a while

806
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
Like the two of them have been in contact pretty

807
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
There is a very suspicious

808
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,183
Circumstance retires

809
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:50,303
Exactly when he retired and election Network

810
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,935
This is this is the circumstantial evidence at this point outweighs my my steps

811
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,983
And even if it's even if

812
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
It's not true

813
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,175
Like it doesn't it doesn't f****** matter because someone

814
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
I have business deals with

815
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
That doesn't mean I can

816
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,295
Get my dad

817
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,647
You know what I mean like it is a completely separate person from me

818
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
The same thing

819
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
Kennedy and his dad right

820
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,839
Like I don't understand

821
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
There's a lot of stuff that smells bad

822
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
There's a lot of stuff

823
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
A lot of stuff button

824
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
The details of it I believe need to be more concrete

825
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,895
Then they are now in order for me to be to compel by I would have loved this

826
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:43,295
2 years ago this sort of thing would have been like oh hell yeah

827
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
Disparate details can be made

828
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
To seem like

829
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Explanations of

830
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Much larger puzzle

831
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
And I don't

832
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
I don't feel comfortable with that in

833
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Until

834
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:05,823
What watching this episode of to be like

835
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:13,247
True but I don't want to spend

836
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
My pressure

837
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,063
Precious life debunking

838
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
Right-wing meme

839
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,159
Or something like that

840
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,207
Before even Kavanaugh was announced

841
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
The libs

842
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
The joblib

843
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,095
They printed out signs with all the possible names with

844
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Well yeah because Mike Federal

845
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,543
Federalist Society gave us a list of names that we need to stop

846
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,823
I don't want to spend

847
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
Of my life diving into

848
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,991
There's so much to be like

849
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
We can

850
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Weekend

851
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,575
You can talk about this a lot more

852
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Competently

853
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
In the future

854
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,671
In the present all we can really say I

855
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
Responsibly

856
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
This looks bad

857
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,375
I'm trusting that reporters will follow the threads

858
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,703
That we can't

859
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:10,079
And I'm I'm totally on board with that I don't I'm not going to say it is true

860
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:15,455
I'm not here is why I'm having fun

861
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,991
Very self-conscious

862
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
About other

863
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
People

864
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,623
Did the show going off half-cocked believing

865
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
Here's why I'm having fun

866
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:25,951
Because

867
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
It doesn't matter either way

868
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
It doesn't f****** matter

869
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,607
Of course it regardless regardless if it's corrupt

870
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
It's corrupted

871
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,263
Everybody there's no there's no decision now

872
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,567
Coming out of this government that is not

873
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Inherently

874
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
Teams with corruption

875
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
Regardless of whether or not it happened in this

876
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Specific circumstances

877
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,759
Specific way

878
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:53,599
If you do start digging into it you're going to find out something else is

879
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
Incorrupt

880
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
Ironically

881
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
I really hope the people under

882
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Stanley you're being

883
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Slightly

884
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
Satirical

885
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,895
You know what you're right I'm not advocating violence

886
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:22,783
I really am not that's not the way to go I hate that I keep pushing you on it but it's just like

887
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
I mean like

888
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
I think if there's a lot of people who

889
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Are like a Bill Maher

890
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
And then the last

891
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Get accused of

892
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
Meyers BBQ

893
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,191
We could be

894
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,055
He was.

895
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,151
I did let me tell you something then

896
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
This is all about

897
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,783
Burned is like

898
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
Not maybe not a crime but it's on the

899
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
It's on the border of Lake

900
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Maybe

901
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
He should be though

902
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:06,303
Like by any reasonable metric just like from a purely scientific standpoint

903
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,191
Of the people who are murdered that's not a possible consequence

904
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
All of the people who are murdered by the state

905
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Right

906
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
Imagine

907
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,991
Are any of their crimes

908
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
Ever equal to

909
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
What is Scott Pruitt

910
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:34,463
Made so many decisions going to result in the deaths of hundreds of people

911
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
Maybe not maybe not he's going to

912
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,119
Exacerbate climate change to the point

913
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,655
Vermillion people died or whatever

914
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
Do have concrete

915
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
Numbers behind

916
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,871
Something like

917
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:58,527
This person alive

918
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:04,927
Ugly language could be accused of like right reactionary ISM or something like that

919
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
And maybe I'm being like

920
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,255
I know that hey this is

921
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Play in the middle

922
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
Or whatever in correctly.

923
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
You know

924
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Here's the best way I can describe

925
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
The way that I treat

926
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
My tendency towards advocating violence

927
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
If if

928
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,271
If that is what it can be called

929
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
In a court of law

930
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,415
But

931
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,719
Torture I think it is absolutely torture

932
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
For anybody to be held

933
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Whitten solitary can

934
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
Yep Paul manafort was held in solitary confinement

935
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,727
23 hours out of every day

936
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Still torture

937
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
Treehouse in solitary confinement for that long still torture

938
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
X logistical

939
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Situations like I would never

940
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
Will be done is a putative thing

941
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
But

942
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
You know if you are a white supremacist

943
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,671
Can you get put into a prison where you're going to get killed

944
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:14,559
I think it's for your own safety might be the only option or cordoned off wings

945
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,887
White supremacist

946
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:21,727
Most prisons already get rid of prison

947
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:25,311
If you're going to attend I don't think it is right

948
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
For Paul manafort

949
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,383
To have to be

950
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
In that solitary

951
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
Multiple times culture is

952
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
However

953
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
However

954
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
I do think

955
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,575
It is an appropriate

956
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,159
Punishment based on the punishments that we've existed in the past

957
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
Sure like for his crimes fan I deserve

958
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
The punishment that we Dole out

959
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
For crimes that are far less damage

960
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
That's it that's all I'm saying

961
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,007
It's a it's a it's a it's like a mask

962
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
Like if you got if you got

963
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,407
One column of all the people who died because of your decision

964
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,991
And the punishment that you received in the other column

965
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
Most serial killers

966
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Killed less people personally

967
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,903
Vans

968
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
And they are they are killed

969
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,255
Now my only argument against that I suppose

970
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:24,191
For how many months

971
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
You don't like I know that you're not out of

972
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,287
But I really don't like the idea of

973
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,335
Punishment

974
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,639
Justice system being involved in like

975
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Biking

976
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:38,271
Hammurabi SS eye-for-an-eye like you deserves

977
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,343
Totally stupid

978
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,487
Is too much relishing the pain that you can cause someone who has caused other people paying I don't feel like that's a

979
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
A good thing for humans

980
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
Much more

981
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
I think we should

982
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
I think we should do that sounds like I was actually looking into

983
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,663
I was actually looking into this specifically because

984
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
I'm going through all the crimes that have been committed by

985
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,551
The people in bed

986
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
Inexplicably giving power to

987
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
And I'm trying to figure out

988
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,463
Could you actually prosecute them for the

989
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
And so much of it is actually legal

990
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,839
So then I was like well how if I were going to be elected

991
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
Or or something along those

992
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,471
How would I circumvent the fact that what they did was

993
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,007
Was not illegal here

994
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
But should be

995
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,639
And is other places we'll lure them to a foreign country

996
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,991
Looking up International Court of looking up all of this

997
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,807
How do we do the new Nuremberg trials like that kind

998
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
I'm stopping there really isn't any recourse

999
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,903
Well the Nuremberg trials

1000
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,511
Post facto

1001
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
Get punished

1002
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,143
Against our laws

1003
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:58,911
Should have like

1004
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Nazis

1005
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,775
It should be written into every one of our laws

1006
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
Vine with Kavanaugh

1007
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,343
OK Google

1008
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
Also he makes no

1009
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
Point of being like

1010
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:26,303
Now I know that I said I had real deep sources that said that

1011
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,863
Nominate

1012
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,679
Start that last week by saying I'm usually right

1013
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
But the rest of it he never brings up

1014
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
But like

1015
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,847
I was I was wrong

1016
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:45,247
You're probably pretend you never said that you ever seen Kevin on napoletana in the same room

1017
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,807
Reasons why Alex

1018
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
Shouldn't be

1019
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,135
Should I guess

1020
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
Here is a

1021
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
Deferring to Presidential Power in

1022
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
High-profile case

1023
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,679
For instance after the Supreme Court ruled that enemy combatants

1024
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,471
Detained in Guantanamo Bay have the right to

1025
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,495
To challenge their detention

1026
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
Camden Court

1027
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Cerbat of judges on

1028
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,639
The circuit who subsequently ruled in ways that critics have said actively

1029
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Converted the high courts

1030
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,223
Decision you can go after render it

1031
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
Original

1032
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
From a report on

1033
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
MPR

1034
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
Care about president

1035
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Should not be in favor I don't know absolutely

1036
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
And it's not caring about pressing it at all this guy was super into like these people's Warehouse

1037
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,055
Tortured in all this

1038
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Absolutely

1039
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,223
And should be for Mr that

1040
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,247
Anti-contraception

1041
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
Environmental regulations

1042
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Croagunk

1043
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,671
The South Carolina law that required

1044
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Which of course is a corner

1045
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Arizona voter to

1046
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
Can we just call him

1047
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,375
Death like everything you just described everything he's anti

1048
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
And everything is Pro

1049
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,471
Lead to people dying who don't

1050
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Who shouldn't

1051
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,359
Who have no reason to die other than because of those positions

1052
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015
I think you might be dramatizing it and that neutrality a tiny bit but the other ones you

1053
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
You're right on that

1054
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:30,463
I agree with the rest of them kind of life and death

1055
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,303
Slight right right

1056
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,167
It does limit people's ability to organize

1057
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Congregate

1058
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,983
I wish I could lead to

1059
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
The death

1060
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,871
I know you probably

1061
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
And I'm passing

1062
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
There's only one way to

1063
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,063
Shutting the

1064
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
I mean at this point

1065
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
The thing that

1066
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
Is anything that

1067
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Look at

1068
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
Now with

1069
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
Like a knowledge of History

1070
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Combines with like

1071
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
Where we're going

1072
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
People keep talking about how

1073
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
He's going to

1074
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Swing the

1075
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
The court conservative

1076
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
Next 30 or 40

1077
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,263
Right

1078
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
If he is approved

1079
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,127
Max

1080
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,431
Before either the world ends

1081
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Or

1082
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
There's a violent overthrow

1083
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,087
Biggest

1084
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,367
Indications that

1085
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
I've been stopped myself before I get

1086
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Gloomy about this but

1087
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
You know we have

1088
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,583
Reordering of

1089
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
National priority

1090
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,775
Making friends with him

1091
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,079
Pretending the Kim Jong moon is on the level

1092
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,615
When he's clearly not

1093
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:55,711
Please cook their reports coming out all over the place that they are still doing massive test

1094
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:01,599
Hilariously not hilariously the Optics

1095
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Doing stuff like that

1096
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
I'm partying up to Great extent with

1097
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Putin

1098
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Other authoritarian

1099
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:11,327
And leaders around the world

1100
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
Things like that

1101
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,263
Things and we are not

1102
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:25,919
Do you want to be on the road

1103
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
15 years old

1104
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,623
But like cuz there is beer there is

1105
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,903
A world

1106
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
Also see

1107
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
As being popped

1108
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:41,279
We're really bad decisions get made

1109
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Cooler heads

1110
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Prevail

1111
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
And we are able to fix

1112
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,495
Before things go too far

1113
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,055
Going on has happened in America in the

1114
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
The problem

1115
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
With comparing those two is that

1116
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Mistakes

1117
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,199
How much lower

1118
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
Unpack lower in the past

1119
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,039
You were just f****** with

1120
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
People in America

1121
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
Now you're f****** with the world

1122
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,439
Technological advancement

1123
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,511
You have weapons advancement

1124
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
The ability to like

1125
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,911
Before the Advent of the internet or the ubiquity of the internet and

1126
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,983
The prevalence of social media

1127
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:22,751
Much harder to

1128
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:29,663
People like Alex are able to trick people

1129
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Just because we talked about it

1130
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,551
Malicious influence

1131
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
Butt video

1132
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,671
The steaks that are so much higher are on one

1133
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Is it like

1134
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,743
Outright destruction

1135
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,559
Is right around the corner

1136
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,375
A couple of bad decisions lead to like

1137
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
Our weakest nuclear bomb now is twice's as like a thousand times as strong

1138
00:59:57,055 --> 01:00:01,663
That big boy and send Manuel like that whole thing but I think even more devastating is

1139
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
Is that like

1140
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,223
Now people are so in

1141
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Entrenched in their own opinion

1142
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,807
And maybe we're guilty

1143
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
Same time I'm willing

1144
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,975
Clearly

1145
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
Fairfax

1146
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:20,351
I think one of the nice things about being a conservative

1147
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:26,239
Like they just choose whatever I want to be mad out front

1148
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,311
Anything like a videos

1149
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,359
To one of them they're not even people

1150
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
Dear Abby

1151
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,711
No they are people but

1152
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
Functionally they're not like

1153
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
I do think the

1154
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,319
This is

1155
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
I'm coming out of his

1156
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,767
Beautiful

1157
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
About like

1158
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
Value of people in

1159
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
So you shouldn't

1160
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
Like right people often

1161
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
I'm ready to write off

1162
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,751
Oh yeah a lot of people

1163
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:01,311
It's not like it doesn't it doesn't matter anymore

1164
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
Wrigley I'm ready

1165
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
I know

1166
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
15%

1167
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
Population in America if it's just like

1168
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
You guys just got a

1169
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,903
Yourself you're hurting yourself

1170
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,207
And hurting others more

1171
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,767
Book the people who support Trump were like

1172
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
Everything he's doing is great restarting this specifically going to

1173
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,751
Them look like personally

1174
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,543
Personal skin in the game

1175
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,895
And they're not even really going to

1176
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
It's bananas

1177
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:46,623
Yeah because

1178
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
Of that

1179
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Ubiquity of

1180
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,279
The internet and social media less

1181
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:58,655
Create things that look real one right

1182
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:03,263
What's the technology where you know you have these videos now or you can make it look like someone saying

1183
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
Like I could like

1184
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,783
I mean I know this is also me being Duma gloomy like that could cause a war

1185
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,903
You could very easily make a video of something like

1186
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
Kim Jeong Hoon

1187
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,999
Declaring war on America

1188
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
I mean all the time card trick

1189
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,679
Trump with that so easily f****** Stuttering John tricky with a prank call

1190
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,495
Air Force 1

1191
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
Lake Windward vision pre-internet

1192
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,615
There was a f******

1193
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:45,247
Cats that almost went wrong cause the end of the human race

1194
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Because some dude the only reason we're all still alive. Literally the only reason all of the human race

1195
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,207
Jason still alive is because one dude was like

1196
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,767
Don't think we need to press this button

1197
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
And send all these new

1198
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,095
Russian

1199
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,887
Imagine

1200
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,423
Dumbass president

1201
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
Get the video

1202
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,007
Plays and then

1203
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,311
10 minutes later they issue a retraction

1204
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
But it's too late he's already f****** dumb Chiron is is this real

1205
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Exactly

1206
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:21,599
Still doesn't matter

1207
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
To say

1208
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
We need to start a war

1209
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
He's going to do it

1210
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,767
Hopefully not

1211
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,935
Powers to the president episode

1212
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:42,079
Alex talks about why he supports Trump

1213
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
Is this

1214
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
That's not good

1215
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:18,431
To Amir couple months ago when Trump was shoving Isis up his dirty ass hoe

1216
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,783
A few years ago when his gut said that he was a gangster

1217
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,415
You had it from good already

1218
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,695
Frontman for the

1219
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
The Consortium

1220
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
I don't even

1221
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
I'd like

1222
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,983
I don't know I just had to sort of brace myself a tiny bit

1223
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,311
Are what you're about to board with this guy

1224
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
Like that's the real face

1225
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,527
Thousand

1226
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
But at least there's some like

1227
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,367
There's entry there

1228
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:03,999
There's something that's like what are you what game are you playing exactly

1229
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
A lot of options

1230
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,559
Right right

1231
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:12,959
There's that there's Dynamics there's a push and pull like

1232
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,263
I know exactly what you're doing

1233
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
This is

1234
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,079
Boring you're adorable

1235
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
Character in a bad movie

1236
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,431
When the movie of 27

1237
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
1726

1238
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,783
16 comes out eventually

1239
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,135
He was a bad character in that show though

1240
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,863
Really bad.

1241
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
Yeah

1242
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,703
Is very serious

1243
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,799
Plug it a lot very weird

1244
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,151
More people more people realize that

1245
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:59,551
What about Alex Jones

1246
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Everywhere

1247
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
Any publicity is good publicity

1248
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
That version of him is

1249
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,767
Even more interesting than now

1250
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,303
Yeah

1251
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:18,239
The only thing that interests me about this episode was like I learned a little bit more about how bad the Bundys

1252
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:23,871
Alex tampio sucks

1253
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:28,223
Bring up Andrew Napolitano anymore

1254
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:35,903
That's a great way of putting experience listening to Alex Jones now

1255
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,951
Anytime we listen to him in the Press

1256
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
All of it

1257
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,999
All that happens

1258
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
We realize that the

1259
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:41,791
The basement

1260
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Just got low

1261
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,863
There's no

1262
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,215
Bottom how much could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck chuck

1263
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Idaho

1264
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,055
You know I mean it's just it's

1265
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
Sort of a like

1266
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:01,247
How many different ways can you suck Trump's dick

1267
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,807
Like how many different ways are there

1268
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,599
Eminem Eminem

1269
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,415
Guess that would help

1270
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
Maybe try a breath mint

1271
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:17,887
Oh you could use one of those one of those strips one of those things that you put on there maybe put some LSD on there everybody

1272
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
Contact high

1273
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:19,935
Now I'm just

1274
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
Now I'm just

1275
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:28,639
Weird thing about a job

1276
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
Most of my problems come from me

1277
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,343
I don't like your characterization

1278
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,879
Because I don't think they're like

1279
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:45,279
I know

1280
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
I would frame it differently is just like how much

1281
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Lowercase

1282
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,935
Can someone bring themselves

1283
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,495
In service of

1284
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
Something

1285
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
Doesn't really

1286
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
It's not

1287
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,039
I want to say that it's not really what they're about what they're about as white supremacy

1288
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
It did

1289
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
Look how contorted does someone have to

1290
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
To get in order to rationalize.

1291
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,255
In a way that's not

1292
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
You don't like

1293
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
If he was interested

1294
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,727
To me what

1295
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Here is like a bad

1296
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Like

1297
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,639
You cuz it cuz here's what's going on

1298
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
To the people Hughes

1299
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Talking to

1300
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,479
They've already been sold

1301
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,295
To the people that he's not talking

1302
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,063
2

1303
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
He's over selling

1304
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,903
Every word he says just pushes them further

1305
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
So why are you still trying to sell

1306
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,047
Are you still trying to sell it in new and different

1307
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,447
You're selling a vacuum

1308
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,287
Or I have thrown a vacuum out the door why are you bothering with this

1309
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
Go somewhere else

1310
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
Well it's B

1311
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Because

1312
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,663
We've already talked

1313
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:14,111
Keep the Illusion for the 20% that he's still marketing to the hundred

1314
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Yeah

1315
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,439
To keep doing that or else they would realize like

1316
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
There's no

1317
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,839
Where is a group of people who are providing a liar

1318
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Otherwise

1319
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:30,495
The game kind of gets blown up

1320
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,287
Like how would you both

1321
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:37,407
Senior conservative everything Trump does is the best thing to Dule

1322
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,711
Right while still being interested

1323
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
Because he's not doing the ladder

1324
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:46,623
I would say that the way Alex could do it

1325
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Is

1326
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,999
Like ignore a lot of the news

1327
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,119
He's not good at this anyway

1328
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:00,959
And most of the time when he covers the news it's just

1329
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:07,359
Reading headline and then maybe angrily ranting about something

1330
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:12,223
I would say read the headline mostly the function of what you're doing anyway

1331
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,783
What made you interested

1332
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
Chimera stuff

1333
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:22,719
Right like go back to The Well of like your old personality that people kind of enjoy

1334
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,767
I'm in see what you can build off that

1335
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,839
Yeah I can find other avenues that are like

1336
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
That they're weird

1337
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,959
And have just enough truth that you can yell about them

1338
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
But are also

1339
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,799
Complete

1340
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,383
He's not weird any

1341
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,175
No mainstream

1342
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,759
Very mainstream now

1343
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,551
But here's the problem was that

1344
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
The problem with it is

1345
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,367
That he was

1346
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
Super successful

1347
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,463
Inasmuch as

1348
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,255
Sean Hannity is now him

1349
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
Fox & Friends

1350
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:04,447
Very closely mirrors him the lazy like before coffee

1351
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,775
Version of Alex know I hated those sorts event

1352
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Anything on Fox News

1353
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
Before

1354
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
Very shity

1355
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
Not full of garbage

1356
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
But they were not

1357
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:20,319
Couple years ago out-and-out white supremacist they were hiding

1358
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:25,439
And you know I don't even think Tucker Carlson was that much of a white supremacist before

1359
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Full

1360
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
Native some point

1361
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
Probably

1362
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,215
Hey we're going to edit out the part where you said the n-word 42 times in a row because

1363
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
If it one that's Jackie Robinson's number

1364
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
And two we can't behave

1365
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,895
Have no notice you're wearing a bow tie in adults so it'll be fine

1366
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,943
Don't be staring at that like

1367
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Expecting it to squirt on your desk

1368
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Fitbit

1369
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
The thing is

1370
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Yeah

1371
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,647
Who knows what lies in the hearts of men

1372
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
As they say

1373
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:02,815
You know like who knows if that was what those people like Bill O'Reilly or any of them was about there

1374
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,655
Fox News

1375
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
State television

1376
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,959
Asian for Bush

1377
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:13,311
Yeah I'll be like even as that was not nearly as crazy

1378
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,591
Is Infowars

1379
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,127
And now it kind of is

1380
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Alex

1381
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Because

1382
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,271
Now that they're both on the same

1383
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,295
Page

1384
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:29,183
Even though they were on the same page as being against Obama

1385
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:35,583
Weird he was screaming about like Frank Marshall Davis being

1386
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
To reclaim the weird

1387
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:43,007
Ireland has gotten too weird

1388
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,567
And now he doesn't know how to weld

1389
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
The quote Hunter S Thompson

1390
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,639
When the going gets weird

1391
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
The weird turn

1392
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,431
Pro

1393
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,087
Before or less

1394
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Yeah

1395
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:03,487
Yeah he's actually even pulled back from the weird

1396
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,023
Something that was

1397
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:10,911
Really out there

1398
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,519
Does this might actually be the best way to

1399
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
To kill Alex Jones

1400
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
Of his life career

1401
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,639
Stuff like that

1402
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:25,247
Productive

1403
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
If I were Alec

1404
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Text Network Raven

1405
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
Con man

1406
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
I think that that is what I

1407
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
That would be what prompt

1408
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Me to leave

1409
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
The team is Malik

1410
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,279
I can no longer be as

1411
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
Crazy as I need to be

1412
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,351
That's why you

1413
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,823
You trying to juice it up somehow your girlfriend of four years suddenly gets a haircut and color is your hair

1414
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,895
You're edging

1415
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,175
Around 4

1416
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:00,319
You think his beard is an indication that sound breakup

1417
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
Deep deep sad

1418
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:07,231
I really I really truly because after after I was alerted to that he had a beard

1419
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
I was allowed to look at it

1420
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,559
And it is the most disgusting thing

1421
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:15,167
I think I've ever seen in my entire life can look at that in the mirror

1422
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,727
Is a deeply depressed and unhappy

1423
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
I would say is that like I hate

1424
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,615
Latrobe on the TV shows of like when someone like

1425
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Gets a divorce

1426
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,407
Something alcoholic

1427
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,711
The girl beard Amazon

1428
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
The beginning of the

1429
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Gyros

1430
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,879
By Nathan Petrelli grow a beard

1431
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:39,487
He was a drunk he thought he was responsible for Peter's death brother

1432
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,815
You look like a sad clown

1433
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Accidentally

1434
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:49,983
Absorb the guys power there was a nuclear bomb

1435
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,519
Okay argument is annoying

1436
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,847
And in order to save the city of New York from exploding

1437
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,711
Does Peter couldn't control his powers grabbed him and threw him above the city

1438
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,039
Staffing so you grow a beard

1439
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
Drinking so much but

1440
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:10,463
She couldn't show him drinking all the time

1441
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
Anyway

1442
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
Anyway my point is that

1443
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,399
I hate it in hacking

1444
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,167
Eviction

1445
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
But I think in reality

1446
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,495
Is bi Darkrai for

1447
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Alex needs

1448
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,335
You got to shave that beard

1449
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,127
Got to shave that s***

1450
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
Oh yeah

1451
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
It's

1452
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
Definition

1453
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
It is

1454
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
First off

1455
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,623
Not block Kavanaugh because that's never going to win

1456
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
We're going to lose

1457
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
And the world is over

1458
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,463
Still hold out hope

1459
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,791
Call senators and stuff like that like spilled

1460
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:48,863
Give up even if

1461
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
The prospects aren't good if you do nothing nothing will happen if everybody in America

1462
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
Just call Susan Collins wants

1463
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,663
And says whatever it is that Mitch McConnell says to you he is lying

1464
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,711
Because he's always lied to you

1465
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
And you are gullible

1466
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:08,063
And maybe she won't vote for Kevin

1467
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
Because she's going to be told

1468
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,903
She's going to be told a million times

1469
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,463
No don't worry about it having all respect

1470
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Precedent

1471
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:21,631
And so he won't got Roe v Wade

1472
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,935
To say any challenge comes to Roe v Wade

1473
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,751
The

1474
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:31,615
Will definitely be worth it and she's going to say yes and then it's going to be gutted and

1475
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,919
She's going to be like

1476
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
Well who knows

1477
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
Anyway

1478
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,343
Let's let's move this along

1479
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,135
So

1480
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Collect Jordans

1481
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,951
Alex acts like a

1482
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,511
When you went down

1483
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
Seattle

1484
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:55,679
When I'm done with people on the street screaming

1485
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,823
He's got a slightly different take on

1486
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,687
Calling us names lying about us

1487
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,223
Havaianas

1488
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,527
Yelling screaming at us does something

1489
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,111
Yes it does something it lets me know I'm right

1490
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
About how

1491
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
Immature and stupid

1492
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,023
People are

1493
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071
I know you are but what am I

1494
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
It means nothing

1495
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,191
Doesn't it

1496
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,407
Tell me when electrolyte ideas

1497
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
Oh that's a good answer

1498
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,831
Runaway

1499
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,767
Pretty sure you just walked away when I offered the Goblin

1500
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
As we call him

1501
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
$10,000 and first

1502
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,447
Because I wanted Freeport

1503
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,311
He is an out-of-work

1504
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,615
Wannabe professional wrestler announcer

1505
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,479
Like tertiary

1506
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
The Goblin

1507
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
Where is rewriting history

1508
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Cuz I watch that video

1509
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Being a fugitive

1510
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
Everybody

1511
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119
What else idea or is that like

1512
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
Alright

1513
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,727
I didn't I didn't think that was fake necessarily

1514
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
Suspicions

1515
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
At the time

1516
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,079
But I wasn't ready to call it fake

1517
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,735
It was fake because what I hear there is Alex being like we did this scene on the streets where this guy threw something at me and I

1518
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
And it was hot coffee

1519
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
He didn't react at all like

1520
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,599
Flinching

1521
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,439
What are you saying is like I had this Tech piece that we did

1522
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,511
And then like Mike Rotondo I wanted to get him into

1523
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,583
Studio because then I could make a real show out of it

1524
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:03,679
I offered him $10,000 to do a thousand

1525
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,775
I don't really want to do it I think I'm done with our

1526
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Do not think

1527
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:12,127
I think that was good I realized even done that

1528
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,687
Yeah he walked off with his wife

1529
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:19,039
Alex is now trying to reframe it isn't saying words like I just wanted to

1530
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,087
I think I would do it

1531
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,415
I'm not going to lie to you

1532
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,023
Show up on Infowars for 20 grand

1533
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
I just sit there and stare

1534
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
Like a serial killer

1535
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Stare

1536
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:42,847
Because you know isn't that Errol Morris like sort of philosophy of documentary interviewing

1537
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,175
Let people talk

1538
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
Just what I would do I just

1539
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Oh yeah

1540
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Haha

1541
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:51,807
Oh

1542
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,623
What Alex Bill the space

1543
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
Whatever

1544
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,767
People want to talk about

1545
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Aren't you Google

1546
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
There you go

1547
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Although I

1548
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
Much like Pitbull

1549
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Mr. worldwide

1550
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,224
Befitting that 14

1551
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:26,624
Alex Azar a still talking about

1552
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Seattle

1553
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,208
He's already called him a goblin

1554
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
Right

1555
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
He always does

1556
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
It's just

1557
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
What is it about

1558
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,568
Minions of the system and make them so horrific to look at

1559
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,688
Okay I got to stop by before we come back

1560
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
Why is it always

1561
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
Why is there always

1562
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
Physical

1563
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
Why is it always

1564
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
Why I think

1565
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,280
Really going to dive into it

1566
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:08,608
I wouldn't even I actually I wouldn't even go with the

1567
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
Just White

1568
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,448
Because white supremacy is absolute

1569
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,776
But even beyond that to like

1570
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,336
The white supremacy eugenic

1571
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
That only good ideas

1572
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
Can come from beautiful looking

1573
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Genetically soup

1574
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,736
Superior people

1575
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Like his death

1576
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,552
So often

1577
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Part of it

1578
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,880
It's not just it's not just the Jewish thing

1579
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,696
Or the white thing it's always like

1580
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,096
Although he listen to what Mitch McConnell says in that guy's a f****** troll so it's mostly in a

1581
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:48,032
Completely out of my argument Trump is a f****** monster

1582
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:51,616
Chandelier everybody's

1583
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:55,200
Some stuff like that

1584
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,760
Who is he talking about

1585
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:58,784
Okay

1586
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,552
Is he Jewish

1587
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
No idea

1588
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
Specific instance isn't as important

1589
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:08,256
No I know like his tradition of people who have

1590
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,280
Semitic qualities

1591
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,376
Yeah f******

1592
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
Hiatus medical cards in order to attack

1593
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,752
Why is she always look like that

1594
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,776
All of their

1595
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,848
I'm not going to say Jewish characteristics but

1596
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:31,296
But at the same time I love my wife's nose she's got a Regal nose

1597
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:37,184
Jewish stereotype surrounded

1598
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Buckingham

1599
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Yes it does

1600
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:43,328
Coronavirus

1601
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,680
Exactly

1602
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,592
We also have the gentleman

1603
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,760
Thrown out of the electronic shop

1604
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,600
Carlson

1605
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,696
Get out of here

1606
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
He's going to be

1607
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,608
Liberal and appeared on Tucker Carlson you're alright get out

1608
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,424
All of those things don't seem to fit

1609
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,192
Together proper

1610
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,752
This

1611
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,776
Gentleman

1612
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,056
Is a guy by the name

1613
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Name

1614
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:29,920
Carefree

1615
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
People come from

1616
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,576
Video on YouTube

1617
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
I believe it is

1618
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Posted in

1619
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:44,256
You posted a video where you talkin about

1620
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Democratic Party

1621
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,144
People who

1622
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,192
Uses people of color in lgbtq

1623
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216

1625
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:57,824
I agree 100%

1626
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Movement

I do not pick up any Trash

1628
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
Until fairly recently

1629
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
A bunch of bots

1630
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
Promoting

1631
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
Analyses

1632
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
Of these account

1633
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
It really boost

1634
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,536
#walk away

1635
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
Trend

1636
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
They are

1637

There is one

1638
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,704
That's how I was very clearly

1639
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
Pointed out here in an article on

1640
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Bailey.

1641
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,056
Thousand

01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,200
I am clearly a fake

1644
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,224
Using

1645
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
Spaghetti image

1646
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,112
These are all

1647
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
All

1648
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,952
Like

1649
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,488
Reverse Google image search

1650
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,304
Search is a good idea Washington Post

1651
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,376

I'm not here to say like or anything like that

1653

But it's

1654
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
Easy over and over and over again

1655
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,152
It's less important

1656
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
I am bored

1657
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,736
Important that there are artificial forces

1658
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
Yep that there are these box Farms

1659
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344

The do that in order to buy organic

1661
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,000
No absolutely not

1662
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Midterm election

Yes video got posted what

1664
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
3 months ago

1665
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,888
And now people are bringing it up

1666
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,704
Order to

1667
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,288
So Alex has the guy on because

1668
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Stuck in Love

1669
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,688
This is this is a really unfortunate develop

1670
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,504
I really don't know

1671
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
Like it cuz here's the prop

1672
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
The Democratic party is

1673
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,624
Yes

1674
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,976
Right and so you get that old b*******

You supported Bernie Sanders in that ruin Hillary and you voted for Hillary and I

1676

You think she's s*** I don't I don't

1677
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,544
How do we successfully

1678
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,872
Destroy the Democratic party's leadership

1679
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:11,968
Without at the same time undermining our ability to

1680
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
Destroy the Republican party leader

1681
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
The plant

1682
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:18,880
Replace

1683
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,720
Improve

1684
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,024
Adjust

1685
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,584
Well Dianne Feinstein needs to be gone

1686
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:35,776
Burn their fields

1687
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:39,360
There's a lot there's a lot of

1688
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,176
Cuz what are they

1689
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,456
Install

1690
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,760
Just ineffective and not good

1691
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
Folk

1692
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,832
Rrr has

1693
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,392
Positions of power in the Democratic Party

1694
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,184
Dart not representative of what

1695
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,720
Should be easy laugh

1696
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,512
Party the main light party

1697
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,400
Elizabeth Warren

1698
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,728
Hey torpedo the entire party

1699
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
Take that

1700
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Some people do believe that

1701
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,384
I know I think there's a fine line to walk of

1702
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,712
I agree the problem is I just don't know where that line

1703
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,784
Because part of me wants to say torpedo the f****** party

1704
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,184
We have Warren we have Cortez we have

1705
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,208
So many good people

1706
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:31,584
Right like we have so many great people in Democratic party it seems like the Democratic Party

1707
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,960
Is always split between people who just want to get power

1708
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
And people who give a

1709
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,312
And the Republican party is always

1710
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,360
Unified ideologically

1711
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,176
Regardless of whether or not they're Kahneman

1712
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Nope

1713
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:49,248
You're being unfair to them

1714
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,344
There's some people who are just bad

1715
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,184
There are some people

1716
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,232
Who are real bad

1717
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,840
That's a good point there aren't that there are

1718
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:11,264
53 mom and pop bad

1719
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,944
Your sister your mom and pop store bad versus your Walmart bad

1720
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,736
With Mom and Pop dad

1721
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:23,040
And that's the game everyone thinks

1722
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
Is being played in

1723
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,648
Like the rising tide is

1724
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,184
Really bad

1725
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,208
Nascent

1726
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,120
Through its birth pains 89 years ago

1727
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,144
Coming to

1728
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:43,008
The world is whatever the people who are in power

1729
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,288
Mccratic party side

1730
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,080
Are ready to deal with that reality

1731
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:48,896
Need to go

1732
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
The same time I think

1733
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
It's probably foolish

1734
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,504
2

1735
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
All hope

1736
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,064
On

1737
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,600
Like another party

1738
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,392
And being able to create it from

1739
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,464
The ground

1740
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,744
I mean I'd love it

1741
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,536
Another party was able to

1742
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,840
To do that but I'm not sure that you are

1743
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
I hope I hope you could

1744
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,168
More effective

1745
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
In order to

1746
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,472
I think you'd be able to

1747
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:17,312
The only thing the only thing that makes

1748
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,848
To me in regards

1749
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
To actually change

1750
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
Sing the Democratic

1751
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
Party leadership

1752
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
Is to create a third

1753
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Party

1754
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,992
That is

1755
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Purely about Progressive

1756
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,552
Reviews

1757
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
That only takes on Democrats

1758
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,952
In situations where Democrats are overly overwhelmingly going

1759
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
To win anyway

1760
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:41,120
Like if Alexandria is Alexandria pull off a third-party victory

1761
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:45,472
Against the Democratic Leadership knowing full well that no matter what

1762
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,288
The progressive site is going to win that election

1763
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
All of a sudden

1764
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:51,360
Now we have a viable third-party

1765
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,640
Candidates that hasn't

1766
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,456
Split the vote and destroy the

1767
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,016
Running as a third-party person

1768
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,808
She would lose in a general election

1769
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,088
It's possible

1770
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:07,488
It's very actually know it's 100% if she was not running as a Democrat she wouldn't

1771
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
The reason

1772
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
Did run

1773
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,728
Democrats come into the party

1774
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,008
Try and push it left

1775
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,800
Yeah as opposed to

1776
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,592
Siphoning off votes

1777
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
Because

1778
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,664
Like

1779
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
Now what

1780
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,968
Create a perfect

1781
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,040
You have the middle Democrats

1782
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
Imaginary

1783
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:39,744
Jeffy middle Republicans imaginary act as well as the people on the left

1784
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,024
Making their own party

1785
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,560
People on the right

1786
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,888
Make your own Patriot party

1787
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,544
Then you would have you have off from each candidate running

1788
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
Right and you could

1789
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
See what

1790
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
Interesting

1791
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,664
Experiment

1792
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,456
With like Jill Stein

1793
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,016
And Gary pencil existing in the 20s

1794
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,040
16 election

1795
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
But I think that you could have a much better

1796
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:08,928
I think

1797
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,464
Each of those parties

1798
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,792
No

1799
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Third party

1800
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,888
Only runs super Progressive

1801
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:21,472
In areas where the Republicans are almost guaranteed

1802
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,032
So then you start asking yourself

1803
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:24,800
Is it

1804
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,872
Then you start really dealing with the strategy that

1805
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,432
Democrats have for red-state Democrats

1806
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,736
Were there like maybe

1807
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
Mostly Republican

1808
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,576
But a little bit not Republic

1809
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
Even Republicans and Democrats will vote for us

1810
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:47,840
How's this policy back by there it would be interesting as an experiment

1811
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,144
I mean

1812
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,568
Okay

1813
01:31:59,360 --> 01:31:59,872
Cymbalta

1814
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
Jordan

1815
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Chastising you a little bit maybe

1816
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,280
About

1817
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,816
How dare you

1818
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,608
Pay for the crimes that I might have

1819
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,704
But

1820
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,984
I don't like

1821
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:33,920
I just don't like any time that I feel like we're too close to Alec we're sounding like a I really don't like it end

1822
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,712
I'll play this next clip

1823
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,248
And use you if you agree with me

1824
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,064
Word for word what I say

1825
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:48,000
Physically attacking people in stores

1826
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:59,776
A lot of it. Com

1827
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
Bumper sticker

1828
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:08,992
Videos of

Smyrna

1832

Watch

1833
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:33,056
Come up with grown man

1834
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:39,712
He was saying that to himself how did I come up with that videos of

1835
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,528
Documented children screaming in ice detention

1836
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:47,392
Insiders so how do you come up with old men men beating up old women

1837
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
F*** off

1838
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Want to kill people

1839
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,304
Mineral that there is that and I think you're

1840
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
I think you're better than

1841
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,376
I think you're better than

1842
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,704
Yeah I do think you're better than to sending to the

1843
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,496
The level of that like kind of rhetoric

1844
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,032
That's all

1845
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:04,800
Well

1846
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:11,456
And this may be a very weak TR

1847
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,528
My my

1848
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,832
Difference I think there is that

1849
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,368
I am not

1850
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,904
Trying to

1851
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Like it

1852
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,208
In terms of

1853
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,232
The Vic

1854
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,280
Like I disregard

1855
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Conservative

1856
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,120
Like they are something to be

1857
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,400
There nothing

1858
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,704
Yeah I don't like none of your arguments make sense

1859
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,008
Nothing you say is anything but

1860
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,312
Destructive and you don't even know

1861
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,592
You're a pet

1862
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
You know you're the schlemiel

1863
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,456
The people who have it

1864
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
Coming though

1865
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,552
That's the difference I feel like between me and Alex Jones

1866
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,136
Faucet out to anybody

1867
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:56,000
I don't think if you disagree with me that makes you

1868
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
Evil

1869
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,584
But I know there are evil people

1870
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,912
Deserving

1871
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,704
Look I mean like

1872
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,776
Dick Cheney should be in jail

1873
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
From

1874
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:12,128
20 years ago until whenever he died

1875
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,528
Like that is not on the table

1876
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
I don't understand that

1877
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,880
I don't understand why George W is not in jail

1878
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,416
And so if I say

1879
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Okay

1880
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,024
You functional

1881
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
But but if I am saying like

1882
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,656
Those two f****** need to be burned alive

1883
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,216
The reality of what I'm saying is

1884
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:43,616
They committed serious crimes and they are not being the responsible for countless people

1885
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,408
Really burning alive

1886
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:51,808
Like that the people who have it coming and the problem with the rhetoric and I understand I understand exactly where you're

1887
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,856
Because the rhetoric makes

1888
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,904
Sound like I am saying that Alex

1889
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:01,792
They are I'm saying the same similar things that Alex is I don't want to I don't want that to be what you think I am

1890
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:06,144
Using rhetoric

1891
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,936
Has the same sound

1892
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,704
Of like

1893
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,752
These people to die

1894
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,080
But what I really am trying to say is like

1895
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,384
There is no accountability

1896
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,408
To the people

1897
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,968
Who are actually causing all of this s*** going

1898
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,248
Alex

1899
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
This is not talking about

1900
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,064
Countability Alex

1901
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
Talking about punished

1902
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:31,744
I am not talking about punishment repression about punishing

1903
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
I mean he does say lock her up

1904
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
And she'll like that

1905
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,632
He's talking about like

1906
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Protest

1907
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,448
He's talking about just people

1908
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,216
Politically

1909
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,240
Disagree with them

1910
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,544
I don't think I don't want

1911
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:46,080
Physically

1912
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,616
For Mitch McConnell

1913
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
To be murdered

1914
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,920
Right

1915
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,712
At a certain point

1916
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
Exactly how do you hold Mitch

1917
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:56,576
McConnell accountable

1918
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:58,368
So I'm fine with

1919
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
I'm fine with that

1920
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:03,232
No emotional rhetoric

1921
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Behind

1922
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,304
You need to go to court

1923
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,096
I understand that

1924
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:11,936
An emotional appeal

1925
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:17,056
It's not going to happen and there's no there's no part of me that wants to clip your emotional wings

1926
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
Does it work

1927
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:24,224
And disallow you or David you can I'm going to fly

1928
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,320
It says like hey Jordan calmed down with your language or anything like that

1929
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:30,880
I just think I think from time

1930
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,928
2 time maybe and maybe I'm

1931
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,232
Just doing this because this episode so boring

1932
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,280
Like Alex that we were talking about

1933
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:41,632
From time to time

1934
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,912
Do you like just a dressing

1935
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,960
Yeah there's a difference

1936
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,288
When you scream burn the

1937
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,056
This person

1938
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,104
There's not a actual desire

1939
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
To burn them

1940
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,456
Emotional truth behind

1941
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,504
Being set on fire

1942
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,040
Like emotional

1943
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,064
Like legitimate

1944
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,600
Emotionally

1945
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
I

1946
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Wood

1947
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,952
Not ever be able to watch

1948
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,000
Like if

1949
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:11,072
If we burn Scott Pruitt alive

1950
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:17,472
As a as a everyone would be like one of your big Villa

1951
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,776
I could never ever watch it

1952
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:23,616
It would destroy me emotionally the simple idea of

1953
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,920
Thinking about like actually seeing it

1954
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
And knowing that the

1955
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
The consequence is it

1956
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,992
Are they are real

1957
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,528
Would wreck me

1958
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
And the ideas

1959
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,856
Would have some like

1960
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,648
Part in bringing about

1961
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,440
Direct me forever

1962
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
However

1963
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
Pruitt

1964
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,584
Yeah he has personally killed

1965
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,656
With the things that he said he with the stroke of a pen

1966
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,936
People have died

1967
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,960
Because of him

1968
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,752
So how do you hold him

1969
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
Accountable

1970
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,360
You know what I'm saying that's what I really want I just want people

1971
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
Murdered

1972
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,688
At least

1973
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,224
Call Mom

1974
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:03,040
He's a murderer that part is

1975
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
Is well-taken

1976
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
He shouldn't he should not be a history

1977
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Quarantine from the recipe

1978
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Humanity because

1979
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,584
He's not allowed

1980
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,376
And I said

1981
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
Long time ago

1982
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Standby this

1983
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,728
And I have no

1984
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,568
I've no place in my heart

1985
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,104
That wishes to

1986
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,408
People who are on

1987
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,176
The last

1988
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,712
Democrats

1989
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,992
Be free

1990
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:33,760
Give this sort of

1991
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,344
The only way that I really think that

1992
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,880
Pecan

1993
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,696
Take the rock out of pallets

1994
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,720
To assert next

1995
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,744
First of all get money

1996
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,584
Like we we mediately

1997
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,376
To I don't know Public Finance

1998
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
Titanfall campaign

1999
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:56,544
The campaign season 2 like 3 months you get back to the point where there are limits on

2000
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
Campaign

2001
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,432
Contribution absolutely if any at all

2002
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
Yeah for real

2003
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
You take all that out of it

2004
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,064
The purity of the

2005
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,880
Horseback

2006
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
Subject

2007
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,976
Almost all politics

2008
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
To International

2009
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,376
Who cares if other countries do it too

2010
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
But like

2011
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:27,008
We have to we have to America is a city on The Shining Hill

2012
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,288
Then f****** beat

2013
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,824
You eat kind of

2014
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:32,640
The only way that we talk about this all the time it's like

2015
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:35,200
Like a George W bush committed war crimes

2016
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,992
Trump is committing war crimes

2017
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,528
The same time we're very

2018
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,320
Acknowledging that Obama's

2019
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,880
War crimes or has committed war crimes

2020
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
The whole thing is that like

2021
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,696
We have this

2022
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,256
Complacency in the United States is like

2023
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:50,048
In order to be president because

2024
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,584
It's so difficult and challenging

2025
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:56,192
I do so many complicated issues there's no way to do it without committing war crimes

2026
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,984
Is part of the

2027
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
Needs to go away

2028
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,104
Needs to go away the only way that's ever going to

2029
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
To happen is if

2030
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,896
Some people are held at

2031
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:08,480
Accountable hopefully all of them are held accountable

2032
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,296
Because there needs to be a war in the future if you're the

2033
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
The president

2034
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,088
Kill

2035
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,136
Thousands of civilians in a cup

2036
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,416
Country where are you

2037
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,184
You are

2038
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:19,232
You preside over that you're not the one in

2039
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:22,816
The plane or not calling the drill strike individually necessarily

2040
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:27,424
But you preside over that

2041
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,704
You are the altar

2042
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
Responsibility

2043
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
To happen

2044
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,312
I would say

2045
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,408
There is room in the conversation for rogue agent

2046
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
On the lower level

2047
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
As long as they're punished

2048
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
You know like yeah

2049
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,040
You find out who was the one

2050
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,600
Responsible for

2051
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,672
Then maybe it doesn't go all the way up to president

2052
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
Their needs

2053
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,536
To be sincere like

2054
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:57,120
Just because we say send them to

2055
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
To The Hague

2056
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,912
Sound like they're going to end

2057
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,704
The killing of maybe it's not

2058
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,728
Ready it's not

2059
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Maybe we

2060
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
Maybe we take a little breath

2061
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
And say like

2062
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,408
Listen these people committed war crimes we need to deal with it

2063
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,688
We can't

2064
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,736
Just kill them

2065
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
4X cathartic

2066
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,552
Is that would be

2067
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
But what we do is we

2068
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
You say

2069
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
Alright your estate

2070
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:22,720
He's gone yours we take away all Salgado gotten games

2071
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:26,048
Yep we take away

2072
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,376
A middle-class stature

2073
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:35,008
Which would be a delightful thing for something like me to have Excel blood

2074
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:40,384
What was the last president that doesn't belong in jail

2075
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:44,480
It's been a long time

2076
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,760
It might be all of them

2077
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,064
Eat your stand

2078
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,832
I know you are

2079
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,624
I hope people understand what I'm saying

2080
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
It's the only way that we're going to get better

2081
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,464
Deal

2082
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
With

2083
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,304
The excuses that we have for why we're not bad right

2084
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,328
And the little

2085
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,400
Things that we play a little game that we play of like

2086
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,472
Well Obama

2087
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,544
Hospital in Redding

2088
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,152
Well yeah

2089
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,944
Was probably good intent there

2090
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,968
That doesn't

2091
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:16,992
It's not okay

2092
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:23,648
All of it is not okay if your good intent is like instead of killing 1,000 people I want to kill

2093
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
Is that

2094
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,744
What good in the end like I guess

2095
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,024
I get it right

2096
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:35,936
And are on an idealistic level that's unacceptable

2097
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,960
Victor

2098
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,496
Conversation I'm trying to have

2099
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,032
Is

2100
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,824
Taking this rage

2101
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,592
That you feel

2102
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,640
About these politicians

2103
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
Deserved

2104
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
Cuz they do

2105
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,248
Across-the-board

2106
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
More Republicans

2107
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:01,024
I think we've made that clear history on fortunately I think if you look at reality

2108
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,424
Weird how conservatism leads

2109
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
Towards

2110
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,568
Good morning more to the right

2111
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,616
Weird

2112
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
But

2113
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
My point is

2114
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:23,808
Play I think we deal with this

2115
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,648
Wake up out of can

2116
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,184
Control local

2117
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
Local

2118
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,280
You know what cops way out of

2119
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,048
Control

2120
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,864
Write one of the best ways

2121
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,656
Can be dealt with his with

2122
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,680
Civilian review board

2123
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,008
You have people who are not

2124
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
Westerly politician

2125
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:48,128
Provide some oversight

2126
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:52,480
Accountable to a macro-level

2127
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,760
And you look at what

2128
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:00,160
I mean I'm willing to have another conversation about International courts not being perfect

2129
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,608
I think there are

2130
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,912
Which is not something to laugh addict

2131
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Gallows humor

2132
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,776
No I agree

2133
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:19,872
I think big picture if you look if you pulled

2134
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:23,200
Typically pull the entire world

2135
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,992
Yeah we should be crazy

2136
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,272
Yeah

2137
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,064
There's about 270

2138
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:28,832
Percent

2139
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
In terms of life

2140
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,672
What

2141
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
Buchanan

2142
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:37,024
I would I would even argue that it's so much higher than

2143
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,328
Conservative

2144
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
I think Isaac

2145
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
Going to be like

2146
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,032
5% weird this way 5% weird that way the other weird

2147
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:54,688
I'm sure 5% of us are there

2148
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,760
You can't kill people

2149
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,064
Fair enough

2150
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:02,368
Do it like there are like a lot of friend

2151
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Change groups

2152
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,184
Right

2153
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000
To do this there is

2154
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:12,352
There should be a consequence for

2155
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,912
Culturally about women driving cars and

2156
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,288
I think we've gone very too

2157
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,824
Too far on this but I

2158
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
I still think

2159
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,688
The only way home

2160
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,992
Is through accountability

2161
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,856
Require

2162
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,928
Lot of people taking some

2163
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,464
They don't want to take

2164
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:39,744
On both

2165
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,024
Exactly

2166
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,840
And we can if you want

2167
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Lock her up

2168
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,144
About Hillary

2169
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,680
In all honesty

2170
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,728
I bet you could find a reason

2171
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:56,128
Like legitimately if you just had somebody

2172
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,944
If you start looking to knit anybody who is f****** for it

2173
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,248
Tripler

2174
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,392
Not a natural thing

2175
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,928
It doesn't happen in a vacuum

2176
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:12,256
And it doesn't happen without committing some sort of atrocity

2177
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,792
At the end of the day whether it's

2178
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,584
Atrocity whether it's a

2179
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,864
Calling website

2180
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,912
Elon Musk

2181
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:25,312
Screwing his employee rights employee

2182
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,080
Level but I don't think

2183
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
He's profoundly Wellfit

2184
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,920
I think that's the trick

2185
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:35,040
I don't I know that he's very well but I like

2186
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:41,184
Blake Hyatt billionaire rich but also

2187
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,304
From from the things I've looked into about him

2188
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,352
Probably

2189
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,376
Pretty on the level

2190
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,680
But even so

2191
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:54,240
Do more

2192
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,032
I know

2193
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,360
Acceptable loss

2194
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,640
You know

2195
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
I didn't what I want to say

2196
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Yeah

2197
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,016
I survived off doing this podcast

2198
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,064
And the generous donation

2199
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,088
Good people

2200
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:09,856
Provide

2201
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,928
That's how I

2202
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,208
Survive in

2203
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,024
Is a tough tight wire

2204
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,584
Let the word

2205
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,864
Highwire

2206
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,704
Highwire.com

2207
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,728
It's a high-wire Act

2208
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Of me

2209
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,288
Constantly just about to fall off this

2210
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,848
Into the netting below

2211
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,384
Yeah and I still

2212
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,152
And I'm not saying this

2213
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:34,432
Myself sound great

2214
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,224
I still try to donate

2215
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
Causes

2216
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,040
I care about

2217
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,832
Even though I'm at

2218
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
The point where

2219
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,392
I sometimes have to go to the

2220
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,160
ReStore in a mic

2221
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,720
You know like that sort of the

2222
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,512
Sing I will try to give

2223
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,560
A little bit of money here in there

2224
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,376
Let's extrapolate that to

2225
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:57,216
Do people like Hamdi ulukaya

2226
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,496
All these billionaires

2227
01:48:59,264 --> 01:48:59,776
You could

2228
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,312
F****** live on a million

2229
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,336
And give 9

2230
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,872
900 million dollars

2231
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,920
To the advancement

2232
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,736
Artifact is morally suspect

2233
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:11,296
The concept of living on a million-dollar

2234
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
Fargo

2235
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,624
Crazy

2236
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,184
It's such a

2237
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:22,048
Human social thing where it's like well once I live on a million dollars I have

2238
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,072
Have to justify

2239
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,376
Spending all this money

2240
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,144
Exact

2241
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
Fuel to riches

2242
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,544
Do you have an infinity pool

2243
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,592
A bigger infinite

2244
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,944
Corner of my building

2245
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,992
Question that I I I

2246
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
Wood

2247
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,320
One love to know the answer to

2248
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Which is

2249
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:50,976
I can't imagine living be like if I were if we were suddenly f******

2250
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,000
TV personality

2251
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,536
Who made millions of dollars

2252
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,560
Which I'm not ready

2253
01:49:55,072 --> 01:50:01,216
Right absolutely not ready

2254
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:01,984
You'll be ready

2255
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,056
It's just like

2256
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,080
From LA

2257
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,944
Everyday we watch

2258
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:17,344
Who am I I am the another character

2259
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,904
I don't remember Escape From New York

2260
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,536
I can't imagine living any way other only

2261
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:28,608
Opulence the only luxury that I want is

2262
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,888
To not have to be like

2263
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,424
F*** am I going to make it

2264
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,008
That's the only luxury that I really want

2265
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,800
I think that's the case we're almost there

2266
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,616
8 if you're a person who

2267
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Just keep

2268
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,688
Accelerating the luxuries that they want

2269
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:47,296
You're probably committing a crime I would love for like and I know I've

2270
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,088
I brought this up a couple times and I don't

2271
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,672
Like I've been selling my plasma

2272
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,464
Yeah which I don't find

2273
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,560
Yeah it's good to have some nights

2274
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,328
Time to wrap

2275
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,864
CC again

2276
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,656
Your luxury is like

2277
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,448
Like having

2278
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:11,360
It's a bus trip over there bus trip by hour in the chair

2279
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
You know but it

2280
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:21,088
Exactly where is not a bad time

2281
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:21,856
Is it I think

2282
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,392
Everybody who wants

2283
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,440
Bloviate

2284
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:27,232
About about s***

2285
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,768
Go do that a couple

2286
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,608
Go spend some time down at the plaza

2287
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,912
Go down there

2288
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:35,680
Trying

2289
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,216
To the people

2290
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:38,240
Around here

2291
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:40,288
Go talk to Aunt Jessie

2292
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,056
Experience

2293
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
The culture

2294
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,896
I'm not saying it's a bad culture at all cuz I love it

2295
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
I think that the

2296
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,456
The people down there are awesome

2297
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,504
But I would say it

2298
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
It could open up

2299
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,320
Customize people who

2300
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,344
That

2301
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:55,904
I don't know just

2302
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
I think it a lot of

2303
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:57,952
You don't realize

2304
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
There are

2305
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,000
So many people

2306
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:01,024
Who

2307
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:03,328
ReliOn

2308
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
To make ends meet

2309
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:06,144
Cuz no one going in

2310
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,448
I'm sitting down and having their blood drawn

2311
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:10,240
Then put back into them

2312
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:12,544
For 20-30 $40

2313
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:13,824
Accession

2314
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,616
When's they're doing well

2315
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:17,664
Know everyone down there is doing

2316
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,712
It's

2317
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:25,344
Well if you wanted if you want to even go into like are like if you want to talk about Bernie

2318
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:27,904
You know like

2319
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:34,304
Like at what point do we do we do it like a Mexican

2320
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,352
President or president elect

2321
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:41,472
I believe is his shortened

2322
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,264
Nickname

2323
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,312
His his promise of like

2324
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,384
I am going to turn the presidential house

2325
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,408
Into a f****** Muse

2326
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Museum

2327
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,968
I'm going to live the way that I lived

2328
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:52,736
Last week

2329
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:57,344
I live the way that I lived a year ago I've been delivered Getty Museum

2330
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,136
And then underneath it

2331
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,440
Who knows what they think.

2332
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,512
But that is like

2333
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,792
Yeah

2334
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:16,800
Trick the populist leaders pull I'm going to donate my salary

2335
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,336
Becky's already a f******

2336
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:24,480
Cortez versus Crowley

2337
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
I've already forgotten his name cuz

2338
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,368
One of her big boy

2339
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
You don't f****** live here

2340
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,000
You don't live with any of these people

2341
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:39,840
We talked in a representative government

2342
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:41,888
How can you represent people

2343
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:45,984
Living in a million percent different way than you do

2344
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,800
So maybe that's the third point of

2345
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,336
Along with sending

2346
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,360
The Hague

2347
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,896
Yeah

2348
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,480
And I think they were seeing the the blossom

2349
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:57,760
Beginnings

2350
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
In terms of

2351
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,088
Like actual

2352
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
Citizens

2353
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
4

2354
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,184
Big representative

2355
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
That's always healthier than

2356
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:11,584
Your politicians all of those at work

2357
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:17,216
All of those themselves from high school all of those women

2358
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:17,984
The people of

2359
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,824
Color all of them for whom the Democratic party has voiced

2360
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,872
So much non-support

2361
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,408
If the past year

2362
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:28,224
#walk away

2363
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,784
To keep those people away from Power

2364
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,064
Yes

2365
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:33,600
Wonderful

2366
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:34,880
I don't know

2367
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,952
There's that there's a

2368
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,768
So much a one step forward two

2369
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:41,536
To step back

2370
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,560
To set back

2371
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:45,120
I mean sometimes

2372
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:45,888
Survival means

2373
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:46,656
Going through

2374
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,704
Play Bad

2375
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,544
Perhaps the survival of the democratic party will be

2376
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,824
You getting their comeuppance

2377
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,128
Recognizing

2378
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Like you're saying

2379
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,760
Lb lgbtq

2380
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
There

2381
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:05,856
Whose voice is me

2382
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,880
Need to be heard the most

2383
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,160
Absolutely

2384
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:08,928
People who

2385
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,952
Eyemart

2386
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,720
The most

2387
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,512
At risk

2388
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,280
With

2389
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,072
Liberal platforms

2390
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,352
Surviving

2391
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:19,680
We have very little skin in the game and if

2392
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,704
If we were

2393
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,264
Craven

2394
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,800
Manipulative weirdos

2395
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,592
We should go to the Rain

2396
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,480
We would f****** if we were if we were if we just only cared about

2397
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:33,504
That would be the smart thing

2398
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,296
To do

2399
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,088
We are too smart

2400
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,880
To con people the correct way

2401
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,928
We would feel better about

2402
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,464
We could f******

2403
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,768
If we just

2404
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,352
If we sat down

2405
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,656
And wrote a conservative

2406
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:55,520
We would f****** kallax Rodger

2407
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,360
Rodger

2408
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,640
We could f******

2409
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,688
Rock your world you don't even know

2410
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,528
If we sat down

2411
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,064
You know the nice

2412
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:08,832
Six pack

2413
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,600
We could probably

2414
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,368
Figure out a way

2415
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,416
To mask

2416
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,440
Liberal

2417
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,976
Concern

2418
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,792
Conservative talk

2419
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:21,888
But all of these people seem to not be able to do

2420
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:22,912
Which thankfully

2421
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:31,616
Process bed

2422
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
You see it over and over again

2423
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,224
Yeah

2424
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,528
Anyway anyway let's do it

2425
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,320
We have one more question

2426
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,136
I thought

2427
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:45,184
Another clip about the

2428
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
The Hammonds

2429
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:50,048
And I was going to try and book end

2430
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,816
The show

2431
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:51,840
Fire

2432
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,632
I didn't tell you every

2433
01:56:55,168 --> 01:57:01,312
Ono is there more to know another clip of Alex talking about how great

2434
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,104
They are real arsonist

2435
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,152
Hoover very close to

2436
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,432

2468
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,640
On What occasion

A little pin

2472
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:13,760
Nothing that was going to give him

2473
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,552
NASCAR racing like that but

2474
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,088
Did that I don't know why I feel

2475
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,368
I doubt he was young

2476
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,160
Quote

2477
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:20,928

01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,704
Just for at least 5 minutes

2485
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,008
Steve used a very coarse sandpaper to

2486
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
Standoff

2487
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,312
The report goes on

2488
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,592
Call Dusty told me that

2489
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,640
The process. You should have said trigger warning

2490
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:44,480
The process

2491
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,528
This is not okay

2492
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,552
I'm really not doing great

2493
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,832
Because he knew that

2494
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,112
Steve would continue to process

2495
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:51,392
For a longer. Of time

2496
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,416

Steve told him that it's

2499
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:58,304
He would fillet the initials off Dusty

2500
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,168
Kids is like raising

2501
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
Cows or dogs the reports

2505
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,248
Deep enough

2506
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
And thought that we should

2507
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:22,624
Interesting

2508
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:29,280

60

2519
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,832

Kevin said that he feared that Wentz

2523
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:59,232
You talk to police

2524
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,024
But Stephen will come to the front door in

2525
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:02,560
The paper said

2526
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,096
Asked about their arson

2527
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
Dusty

2528
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,912
The quote Steven started handing out boxes

2529
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:08,192
Strike anywhere matches

2530
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:11,264
And said we're going to light up the whole country on fire

2531
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,544
Dusty told the jury

2532
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:14,848
He said that Steven pointed to a spot on the

2533
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:15,872

2536
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:21,504
Start walking that direction until you run out

2537
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
Dusty

2538
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,320

Strangler Behavior

2544
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,544

2545
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,080

2546
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,616

2558
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
This is

2559
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,096

Yeah there is a strategy

2597
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,864
The other thing

2598
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,168
The very very very very sharp Focus

2599
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:49,728
Is the

2600
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,776
The amount of play Alex

2601
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:52,544

And what have you

And when you really look at the reality of this sort of thing

2607
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,576
The only attack

2608
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,136
But more importantly

2609
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696
Does exist

2610
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:10,976

02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:51,424
Who is the most likely

2630
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,216
To sexually assault somebody

2631
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:55,776
It is if you're f****** youth pastor

2632
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:59,872
Like these are the people who you are protecting

2633
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:03,968
Who are the ones that are good

2634
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:05,760
People with

2635
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528

02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:08,576
Positions

2638

Truck tent

2639
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,136
People's lives are generally

2640
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,416
People who exploit

2641
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
Child molesters are

2642
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,256
What like 90% of the time somebody that

2643
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,536
The family knows and trusts

2644
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:21,632
Or like Uncle and quotes

2645

Cheese on that

2647
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,776
But the reason

2648
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,056
This stuff is so important

2649
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:29,824
Tonight

2650
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,360

Perhaps I should have brought it up I didn't realize how

2653
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,248

2654
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,648

The reality of child abuse

2656
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:47,488
In America

2657
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,024
Is

2658
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:50,816
A lot of it

2659
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:53,632
Is Dawn by familial people

2660
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,912
And bye-bye

2661
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,680
People

2662
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,448
Who are trusted

2663
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:59,520
Like we said in the name of good parenting

2664
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,288
Alex

2665
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,056
Create

2666
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,336
This Boogeyman

2667
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:06,176
Bob Macabre network of satanists

2668
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,736
Demons and what-have-you in order to

2669
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:09,760
You get mad

2670
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:10,784
A problem

2671
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,576
What's the deal with

2672
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,112
And like you said

2673
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,136
I don't think

2674
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,160
Is always the key

2675
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,184
But it does seem

2676
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,976
Pretty well

2677
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
Little lot of times

2678
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:21,792
Deportes

2679
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,560
People who have

2680
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,632
They're the people like

2681
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:26,912
What we have here

2682
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
People like

2683
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:28,960

2684
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,496
He always talks about there that day

2685
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:32,800
Plane

2686
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:41,504
We don't complain about Clinton being friends with Jeffrey Epstein

2687
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,064
As we've gone over multiple multiple times

2688
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
Has been on that guy

2689
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,648
Champlain Trump is good friends with him

2690
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:51,488
Camden interview talking about how he likes his women young

2691
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,328
Crazy took like to me this is like

2692
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,120
This is

2693
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,656
Christina Moore

2694
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
Yeah.

2695
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:03,520
Cuz I don't believe that

2696
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,288
Doesn't know

2697
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,592
I don't believe that

2698
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:12,480
You know what that's a good question haven't heard about this

2699
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,760
And what he does it say

2700
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,040
Snooze

2701
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:17,344
Right

2702
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,136
People will bend over backwards

2703
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:19,904
Often

2704
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,672
2

2705
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,720
Make any kind of excuse for somebody

2706
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:27,072
This is something that they meant

2707
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
This is it what

2708
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:43,456
The Dismount has arrived and this clip I would say actually goes back to conspiracy theory

2709
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:47,040
Earlier in the shower

2710
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:49,344
Peddling conspiracy theories

2711
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,648
That's not fair to me

2712
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:54,208
Trump

2713
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:57,024
The Kennedy had backroom deal going on

2714
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,608
Probably well Alex

2715
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,888
Has Rodger Stone on

2716
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:07,008
So they definitely did

2717
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:11,616
Everything comes up

2718
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:18,016
About

2719
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:22,624
Back of the White House doesn't deny report from a secret deal with Timothy over

2720
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,720
Respond to it

2721
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:37,728
Regal

2722
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,520
2

2723
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,200
Anywhere on the internet

2724
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:49,248
I want to be clear I don't think he's

2725
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:53,856
Totally wrong I'm not a huge fan of the quadrant but at the same time

2726
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,136
If your

2727
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,416
If your targeted

2728
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,720
By Rodger stone is being released

2729
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:00,768
Tractable

2730
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,304
Most fake news site

2731
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,584
You're doing something

2732
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:10,240
You're not my go-to for information

2733
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:13,056
All right field Rodger

2734
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,128
Is false

2735
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:22,528
Is it cannot be taken seriously in any way

2736
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:23,808
Speculation

2737
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,368
I don't know that that happened

2738
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,416
It would not be illegal

2739
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:32,000
If the president Twitter

2740
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:38,400
Is former Clerk

2741
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:40,960
So

2742
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:43,776
They are now having this conversation where they're like

2743
02:08:44,288 --> 02:08:45,568
Now if they

2744
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:50,176
That that wouldn't be which makes me think

2745
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,200
From

2746
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:54,272
Collude with the Russians

2747
02:08:54,528 --> 02:09:00,672
Trump obstruct Justice it's not illegal people illegally

2748
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:06,304
I told you earlier that I feel like there's no concrete footing for us to be on about this

2749
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:09,632
The backroom deal and what have you

2750
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:16,032
Make me more take a

2751
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:23,712
Well if you did it it's totally cool that means I call

2752
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:29,088
There's something even more illegal going on Public Defense

2753
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:29,856
The trout

2754
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:33,952
Okay so maybe

2755
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:38,048
But we don't get we can't confirm

2756
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:42,400
Maybe those meetings were illegal

2757
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:46,496
But illegal doesn't even mean so maybe legal doesn't

2758
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:53,664
He should be able to run everything forever forever by Rudy Giuliani

2759
02:09:55,456 --> 02:10:00,832
Hey I don't have any foreign clients anymore now that I'm in Trump's legal team torrent client

2760
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:07,488
Are mysteriously sort of connected to Trump related

2761
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,400
No big deal

2762
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,728
This brings us to the end

2763
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,752
This ship

2764
02:10:19,008 --> 02:10:20,288
Write with Rodger Stone

2765
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:26,688
He knows but like two damaged

2766
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:27,456
Control kind

2767
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:32,576
Come to the place where now I just

2768
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,112
Instinctively believe

2769
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:38,720
And B is lying about are

2770
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,000
Somehow

2771
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:41,280
Somehow Rodger

2772
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,048
Stone

2773
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,072
Has taken

2774
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:43,840
The

2775
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,656
Lego

2776
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,448
I called him load

2777
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,520
F*** if it doesn't seem like he is

2778
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,800
Everywhere always

2779
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:59,456
But I also think he's wrong all the time like his priority was the one telling Alex is going to be

2780
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:05,856
Supreme Court choice we can always just rely back on him for the fun of it

2781
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,136
It's it's very

2782
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:09,696
Unclear trying to figure out like where is

2783
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,792
Where is the line of f****** around where's the lines like

2784
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:20,192
This is what I care about your about like what are Stone motivation

2785
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:30,688
It's interesting though to visit like

2786
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:34,272
If the trend is very clear within his chaos of being like

2787
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:36,576
I would offer a pre-emptive explanation

2788
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:42,976
Right they do allow for us to have a conversation when the truth comes out that you can still sell

2789
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:43,744
Your iodine

2790
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,536
I'm going to tell you something

2791
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,376
And I'm going to leave enough open space

2792
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:51,680
For me to then tell you anything

2793
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,984
And you might believe me

2794
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:55,264
Regardless

2795
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,544
Like it doesn't

2796
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,128
His starting point is like an open question

2797
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,664
It's always

2798
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,712
He is such a psycho

2799
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:07,040
Like he is such a palm reader where he's doing a cold read

2800
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:10,368
And then he's reacting based on what year

2801
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,000
Oh boy

2802
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,280
No

2803
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,072
He's just doing that cold

2804
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:23,168
And then the the react based on how you react to him

2805
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,448
And it is

2806
02:12:24,704 --> 02:12:25,472
He's so good at

2807
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:28,032
He is he is a sleight-of-hand

2808
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,312
Master

2809
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:31,872
Decades

2810
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,272
Rate we could

2811
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:42,112
Lie to people

2812
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:45,184
Maybe we wouldn't be good at it at first

2813
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,232
But we could well if we put the work

2814
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:53,120
April

2815
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:54,912
You just skip to the end of what I was trying to say

2816
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:59,264
Exactly

2817
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:02,336
High stakes line

2818
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,616
/ roommates

2819
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,640
Goodbye to my friend

2820
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,920
It wouldn't be as high stakes

2821
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,456
Is he lying to

2822
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,480
President of UK

2823
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:17,952
Picture of stone-like was a part of the Stone manafort

2824
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:21,280
Public relationship

2825
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:23,584
Desperate you know what

2826
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,680
They are no slouches in terms of f****** around and international policy

2827
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,216
I'm going to be honest though

2828
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:35,616
I kind of think I would do way better at lying to the president of Ukraine that I would like

2829
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
I don't like that

2830
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:42,272
What person how much more

2831
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:43,040
Terrifying

2832
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:47,648
F******

2833
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:53,024
It would be the Delight of my life before I die

2834
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,608
Before I die I want to lie to a present

2835
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,888
But I think

2836
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:01,472
This takes of it being so high

2837
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:06,848
You're beautiful

2838
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,408
Because

2839
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,944
I don't know if I've ever lied to you

2840
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,760
I really don't

2841
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:18,112
I would have said I would have to really hard about it

2842
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,136
My

2843
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:23,488
But the best possibility for me to have lied to you would be like

2844
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:26,048
You're like hey do you want to do something tonight and I'll be like

2845
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:27,072
I got to go

2846
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:31,424
That would be the most alike that's the way I live

2847
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,032
Do you know what no I would not lie to it I'd like my family about having a

2848
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:42,432
I wouldn't lie to you about that tell you the truth I'm not I'm not in for tonight

2849
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:46,784
Right right right ordering a pizza and even gets badly

2850
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,112
Give me maybe you and I are bad examples

2851
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,648
Cuz like why the f*** would we live

2852
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:55,232
Again

2853
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,304
The depths of

2854
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,584
You like

2855
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,400
The f*** am I going to judge you for

2856
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:09,824
That's a good point

2857
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:13,664
Conversation

2858
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,456
What are you going to lose while I at this point

2859
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:20,576
Right you know that I live my life the way I live it

2860
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:21,600
Neither it's great

2861
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:25,184
There are people that you might want him

2862
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,720
Press that you could lie to

2863
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:32,608
So hard

2864
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:34,656
I don't know man

2865
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:45,408
But it's become something of an anti

2866
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,944
He is f******

2867
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:53,344
Walter White Breaking Bad dealer on Heroes

2868
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,904
I want to see how far

2869
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,184
Like I want to see

2870
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:03,584
What is what is the comeuppance for his level of Life he's like the political Smokey and the Bandit

2871
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:07,168
Is it going to make it

2872
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,216
He is always one step

2873
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:10,240
He is Aladdin

2874
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,264
Need one step

2875
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,288
I had

2876
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:14,336
It's incredible

2877
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,616
I don't think that's

2878
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:22,272
No I don't think so

2879
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:27,136
The booking in like a magiting what he's actually doing I think much more of a s*** head then

2880
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,928
They were wrestling with

2881
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,720
It's more fun than anything else

2882
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:32,256
Because the rest of it really is

2883
02:16:32,512 --> 02:16:33,024
Just like

2884
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:38,400
Alex pretending that you didn't save it fault I'm going to be the Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh great

2885
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:39,168
You know here

2886
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,704
Was involved with bush

2887
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:41,728
Italics

2888
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,080
Indefinitely

2889
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:48,384
In terms of like

2890
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:56,064
US citizens were deemed enemy combatants don't have a right right

2891
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:00,928
I meant Alex not taking into account the reality of who the

2892
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,696
People that run

2893
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:03,744
Pardon

2894
02:17:05,024 --> 02:17:06,048
The fact that they are child

2895
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:07,584
Arrc

2896
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:08,864
Enat

2897
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,680
In some sort of a weird kind of way

2898
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:13,216
No no

2899
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:16,032
But the reality is

2900
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,384
And here's why

2901
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:23,200
The principles that would guide

2902
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:24,736
To be against the

2903
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:26,784
Real

2904
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:28,064
Therefore show

2905
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,112
The things matter

2906
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:31,136
Are they like

2907
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,160
Trump

2908
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,440
Hardening the Hammond

2909
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:35,744
Is it tip of the cap to the malicious

2910
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,048
Yeah it's a tip of the cap to The Sovereign Center

2911
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:40,608
Agreed in the world

2912
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,632
If anybody

2913
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:42,400
Gets it

2914
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:45,728
Message received thank you so much Daddy

2915
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,752
Yep there's that

2916
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:47,776
Yes

2917
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:51,104
That's a great way of putting it thank you so much Daddy

2918
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,384
Heaven are coming in

2919
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,688
Isn't Napolitano who's

2920
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
Nut

2921
02:17:56,224 --> 02:17:58,016
He's a nut

2922
02:17:58,272 --> 02:17:58,784
Alex

2923
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:01,088
Like really wrestled with it is like

2924
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,136
Yeah it'll probably

2925
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:04,672
Score points in terms of

2926
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:05,952
Things that I care about

2927
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:07,744
Not into immigrants he hates

2928
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,024
Women's rights

2929
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:09,792
Choose women

2930
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:12,352
Access to healthcare

2931
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:14,656
So like those are things that are real

2932
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,192
The Chute that's realer

2933
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:19,264
I don't like people

2934
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,664
Some some f***

2935
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,688
Sum fuk

2936
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:27,456
King f***

2937
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:31,296
Write the Liberals case for

2938
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:33,600
Kavanaugh

2939
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:40,000
Yeah exactly right like a light.

2940
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:44,096
You even pretend that that is a headline that is acceptable

2941
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,376
Go fuc

2942
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,680
Are you shiting me

2943
02:18:47,936 --> 02:18:50,496
Liberals

2944
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:55,872
A liberal case for running into a lake and then lighting yourself on fire and then

2945
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:56,896
Hanging yourself

2946
02:18:57,152 --> 02:18:59,712
And then tying a rope to your f****** legs

2947
02:18:59,968 --> 02:19:03,040
With a rock attached to it and then falling into that f****** like

2948
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:03,808
And then

2949
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:05,856
Somehow underwater

2950
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:08,928
Jerking off so hard you light yourself on fire again

2951
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:12,000
The only way

2952
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:12,768
Be something

2953
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:15,328
Pages long

2954
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:17,632
And it's inexpensive treaties

2955
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:24,032
But how liberal doesn't leave caring about people right

2956
02:19:24,288 --> 02:19:27,360
And if it's nailed to a door

2957
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:29,664
You know like that's the only way

2958
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,760
I don't want it on internet but if it's like

2959
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:37,600
You know what we're in a different time maybe

2960
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:42,208
If that's the only way I give a s*** about that and even so I'm biggest quibble with Martin Luther

2961
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:42,976
No safe

2962
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,304
No that's the biggest issue I had with the old

2963
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,096
The whole Protestant Reformation

2964
02:19:48,864 --> 02:19:49,376
No Staples

2965
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,912
But you know like

2966
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:54,496
For a while

2967
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:58,592
Kind of

2968
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:01,920
Comedy shows

2969
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:04,992
Can I put up signs on post

2970
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:12,928
Concealed carry concealed carry staple gun

2971
02:20:18,816 --> 02:20:19,328
People posting

2972
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:20,608
Warning

2973
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:21,632
About like

2974
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:23,680
Reactionary Neo-Nazi signs

2975
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:24,704
Put up anime

2976
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
Play hide razor burn

2977
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:26,752
Behind them

2978
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:30,336
Luke Bryan

2979
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,360
Verify

2980
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:33,408
Like that I don't know why but

2981
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:35,200
This on a visceral level

2982
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:36,480
That is f***** me up

2983
02:20:36,736 --> 02:20:37,760
4 days

2984
02:20:39,552 --> 02:20:41,088
I don't really know if it's like

2985
02:20:41,344 --> 02:20:42,112
Endemic

2986
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:44,160
But just the idea of it

2987
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:45,952
So f****** like

2988
02:20:46,208 --> 02:20:47,744
That's so evil

2989
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,768
Ears ears

2990
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,560
The way I immediately react

2991
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:52,608
That to me sounds

2992
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:54,144
Exactly like the

2993
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,448
Somebody's putting razor blades

2994
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:58,240
In your Halloween candy it's possible

2995
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:01,056
Right it sounds exactly like that and you have the same time

2996
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
The people who are doing it

2997
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:03,872
Steam like

2998
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:04,896
Do that

2999
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:06,176
It's money

3000
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:10,016
It bothers me because I

3001
02:21:10,272 --> 02:21:11,552
The people who would do that

3002
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:17,952
I'm not smart enough to think of that idea now they're going to throw it

3003
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:22,048
That's a great way to be more evil than we already are

3004
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:25,888
It's terrifying that's the way the modern

3005
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:32,288
Holy s*** that's how we are the most terrifying thing that we are aware of is razor blades behind

3006
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:38,944
Flyers are much more terrified about a lot of other things but like on a visceral level

3007
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,808
What's up like that

3008
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:44,576
Feel Again

3009
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,368
Or like being surprised by

3010
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:53,024
The momentum is all like

3011
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,328
Yeah

3012
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:56,864

3014
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:04,032
Just like the Liberals argument for why

3015
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:06,848
Is okay for the Supreme Court

3016
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:18,112

No elephants

3019
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,768
No but you are

3020
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:25,792
On par with

3021
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:28,864
Scatman

3022
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,168

We're not even going to wind up doing a solid whose going to go f*** themselves

We're going to wind up dealing with this f***

3045
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:29,536
At least another eight years before eventually

3046
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:30,304
Somebody

3047
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:33,376
Birds with f****** country to the ground

02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:39,264
To the f****** groud
