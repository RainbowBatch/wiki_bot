1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
College vype.com

4
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,144
Alex Emerick on the ongoing adventures of

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Dream swirling

6
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
Yeah I what will get there

7
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
What's up

8
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
My bright spot today is bright spot of anger

9
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,000
The anger is that no one told me about a thing existing before

10
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
And I stumbled across it and now it's all I want to do

11
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,888
I found that on YouTube

12
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
There are a bunch of channels

13
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
That are just like

14
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Estate set up a camera and animals show up

15
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Fat bear week like 10 years but I thought that was

16
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,648
The special event no man realize that there were these cameras that you could just watch

17
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,792
Live all the time in desert and it's a watering hole

18
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,656
About 5 minutes I'm watching the civics or Ibex whatever to pronounce that

19
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Drink from this Watering Hole like this is fascinating

20
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
Big showed up sitting alone in the apartment I cheer

21
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
The appearance of another animal I'm telling you right now you can get so many camera

22
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,440
Letter just 24/7 on a nest with eggs in there

23
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
And it is yours I do I don't want that that's too much like tension entire life just sitting

24
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't want I don't want to be like waiting for the egg to hatch or something like that that's too high stakes

25
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
But watching the world

26
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,040
I like that you are in some sense digitally retreating to the wilderness

27
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Like you can't go and move into the middle of the woods but you can through the vision of a desire is been there

28
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
This is the only way that I can manifest it look at that guy

29
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
It's all about you what your partner is a teacher

30
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
And that means that right around teacher

31
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
This time of year

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
All of the Girl Scouts circle like vultures on week teachers

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Ready to pounce

34
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
You do your part right right so despite the fact that I'm sure it's in some way some sort of evil cartel the girl

35
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Girl Scouts

36
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
A s*** ton of boxes awesome

37
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Of our order still open I'm pretty sure I might need you to put in an order for me

38
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
I've got some okay by the second hand

39
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:11,136
Super intent to distribute boxes we have Samoa

40
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Tagalog Tagalog

41
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
I've had my fill of those

42
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
You don't want to know okay that is a pretty bracelet

43
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Look I like sweets

44
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,759
Say that I like sweets when times are tough

45
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
What things are good

46
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm so Jordan today we have an episode to go over that is being log into works and

47
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,375
We've teased this a little bit but not very specifically

48
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
Things like I've mentioned that I have some side things I'm working on

49
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
Things like when beginning of December

50
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
We had to pass nobody yes

51
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
And with all the become clear

52
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Ion today's episode

53
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,279
Looks like a little moment to say thank you and hello doesn't do walks

54
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,375
The first of the revs Lang thank you so much

55
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,519
The reverend's Lange properties maybe I'm not sure

56
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,527
We have Jordan thank you so much you are now a policy wonk

I'm a policy wonk me up

58
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023
But we also do have a couple of technocrats in the back

59
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Sorry Adam

60
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Made me give more money to Dan and Jordan because bear won't stop howling about globalist

61
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
I'm a policy wonk I have risen above

62
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
Miami star

63
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Go take a little break you down

64
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
A list for me

65
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,927
And then we're going to come back

66
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
And I'm going to start the show over

67
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
F*** you

68
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
I got plenty work for you but at the end of the day

69
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:38,335
F*** you and your new world order and f*** the horse you rode in on and all your s***

70
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
Maybe the next few moments broadcast

71
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

72
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

73
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
And you never see me again

74
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
That's really what I want to do

75
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,743
I never want to come back here again I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

76
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,071
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

77
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
I'll be better tomorrow he may be

78
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
So thank you all very very much so Jordan we have some breaking news

79
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:14,175
Who's in the world of Alex and recording this here on Tuesday of

80
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
Pressing issues that we talked about on Friday

81
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
We

82
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
Have for you today

83
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
An episode where we will be discussing some depositions from Alex's San Diego case

84
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,679
And I felt like you know if we're going to be talking about this we should probably check in

85
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
Discuss how all this came about circumstances

86
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
Conversation

87
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
With Mark Langston

88
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:58,207
Well joining us here in the virtual podcast

89
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,327
Over Zoom

Did she like the honeycomb hideout there was such a good man that the Bishop Don Magic Juan

91
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
We're off track

92
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:17,663
Joining us here in the honeycomb hideout

00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,527
Aziz lead counsel for the plaintiffs and the Sandy Hook

94
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
Lawsuits against Alex Jones

95
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,647
Mike Baxter welcome back

96
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
I'm not using the name

97
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,911
That's fine so frankly there's a no boys allowed policy

98
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
I can respect the rules

99
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,103
So welcome I we wanted to do a little preface to this episode because it's

100
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Monumentous occasion I think it's stitches is how I would describe it

101
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,111
Some would say narrative twist

102
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
In things and so

103
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
What are you taking away into the present to give us give us the lowdown on what's up here

104
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Regular listeners now

105
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
I've been following the podcast for a little while now

106
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,263
And they've been doing some analysis of our lawsuits and in such intoxicating

107
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
And talk to these wacky gentleman

108
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,175
And I had become sort of I guess you could say over the course of Lost

109
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Peripherally aware

110
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Of the workout

111
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Snitch

112
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Sometimes

113
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
You know mainstream media is even I see profiles

114
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
In Fairly

115
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Publication describing

116
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
The unparalleled

117
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
You talk about the grey lady

118
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
But you got to take that with a grain of salt to do the same thing newspaper

119
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Iraq

120
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Play Store

121
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,943
I went ahead and checked it out and

122
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
Darn this guy really does know a lot about Alex Jones

123
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
And I was

124
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
Me and my partner Bill actually had to do that

125
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
And so we watched

126
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,839
Instead of a couple weeks and

127
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
They probably flew by

128
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983
Time flies when your brain is melting

129
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,359
And then I knew

130
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
Not

131
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Tribulus

132
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
Facts on my my brain in perception of the world

133
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
So I guess I was so excited to meet you

134
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Who's been living in this

135
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
Damn do a hell of a lot about Alex Jones

136
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,047
Judgment

137
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
Discovery

138
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Which is about the plaintiff

139
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
They were harmed by some of this condo

140
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
I'm in NS required to take us

141
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Corporate

142
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Alex Jones

143
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
And in doing so

144
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
I knew that I could use

145
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Dance

146
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
In this process

147
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,783
So that's why I reached out to Danone sa Dan would you consult on this case

148
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Ann and Dan said you know what I I'd be happy to do that

149
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Recharge

150
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Completely pro bono

151
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
In my defense I said no

152
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
I think you're right

153
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
The way you're saying this is like

154
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,055
You asked and I said yes and I don't think that's exactly accurate I struggled with the decision

155
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Because of the

156
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,919
The potential ethical implications of like doing this podcast

157
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
And like inserting myself

158
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
In some way

159
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
You know I would never I would never want to put somebody in your position who's a commentator and a person who has collected knowledge on chosen this way

160
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,535
In the position of testifying at trial or being a witness to jury would ever hear from

161
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,911
What happened

162
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,263
You can tell I from here to screaming

163
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
And I think you know

164
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Certainly

165
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
You can so fun cases like this

166
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Provide

167
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
Some of them do charge

168
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
And that would have been totally above board to do but but I really

169
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
You know II

170
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Is it a lot

171
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
I mean I'm not I'm not going to

172
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Definitely

173
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Really appreciate it

174
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,511
I love the Jets

175
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
You say nothing

176
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Pro bono but I don't want to put you on a pedestal because so many people

177
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Unrivaled in my career

178
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
People will step out of the woodwork

179
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
I'm happy

180
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
You whenever I can

181
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,711
And so yeah damn Dance come aboard and has been helping me quite a bit

182
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
In terms of doing this case

183
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
And one of the big surprise for

184
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Is that damn

185
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Personally accompanied me

186
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
As my consultant

187
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Of the

188
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Corporate representative

189
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
And if mr.

190
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,191
Yeah so your humble narrator

191
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
Not more than

192
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Or feet

193
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Across the table

194
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Johnson South Bend

195
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Representative

196
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,735
And I want to be clear just be in case anybody has any kind of misgivings

197
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
I did not interact with them

198
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
In any way

199
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Rick

200
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,183
I was a silent

201
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Person in the room

202
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,791
And I've had no contact with them outside of the room

203
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
So it's not like I shook Alex's hand or like

204
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
The reason I said no initially cuz I was slightly worried for your physical safety to be in the same

205
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Camera with Alex Jones

206
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,623
Peoples guts in like a good old Teddy will get to that later

207
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Sandworm

208
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
You know already dammit

209
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Helping me formula

210
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
A person who can put his finger on Spa

211
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
I know I know

212
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Is it true you need to ask

213
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
What

214
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
So your service is really

215
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
I really want

216
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
There's there aren't

217
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Alex Jones for as much of a phenomenon as he is

218
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
And for

219
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Culturally

220
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Influential

221
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
He remains relatively understudy

222
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Both in

223
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
McKennan Park

224
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Actually

225
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Strange how much

226
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Mythos

227
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Is

228
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
Very shallow

229
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
People don't really dig down

230
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Into that was

231
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
That that was really really valuable

232
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Irishman

233
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
It's overwhelming and thank you for

234
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
For the kind words I don't know I'm surprised that when

235
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
You came back you didn't report to me how invaluable your work was you kind of downplayed it which is not like you at all

236
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,583
Till you come back boastful like it weren't for me this whole thing would have fallen apart that's you

237
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,727
You right I got the flashing it's out of my system before I went cuz I bought a new suit

238
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
That was that was kind of my way of like a little

239
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,407
Walk around with something

240
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,271
Where do you where we got you a suit there was an adventure for the both of us

241
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,367
Let me tell you what's up well

242
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,719
Not great and I get dirty real fast

243
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
I clean up okay

244
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Talked about

245
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
Before you had decided to help me and consult with me on this

246
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Is that if you were going to be

247
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
Offering me advice

248
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Singing some of the proceedings

249
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
You know

250
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
Part of your in system Quizlet

251
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
What you doing I need to be able to continue to do that about

252
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
And if you were an expert witness

253
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
You probably shouldn't be doing

254
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Right because eventually your testimonies going to have to

255
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
Yeah but if you're just

256
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
And when it comes to things that are in the pub

257
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
I couldn't stop you if I were

258
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
You have a First Amendment right

259
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Going on

260
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
What was the 1st Amendment

261
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:16,895
Take that Mark you can't stop us even if you f****** wanted to

262
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Creative right you know

263
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
We'll never know.

264
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
It's it's

265
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
And I knew for instance

266
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Deposition

267
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
If they did the

268
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Public record would be

269
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Be part of that and what happened

270
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
So that your listeners understand

271
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,263
There's a protective order of confidentiality in the case

272
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
And it provides a process

273
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
What's by whichever party

274
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Give testimony

275
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
It provides them in half

276
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Do that

277
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
And in this

278
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Much as they have

279
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
Chose not to

280
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
So very

281
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
The deposition of Alex Jones

282
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
Cast into the public domain when they became on challenge

283
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Filing

284
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
In this case

285
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
And so there's been seduced

286
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,215
Documents

287
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
In those depositions already

288
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
Uninstall that's not my public record

289
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
So now

290
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
You're a little bit about it

291
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Talk to you about

292
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,575
MMA I want to stress to that like

293
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
It's

294
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
I can't

295
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
What are the downsides of me

296
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,327
Like being in the position of like doing this episode and being there sure is that

297
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,375
Obviously I experienced things

298
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,935
Some of those things I can't talk about

299
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Because

300
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
They are

301
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:52,127
Part of what is in the public record there will you know there will be a lot of things that

302
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm not really material to the analysis of the depositions themselves

303
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
You know I have

304
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
You know some thoughts

305
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
If you wanted to you you couldn't even talk about

306
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
The mutated

307
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
Second human being coming out of his chest

308
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
Kawato I believe was his name I told you that in confidence you can't talk about

309
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,567
Kuato okay that's my

310
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
Bi-polar Jordans

311
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Oh my gosh

312
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
That's kind of

313
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
Not not for you because you know.

314
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
But but so that the audience understands how you're talking to

315
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
There are some brown

316
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
That that Dad has to observe when talking about these things

317
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
I want to that is that

318
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Because his

319
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
Consulting position gives them access to things that do not become public

320
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
There there something to eat

321
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,615
Like conversations we had in between breaks and stuff like that obviously

322
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Everybody's actually

323
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
Do you know you the things that you go into a deposition room

324
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
And in 90% of what

325
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,343
On the record videotape Rollin there's a transcript

326
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,951
10% of that downtime is off-the-record there things that happened there 2 off the Record

327
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Obviously anything off.

328
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
But now we're

329
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Where

330
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Made

331
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Call the mother corporate names

332
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Just the irony

333
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
But the fact

334
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
The choice

335
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
Hours that came to be

336
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Not make these

337
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
I am very

338
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
I believe

339
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
Those people who are following this case

340
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
You understand

341
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
There is a lot of enlightening

342
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Information

343
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Yeah do you speak

344
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
I'm glad then

345
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
What are the wonderful person I process

346
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
Is that when things do get into the public record this way

347
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,727
That Court proceedings can be critically discussed

348
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
And that's something I'm goddamn

349
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
But yeah there aren't there are certain

350
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
No, too

351
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
I probably had to close out probably edited out

352
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,743
But yeah it's like if you asked me what Alex smells like I'll have to cut that up

353
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Likely

354
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,983
Freshly done laundry in the spring of Normandy

355
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
No none of that kind of the thing is is

356
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Dengar

357
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Inside baseball process

358
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
Legal proceeding that a lot of people don't normally get

359
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Cuz I spy testimony but it's not in a courtroom

360
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
You know we were we were in a friend of mine's law office

361
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
I'm in

362
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
You know you're in this very

363
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Where you at

364
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
Videographer in the room

365
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Reporters

366
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,143
Taking everything down you got all your pairs of lawyers in the room and you got the witness

367
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
And you're all in this this room together

368
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Jennifer

369
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
What are these depositions I think when is long as I-5

370
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,871
Yeah yeah the corporate representative going with Dario was

371
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
Most of the day

372
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
Yeah yeah it was very

373
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,063
But I'm actually you know the thing is we've we've talked about these depositions

374
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
And in the course of caulking for consulting firms

375
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
That's all

376
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
And I'm actually

377
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
He's become a little more public

378
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Hear what people's reaction

379
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Brodersen

380
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Yeah cuz unlike I think

381
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Jones's first step

382
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
The first corporate representative

383
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
Which was very shallow and very guarded and very mockery

384
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
I mean it was just a kind of a farce

385
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
I think this is a farce in its own way

386
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Slightly different farts

387
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
Yes

388
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
Comedy of errors

389
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,952
We We All Electronics know that we recently

390
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
I brought a motion for sanctions

391
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Based on the scoreboard

392
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
I want with Daria

393
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
With Daria correct in and that was because

394
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
They had been ordered four times

395
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
Give a corporate deposition in the course of these cases

396
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
The first 25 digits in Show

397
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
And in the second space it robbed

398
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
SpongeBob do

399
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,432
Oblivious to the fact

400
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
That the wall required him to

401
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Repairing anyway

402
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,088
I think what you meant to say was I f****** Legend

403
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah that's going to go down in history as making one of the greatest episodes of all time

404
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:29,888
Call Rob the Sharpshooter

405
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
They also tune engineering

406
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Friday in Ni naar judges straight

407
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
It was a

408
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
An offense

409
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Deposition

410
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Daddario

411
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,992
Yes exactly in the wake of an already

412
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Offensive

413
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Depositions from robbed

414
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
To get your act together for this they still haven't

415
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,208
But we recently brought that motion Friday

416
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
They were sanctioned

417
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
And I want to stay the

418
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
This is now

419
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
738

420
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
Open find

421
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,912
Before ever actually have

422
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
Pretty wild

423
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,800
And so we're still trying to see what the full fall out of all that is going to be

424
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,104
But yeah this did this did not go well

425
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:17,504
It's it's all you know it's disappointed when I showed up in Austin

426
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:22,112
Because you'd only told me there was a corporate representative I didn't know who was going to be

427
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,488
I was really excited for the possibility that we get another round with two I thought that would be a lot of fun

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,816
I meant learning that I was going to be Dario's like man she might

429
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Be competent

430
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
The best

431
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
I thought it was so interesting and we'll get into this like in more by new detail in the course of the episode but

432
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,824
It's Robert Jewish but in a very different way

433
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
It's beautiful yeah it's

434
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah it's it's really interests

435
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Yes

436
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Like I say

437
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
That's why I'm glad it

438
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
I think this was I want to say this for the audience's benefit I think this was one of the

439
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
More difficult things

440
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
That I've had to do first of all to not talk about this beginning of December

441
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,776
Was when I came down to Austin and not being able to mention it or not being able to

442
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Be like

443
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,664
All the information that I had that was in those depositions I had to not know

444
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
That was hard for you but that's easy for you I didn't say anything which is the real feel

445
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
F****** accomplishment that's what I want to get across here

446
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Somehow I didn't break

447
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,024
Who you going to tell your dog

448
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
It was really challenging and

449
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,776
I'm glad that you know we're on the other side of it now because it is a bit of a relief

450
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
And then the second

451
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
The Second Challenge was really like

452
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,432
Questioning prior to agreeing to come down

453
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Whether or not this was

454
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
An instance of

455
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,184
I'd like sort of affecting the content of the thing recovery

456
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,280
Really wrestled with that and I struggled with that question cuz it's been something that we

457
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
A policy that we've tried to maintain

458
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
As it relates to

459
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,448
Alex's show people to call in

460
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,288
They showed to f*** with him in order for us to cover it on the show

461
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,896
I felt like this was important enough of a thing to do

462
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

463
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,296
I need anything I can do to help

464
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
The families is something that the

465
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Is

466
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:35,232
More important than our show evil

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
So

468
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:41,120
Therapist that and also it wouldn't have the same

469
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
Actual

470
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,776
Presentation is someone prank calling him

471
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,848
This was assisting in

472
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,480
These are questions that may be fruitful to ask this is Beazer ideas to you know

473
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
The check in on

474
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,832
I think that is materially different then

475
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
The way that we

476
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
Haddock non-engagement

477
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,256
In the past but I think it's on the right side of it

478
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,864
This case is so different than most forms of litigation because of its subject matter

479
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,216
That when you might need for instance an expert on

480
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
You know

481
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,520
Pipe metallurgy

482
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Plant explode

483
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,616
There's no chance of that same person is going to be critical to

484
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Critically covering

485
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
In the media are you're right that's not a thing

486
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
What was interesting about this cases when you're in this kind of media litigate

487
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
The only people in this country who are genuine Bonafide X

488
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Rapunzel are those who how

489
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,952
All of this media career any gayson

490
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
And in our our first

491
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Sabine bruchmann Kowski

492
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
Who is the managing editor of Snopes

493
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
And and she had

494
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:53,568
I feel like she sort of a modern-day Cassandra of she was saying in 22

495
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
1540

496
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
14

497
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
Here's what fake news

498
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
The same sort of discussion of

499
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Weather

500
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
There is this

501
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
Scientist that says

502
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:16,608
The subject of your inquiry should be kept in isolation and you even your you you shouldn't let your interactions with their effect

503
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Observation

504
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:22,240
Right when there's beat the idea that Brooke had the entire play

505
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,568
Critically government

506
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
About

507
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Is because

508
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Danger

509
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
Apartment

510
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
And therefore to offer that X

511
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,296
Batista people were trying to vindicate that the court of all is

512
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Is a noble cause

513
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,392
And that's why I asked

514
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
That's a different type of

515
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
It's so strange

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,584
I think it makes it very difficult for people in your position to ever testify

517
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,240
I could be impeached as a witness so easily based on 100 things I said on my pocket

518
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,896
I mean it doesn't just know exactly I'll stand by everything I've ever seen

519
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:07,296
I think I screamed at you about the alien phones getting pregnant

520
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,880
Linda Pugh playing on the stand no good

521
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,000
Nearby Jordan on the witness stand and I'm thinking bad loan Order episodes left it was just shaking

522
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:22,400
Let's go

523
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
No that's not nice

524
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,520
I would be far more clever you do the scene from the critic

525
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
Oh yeah

526
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
Sister gives me gas

527
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,944
Alright Darius Gilroy

528
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
We had to go to Academia

529
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
Ride Like the people were far out

530
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Great Hulu

531
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Who kind of Buicks

532
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
And as much as they

533
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,440
Study his effects

534
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
Nobody

535
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
In this country has studied.

536
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Internal mechanic

537
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,376
Infowars workout stories works out

538
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
Process work

539
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
Nobody said

540
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
I mean it's just

541
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,496
There's nobody who's in ended

542
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,848
It's weird that there was this vacuum that when people saw what you were doing the reason it was so well-received

543
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
I need for that

544
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Nobody has started

545
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
So that's

546
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
And I'm going to jump out the window

547
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
See I thought I thought the way it worked was

548
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
If you're fighting against Godzilla you don't go to like a regular old army or whatever you have to get Mom

549
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,888
Night so if you're going to depose Alex Jones you can't just go with some X

550
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
Somewhere at a goddamn University

551
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Weather for King Ghidorah

552
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
You can beat King Ghidorah

553
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,664
This might surprise you Jordan but my my

554
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Litigation

555
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,528
Strategy has not been mostly informed by 1960s rko'd

556
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Tokyo pictures

557
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
With monster movies

558
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
We had some different choices

559
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
Godzilla did not immediate

560
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Then I guess we have some differences of opinion cannot be resolved

561
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
What time I think I think Mark strategy probably speaks for itself

562
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Movie

563
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:10,688
Well I I want to say thanks for inviting me to to do this and also thanks for

564
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Coming to do this

565
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
A little intro piece

566
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
I think it's important to

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,136
You know recognize some of the

568
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
McCants

569
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Of what's going to come up

570
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,048
Headlight laying the ground rules is important

571
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,680
Oh and I don't think I could have explained how this was made public record I don't know if I fully understood it

572
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,288
Here's the best part

573
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:42,688
Angry with that

574
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,040
Advantageous

575
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
Saint 14

576
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,416
You know it is if that's where they stand they want to let it all be

577
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Beginning you know we've had

578
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,000
Revive documentary

579
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,840
We we have HBO's filming everything

580
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
And they've been

581
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Receptive to that

582
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,448
Nobody has even asked for a gag order

583
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,752
Because God would Jones's say

584
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
I mean if you just if you just turn on

585
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Why what's up

586
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,664
So it's advice counterbalance that

587
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,712
With a with a good thorough

588
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
And None Shall

589
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
I'm glad you're going to

590
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Well

591
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,744
Awesome I think I think on that note if unless you have anything else to add we should get to that

592
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,144
Thorough thorough

593
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
Thank you for a

594
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:46,176
The setup here so I was there

595
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,808
You were there

596
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:58,208
I like considered the the idea of like just going over these and not mentioning that I

597
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,608
Mario little

598
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:11,008
These depositions are a my name is

599
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
Real air of impropriety that I would have covered them and not brought that up

600
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,808
A show about us with a host dedicated as to find the transcripts from this.

601
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,696
Position to discover that you were there

602
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,304
Today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over

603
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,704
The deposition is the corporate representative

604
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
Daria Alex's assistant

605
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
What other.

606
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:54,528
Very mysterious person in the world of Infowars and now we get to

607
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,184
About 6 hours

608
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Position is Alex

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,888
And we were going to be going over Alex's first and then darya's for service structural reasons

610
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:14,752
And Jordan has an out-of-context drop from Alex's deposition

611
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Parker Banks

612
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
You know who that is

613
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:23,712
No liar to be alive

614
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
Big sis dare he

615
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:36,512
Alex knows damn well who Jar Jar Binks is

616
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:42,656
Deposition Bart is bringing up some of the talking about Sandy Hook stop at Alex

617
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Gave it his response

618
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,240
I'm to the general question

619
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,568
When things you just talked about is that you have since this lawsuit

620
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Started

621
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
You said some things about

622
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
I said things about

623
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:59,552
Organizations in groups that want to get rid of the First Amendment trying to use me as a case to do it

624
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
Okay well I what I'm really talking about is you said things about Sandy Hook

625
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Self-correct

626
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
I have I have talked about

627
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,280
About the coverage surrounding it in a lawsuit sand

628
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
That ongoing process

629
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
Well actually want to ask you about a little something else

630
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
What what

631
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:18,496
Every second one thing that you have said a few times

632
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,312
Is that in terms of when you did

633
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Say that Sandy Hook was completely

634
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
Fake synthetic

635
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
They're actors

636
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Xcetera

637
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
You said that you've apologized

638
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
Correct

639
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Well first off I said I can see how people see that and I also when people said

640
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,000
Please apologize. And I seen some of the anomalies that I think we're

641
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
Wrong

642
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,864
People requesting online

643
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
I'm sorry for

644
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
For questioning up Sandy Hook but it wasn't intended

645
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
False wait

646
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,568
I really thought maybe it didn't happen

647
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
And then

648
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,384
Intensified

649
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
And people

650
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944
Being falsely saying that I was

651
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,016
Currently saying those things and then exaggerating when I said

652
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,088
As away as a political weapon that Hillary Clinton was using

653
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
To beat me over the head with it

654
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,672
In 2016 on record run

655
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,952
National

656
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
Against me

657
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
Play edited types of me

658
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Talking about Sandy Hook

659
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,632
First of all injection Don responsive

660
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
A couple moments

661
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Now there's an objection of not responsive cuz you just rambling about the first of all first of all

662
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,832
You talked about Sandy Hook itself after you've been sued

663
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:43,232
Hillary

664
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,328
No question

665
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,424
A couple times where it's just like

666
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
It's a it's out it's outrageous

667
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,384
Mark will have to ask between Alex and sometimes like you know what question

668
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
And there is

669
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,504
Slight confusion

670
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
And so

671
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
You know the question then comes up of like

672
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
You're saying this is your you're

673
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,232
Understanding of how you covered Sandy Hook and then

674
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
We're going to be able to play for the jury

675
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,912
The opposite this is why should they not see you as a liar

676
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,264
Good question is where Alex goes with that

677
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,824
First of all non-responsive

678
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
Second of all

679
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,200
You mr. Jones you understand this jury is going to watch the videos

680
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:38,784
Of Usain unequivocally not I see how people

681
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Unequivocally

682
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,904
Sing Sandy hooker

683
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,928
You don't get to interrupt

684
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,464
You understand that sir

685
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
You're here to answer questions

686
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
For this jury

687
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
And I want you to listen to the quest

688
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
You know this jury's going to watch

689
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Videos

690
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Of Usain multiple-time

691
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Over and over again

692
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,008
Sandy Hook is completely fake

693
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,288
Completely synthetic

694
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,312
It is not

695
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Real

696
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:06,176
Right and you're going to sit here in this chair and say oh actually what I said

697
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
Actually what I said is I could see how some other

698
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,040
Could think it was fake

699
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
You know the jury's going to see those videos

700
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,392
And you know they're going to hear your words

701
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,416
Do you think the

702
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Seriously whatsoever when they

703
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Things you said

704
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Dino

705
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,680
I know that the jury is going to say I always heard that

706
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:34,080
People are innocent until proven guilty not guilty until proven guilty they choose that the systems actually scared for me to pay

707
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Truth is deep down

708
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,992
I have still have real questions about Sandy hook him up with your mom

709
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:46,368
And the CIA visiting Adam anthem for half of the FBI's I was in an entry news

710
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,440
And just all the bizarreness that went on

711
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,024
The public still has real question just like it about jussie Smollett

712
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,864
A baby that never actually die or wmds in Iraq

713
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,936
Or just you the Gulf of Tonkin or operation Northwoods

714
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
Or Bubba Wallace or or

715
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,848
You're so many of these things have happened most of these hate crimes and type things end up

716
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Being false flag so I still

717
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,552
When I look at events question and say could this could this be staged we look for telltale signs what does that mean

718
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
Means that he is going to take some lettuce and cheese and put it between two big slices

719
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,328
Is a chicken called a sandwich

720
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
So we'd like response to this question because

721
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
What are you trying to say is that events sometimes or suspicious

722
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,016
His list baby he doesn't understand the conversation

723
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
People didn't think that the Roe v Wade baby was dead

724
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
That's the whole point of the storylines that is kind of a big dog

725
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,632
Beginning of December in this deposition recently

726
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
I'm pretty sure he still thinks the rovi way baby was d.b. Cooper though so I think he does believe that

727
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
That is if everything is connected

728
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
And then

729
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,528
You have the Gulf of Tonkin

730
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:24,928
The wmds in Iraq is in the same conversation as Jesse small

731
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Wallet and Bubba Wallace racially-based

732
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:37,728
Antagonistic narrative I don't I don't know if Bubba Wallace's situation with the NASCAR

733
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
Garage is on the scale of lying about weapons of mass destruction would say there is

734
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:50,528
I would also say that now in the deposition for damage

735
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Address for the case you've already lost

736
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:58,976
Not the best time to say I still have questions about the screens move

737
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,704
Cute easy giving these examples when he's liking all of these hate crimes end up being staged or whatever that

738
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,080
Are you compare Sandy Hook a hate-crime to you is that is

739
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:19,456
Is this the connective tissue it makes no sense it's just I mean all crimes

740
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Involve hate

741
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,392
So aren't all hate crimes crimes and crimes

742
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:33,792
Strange tactic that's being deployed and I would advise against it

743
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
I'm loving it so far we're two clips in I think he's going to win this thing there is

744
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
To be a friend of like you're describing is doubling down

745
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,408
Why not it's really that me we've already lost

746
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,504
Yeah so Mark kind of pushes on that that angle

747
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Mr. Jones

748
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Video of you

749
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
Because of

750
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,864
Question that

751
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:18,848
Female synthetic everything is

752
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,456
Opportunity

753
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
So now you're back

754
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
Your audience

755
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
No that's

756
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,888
That I'm proud of the video and I'm proud of my statement in this full context

757
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
They will love to ride a sassy line

758
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:49,056
American traditional challenge authority

759
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,128
Turn out to be

760
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
Okay I will be Vindicated

761
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,743
Marks of at you can hear Mark smiling you can hear her laugh

762
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,607
A couple times to Jerry's ejacular nature

763
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,887
Going on here

764
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,543
This this is a good this seems to be a good line of questioning

765
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
Preceded like you lost this case by default right now you're back to suggesting the Sandy Hook was fake

766
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
There's probably no consequences

767
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Push down a little

768
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Please keep that promise

769
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Okay but second

770
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
What has happened here

771
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
Is now that

772
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,583
You got beaten Court

773
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
Now that it has been granted. I didn't get beaten Court

774
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,727
Organized crime syndicate

775
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
Default has been granted

776
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,615
Pretend anymore.

777
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
That's what's going on

778
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,783
I know that's not what's happened.

779
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,319
They definitely sanction

780
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
With all the stuff we produced

781
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,391
I believe is a fraud

782
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,183
Because they're scared

783
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,535
I want to tell Jerry that this man is guilty now you decide how guilty no generators

784
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Josiah

785
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
If someone is guilty or not

786
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
. not how guilty they are

787
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
You got can try to do

788
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,703
All your antifreeze Peak stuff

789
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,263
All you're doing is waking up America

790
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:29,919
There's a real Trend here the beginning of the deposition of like

791
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
A bit of going back and forth

792
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:37,855
Let's have a little bit of getting us out of the system,

793
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:41,183
Actual solid questions and like pieces of evidence

794
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:47,583
On the back but it almost feels like let's let's warm up a little with

795
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:53,983
Alex wants to do that a little bit

796
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
He gets he gets to throwing out stuff like but people do have questions I'm proud of this state

797
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
I meant that maybe I actually was right when I used to

798
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:13,183
Down out of the way I'm up top will get all the

799
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:19,583
100% anybody celebrating anything yes absolutely

800
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,655
All you're doing is waking up emergency

801
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Alright so let's just be honest about what this is

802
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:31,615
You got mad after you got defaulted and you lashed out by saying that Sandy Hook was fake again that's what

803
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
No

804
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
I have privately

805
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
Call Mike ruane.

806
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
I said I really have real pleasure

807
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Truth about this

808
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,135
I can't 100% prove it was

809
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Totally staged

810
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,207
But the CIA was definitely involved

811
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
And

812
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,279
And that came out and then I was

813
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
I was told again

814
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:54,143
By high-level folks in the CIA that it was stage back in the time

815
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:57,215
That's why I went with them and also with Wolfgang halbig said

816
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,311
And other so I really believe that that that that that she looked at

817
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
I'm going to guess the CIA prison Alex's referring to my Beastie pechanec actual real source

818
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
I'm so

819
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
Sure that came up

820
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,743
I necessarily and episodes that we've done

821
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:26,143
The CIA wasn't involved in the shooting but when the FBI released the redacted reports of the effects defecation it include

822
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
Interviews with people who knew Adam Lanza and his mother

823
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:35,871
There's one interview that they conducted with the person whose name is redacted which was filed in a report that was dated December 16th

824
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
2012

825
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,759
This was a friend of Lanza's mother Nancy who had her over to the house periodically

826
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,159
Quote what Adam Lanza was in 9th grade Nancy told redacted into a government computer system

827
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Adam had made it through the second level of security and when he tried to breach the third level the screen went black in the authorities

828
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,399
Showed up Atlanta's door at 36 Yogananda Street

829
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:03,519
Nancy believe that the authorities that showed up at her door were either the FBI or CIA

830
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,615
Nancy had to convince the authorities that her son was just very intelligent

831
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,943
I was challenging self to see if he could hack into a government system

832
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
If you consider this an illogical picture of that full interview it's fairly clear that this was not a reliable assessment that Nancy was

833
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:24,255
Making then that's where the CIA comes from its Nancy saying that these people were CIA that showed up

834
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
What event that's described in this interview involves that friend leaving invitations to a dinner party and all the neighbors mail by

835
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,495
Nancy never rsvp'd so this person asked why

836
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,591
Nancy said it was closed because there was no return address on the envelope

837
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,639
She had thought there was a ax in it

838
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:46,015
This is what I was using as a foundation of his assertion that the CIA was involved in the Sandy Hook shooting

839
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:52,415
He's spinning conspiracy theories about the shooting wow Underoath in the deposition where he's being sued for things relay

840
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,231
Spinning of conspiracy theories about the shooting

841
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,767
Just seems like you can't stop

842
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,607
Like it's this I don't I don't even know why you would do this

843
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:07,007
That works in an argument setting like if you're arguing with somebody on a podcast or like

844
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,591
Piers Morgan or this is a great strategy to use but

845
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:16,991
I don't know about in court yeah I'm already at through the deposition as soap

846
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
So far I'm like okay

847
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,879
He is clearly established that learning is not a possibility

848
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,279
You know what I mean like it's not going to stop I think it's probably learning is counter to his business model and could probably would have been a

849
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
Maladaptive

850
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
Strategy

851
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Early on

852
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,495
Which to me says that if I'm if I'm like

853
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,263
Hey

854
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:43,615
Here's how we punish this guy if you wanted to stop

855
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
You have to bankrupt him

856
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,551
That's the reality of it cuz he's not going to stop he's or and if he's if he does stop for the Sandy Hook family

857
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:58,463
It's just going to go somewhere else and he's not going to learn from the behavior cuz in the depositions for the pager he's already lost

858
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:03,327
Yeah it does feel a bit like

859
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:14,847
That's that's your purse

860
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:21,247
Alex is pretty mad because he has been defaulted and he's lost these cases by default he believes

861
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,551
She's complied with everything

862
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:27,391
That's been requested of him course the little bit embarrassing

863
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
You repeatedly said

864
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
That

865
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Is court process

866
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Lawsuit

867
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
What just happened

868
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Is all a sham

869
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Because you turned everything over

870
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,471
Right

871
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,847
Yes I always Shroyer you never sent him one deposition one document request one thing

872
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,175
He was defaulted along with me and if that isn't

873
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Fraud the nothing is

874
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Is I need you to

875
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
You understand that you have some case there was a

876
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Court order

877
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Requiring

878
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Owen Shroyer

879
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:08,095
I know he appeared for a deposition yesterday asked you asked for it after the default

880
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Neurosurgeon

881
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
Do you understand there was an order

882
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
In August 31st

883
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Asking mr.

884
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Require

885
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
Owen Shroyer DePere for.

886
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,943
I don't know what you talk about yeah you didn't know that

887
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,247
So you got on your show without even knowing

888
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Discovery

889
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
Yasso big claims that I was making noise like complying with all this stuff when confronted with like this is something for

890
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,791
Do you know that

891
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
Nope don't know that say what I would have said which is just like

892
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:50,591
Really it's been going on that long how the time flies

893
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
Just stop and take a moment to appreciate where we've all

894
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
Got into let's just forget about this case friends

895
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:02,879
How many lawyers I've got to meet over the course of this thing

896
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:09,279
So many new friends the real default judgment was the friends we made along the way

897
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
I want to make one really important clarification

898
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
I've done a little AB

899
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,079
But the only things that I've cut out our when there'll be a call for an exhibit

900
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:28,479
And then there was a long stretch while the exhibit is being

901
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Pictures of like

902
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:35,647
For the sake of listening

903
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,207
Things that would provide greater context

904
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,743
Or

905
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,607
We do miss representation

906
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
I just want to do that whereas I usually don't be totally clear

907
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:57,407
So Alex has been confronted with the fact that in fact I get called for a deposition at

908
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:02,783
2018 and they just ignored ignored

909
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
So you got on your show without even knowing

910
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
What the discovery was

911
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
Did you know in mister mister

912
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,183
Mister posner's case in mrs. Delarosa

913
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
You understand there soon

914
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,839
I never said her name I never going to say I'm not asking you about what you said

915
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
Correct

916
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,055
Start their you know there's a lot I know I didn't get a hearing trial and I would judge that I was guilty I don't believe that I live in the Soviet Union

917
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Richard Jones you're not answering

918
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
You can goats in just a minute right now you're not answering

919
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,943
I'm asking you

920
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
Do you know

921
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
That Leonard Posner and Bernie Delarosa

922
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
You know they served

923
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Discovery

924
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,951
I believe so I guess you know you didn't answer it ever

925
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,839
That's not true

926
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,143
You're going to find out a lot of things you don't know

927
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,191
Itsannemoore

928
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,239
Not like you got a bad grade on your homework

929
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
Turn it in

930
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
You didn't know that

931
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,639
What were the depositions we had in all the 1,000 documents

932
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Definition

933
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,527
That's when we'll get to that let's talk about that in a minute but first

934
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,319
Mystikal mr. Posner mrs. Delarosa

935
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
You don't know

936
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,879
But you never answer

937
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
You don't even know that

938
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:21,887
In front of me a little bit of

939
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
Gaston and bravado once the actual like actual information is

940
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:34,687
IC IC Mark broke out his tap

941
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,295
Dancing shoes upon which to dance on Alex's grave I believe

942
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:45,695
I think I think you can tell there's a there's a tone of this is after the case is already

943
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,279
First time

944
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
And so

945
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
There is there is kind of a familiarity that maybe wouldn't be there in time the date

946
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,871
And so the list just goes on of stuff in Discovery that Alex claims

947
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,199
He did everything for but did not

948
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,015
You got Mission Posner mrs. Delarosa

949
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
Were you didn't even answer discovery

950
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,855
You got Mister Haslam defamation

951
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
We didn't show up for defamation

952
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
Answer any discovery

953
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Destroyer

954
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,535
You got mrs. Lewis case

955
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,815
David's

956
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
Senior lawyers

957
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Screwed it up

958
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
And you got Mister husband's ie

959
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,983
Would you just got sanctioned cuz you sent Rob due to the deposition you couldn't answer

960
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:34,591
In all of those things are true when you get onto your show and you tell the

961
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
Your show

962
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,967
But this is all just a kangaroo court and you completely comply but got real rooted

963
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
That's not true

964
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,647
Or you weren't

965
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,743
The way you wanted it and it should be on the issues of what did I say on here

966
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:58,143
It should be maybe Richard Delarosa

967
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Have the right

968
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Do you agree flutternut

969
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:10,431
I've been upset for the deposition you have not sat for a deposition

970
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
Mrs. Delarosa

971
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,783
And they have that right don't they

972
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:22,719
You really don't know yet probably a difficult question for Alex

973
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:29,119
Answer either in the affirmative or the negative questions

974
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,399
Doesn't want to answer

975
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,423
What are you

976
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,727
What a bad day

977
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,079
Especially in your deposition where you're f***** up

978
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
To have the lawyer remind you

979
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,783
You're not even a third of the way through the number of cases that you've ignored

980
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
Yeah it'll be challenging not only have you been getting enough in my class

981
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
Your other classes as well that you took previously

982
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,983
We went over there and if you'll recall there were a number of times where

983
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,127
Sourcing was discussed in a video or on his Show and Mark would ask

984
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,015
Where did you get that from Alex these cases with

985
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
I don't know but I could get it for you give me time I could get it for you

986
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
The circles back

987
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,999
Remember we talked about last deposition

988
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:28,767
About

989
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,815
The Bloomberg email

990
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,143
We're Bloomberg send an email out to his people

991
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,215
Say get ready in the next 24 hours is going to be a big

992
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
Remember that

993
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
That was a new story on

994
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,175
Yeah and then we talked about it for a while because you had brought that up to me you were like look I don't have the email itself

995
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:51,295
That was something I was reporting on I had there was a story about it and I was reporting on he remember that

996
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,343
And then you remember you told me you

997
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,695
Yeah I believe I said that and then you never gave it to me did you

998
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,047
I'd be honest with you back so you don't really have that much in my mind

999
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,863
Have much respect for any of this

1000
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,471
That you have respect for America I need

1001
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:18,431
Nailed it

1002
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,575
Give of that you don't have respect for the proceedings are going on your respect for America

1003
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,975
That was if you can't handle the truth will be delivered

1004
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:43,775
It would not be a classic movie Moana

1005
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:50,175
Electric

1006
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:56,063
That was pretty interesting that response I think was shocking

1007
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:05,279
It's just an outright combative miss that is it is fun it for the sake of a

1008
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:11,679
Podcast legal system

1009
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
Oppresses anybody really bad really really bad now we get to a discussion about

1010
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,639
Alex is audience size

1011
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,735
This this might have been a mistake on Alex's part

1012
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,783
I want to play you a piece of audio

1013
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
From from

1014
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Your radio show

1015
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
Videos

1016
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
This is going to be exhibit

1017
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:40,607
A revolutionary war 1776

1018
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,935
Audience

1019
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,495
10% of the United States

1020
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,823
10%

1021
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
That's true

1022
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Guesstimation

1023
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
I don't know

1024
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,279
You're the one

1025
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:14,655
It's a very short clip I need another context

1026
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
Uky the hurdle Club

1027
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
That's an advertisement for some sort of

1028
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
Pill or something

1029
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,079
I'm asking you right now

1030
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
Is 10% of America an accurate representation

1031
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
That's true right

1032
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
Major media

1033
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:39,231
I would say a large percentage of that agree with my worldview but I mean I would say 10% of countries

1034
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
Watch something I've done and agree with me

1035
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,071
And then globally

1036
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
Another 10% right

1037
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,423
Is your Infowars programming

1038
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,959
Is not bound by us

1039
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
It's the internet Tab

1040
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
You are right

1041
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,847
Interglobal

1042
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,223
Maybe 10% of the globe is listening into Infowars write imagine

1043
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
Temperature in people

1044
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Let that soak

1045
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,343
That's

1046
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,463
That's more hyperbole but the English-speaking world the outside

1047
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Whoa

1048
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:17,631
So this is a bit of a misstep I believe on Alex's fire because he's in a deposition where the goal is determining the damages

1049
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
He's going to be facing in this case

1050
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:25,311
What are the relevant questions when it comes to defamation particularly in a case like this where the defamation was broadcast

1051
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,639
Is that how many people were exposed to the defamatory material

1052
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:35,295
In the interest of his case should make Alex downplay the size of his audience but his ego won't allow it so he says

1053
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
Oh that 10% of the English-speaking world or about 135 million people are in his audience

1054
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:47,583
Essentially admitting would have been exposed to the things that he's being sued for which

1055
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,167
Is unclear if he even understood that in this question

1056
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,567
It's not like it was like Mark is clearly asking like these like you got a big. You got a big show big audience

1057
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,663
He's writing a puff piece about it so funny to me because

1058
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:07,807
It's from 4 I mean like I can see this perfectly just from Alex's tone of voice is just like

1059
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,879
This is a man who knows something's up

1060
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:17,023
You're saying all the right things to make me save the things that I want to say

1061
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
So these questions of like

1062
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:25,215
You got a big audience don't you Mr Jones even the way that at Marcus phrased it is of course Alex is going to say well yes

1063
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,871
My audience is huge you know he does smell a trap

1064
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Not well enough

1065
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,479
It's so funny to me

1066
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
It's so funny to me he thinks the Trap is coming but the Trap was already sprung my friend

1067
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
Lawyer is asking this question so like 80 in front of the jury

1068
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:55,167
I think he's a monster but he did

1069
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:01,567
And you got 135 million regular listeners what are you supposed to say take the time to ask this if it wasn't

1070
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:07,967
Part of something a point you're trying to build Alex's just helped that point get build

1071
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,247
Possibly build

1072
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:15,647
Through like just looking at web traffic or whatever Alex has done a great favor

1073
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:22,047
Would say establishing a self-reported audience size you can just feel how stupid he is

1074
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:28,447
Brutal so this is a particular highlight for me down for this because

1075
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,751
We've established there's this really large

1076
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:35,359
Mark wants to talk while again do you have a responsibility to not lie to your audience

1077
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
This is great

1078
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
Hyperbole something very familiar with

1079
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Yes

1080
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,503
Talk radio

1081
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Exactly

1082
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,087
When addressing.

1083
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Audience

1084
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
You're United States and Global audio

1085
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,511
Would you ever intentionally lie to them

1086
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,535
No

1087
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
Let me play another

1088
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,663
Like you really want

1089
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
Your back and forth

1090
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Stop. Org

1091
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
Faster.

1092
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,639
How many people View

1093
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Well I guess I guess we could

1094
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
Officially put it to bed. Technically probably kill the guy

1095
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:02,911
But he has not killed anybody

1096
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:09,311
That's such a great like little ping-pong Exchange

1097
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,711
Yes lion

1098
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:20,575
And every time every single time I answered a question and Mark said

1099
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,975
Let me play clip for you I'd throw the desk Alami like you win if you got it

1100
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,023
I think I think another response will be like

1101
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
Just sitting there like how am I going to say this is out of context

1102
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,519
Clear yellow something I stepped on a nail and then run

1103
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:46,175
So this is the point here in the in the deposition where we start to get around to some documents and some exhibits being interred

1104
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:51,807
And this one was a bit of a curveball

1105
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
This was a surprise

1106
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,415
It's fair to say that litter Posner in freezer

1107
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
Systems have had a nun

1108
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
No I am not number

1109
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,143
I don't really follow what he does so

1110
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
Can you do shows about them

1111
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Correct

1112
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,823
I mean I refresh my memory

1113
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
So

1114
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
I will refresh your memory about what you know of

1115
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
I'm saving boxes 25 you ever seen that before

1116
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
Not remember what is it

1117
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
You produced me

1118
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
Just a couple months ago

1119
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,591
In regard to Discovery request for documents

1120
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
SSO document

1121
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
That was in that folder

1122
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
That's it

1123
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,295
And that you agree with me a pierce

1124
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,575
To be a very large

1125
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
Text me about 187 page

1126
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,415
Comprehensive background report on

1127
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,183
Cosmo

1128
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,119
Oh I never ran a background report on Posner

1129
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
I understand that you probably

1130
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:17,311
Someone email is this and then we opened

1131
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:23,711
I did not know

1132
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:28,319
You just go through the email most of it even on open and just send you guys everything

1133
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,903
I would imagine what I've never run a background thing on buzzer

1134
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,767
One thing we can agree on because you look at the bottom of that document says fssp

1135
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
Tx-dot

1136
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
Five five

1137
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
44 correct

1138
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,911
That's a Bates numbers y'all use

1139
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
Give me documents

1140
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,031
Document right here came from Infowars corporate files

1141
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
I thought you said we were giving you any.

1142
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:58,015
Are you so we didn't get weird or default I gave you nothing you didn't respond

1143
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,831
Responsive to document

1144
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,927
But I'm just telling you I've never looked at the that's not what I'm asking you

1145
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,487
The news about

1146
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,559
Play in Florida doing a background check on him and so I figure

1147
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:17,215
My mother sent us this I'm just guessing

1148
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:23,615
I don't know what this is so let's not do that anymore I think they're on Alex's part 2

1149
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
Try and evade with the with the laugh

1150
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,599
I'm going to be a road that Alex is going to be able to go down I'm so instead

1151
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:38,463
He's like what I heard there's a guy in Florida that's obviously a reference to Wolfgang halbig

1152
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,863
To say his name and he's okay

1153
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,263
Remember this whole thing remember we got served in 2018

1154
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:57,663
I don't even remember this guy that's a strange

1155
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:02,271
This exchange cuz Alex he's actually confused by the presentation of this document

1156
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,415
And it's a gigantic and extensive background check on Leonard Posner one of the parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook

1157
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,767
The fact of free speech systems turn that over the cases bizarre

1158
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:17,375
The fact that was in their files to begin with his bizarre like all of it does not

1159
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:22,751
I suspect based on Alex's attempts to Workshop an explanation that one of two things is going on here

1160
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:28,127
Either he knew about this document and is surprised to see it so he's trying to come up with a cover story

1161
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,527
Or he had no idea about its existence but he realizes how f*****-up it is that that was in their files

1162
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,927
So he's trying to come up with a cover story for the unconvincing

1163
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Just left open for a jury to hear

1164
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,815
Without any explanation or exclamatory contacts on Alex's Park

1165
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,631
I don't think the existence of this document looks

1166
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:53,727
Good no no I mean I believe that Alex is never read

1167
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,335
187 pages

1168
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
I mean

1169
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
Of all the Epic

1170
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,503
They were going through the things they want to give

1171
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
Which

1172
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,391
Obviously we know excludes so many things

1173
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,463
And they were looking at the one violin

1174
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,255
Leonard Father's Day

1175
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
And they were like let's put this super suspicious massive background report that we totally didn't have ordered

1176
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:29,311
As for confused by its existence

1177
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,663
It states it's so bizarre and especially considering the things

1178
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:39,039
Now that's discussed about Alex and the publishing of

1179
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:42,879
Partners address

1180
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:46,975
Distance of this kind of

1181
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,047
Extremely thorough background report

1182
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,447
Is is not great one that has a lot of personal information about you

1183
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
You would you know if

1184
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,335
If I were somebody who had already had a default judgement against me

1185
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
In one case

1186
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
And then specifically

1187
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,455
Releasing it private

1188
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,039
Persons information was at fault in another case

1189
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,439
I would not want to have a big stack of that person's private information

1190
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
Opportunity

1191
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,911
Information well here's

1192
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Possibly have come from I just listened we walk down the streets and s*** falls from the sky

1193
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,527
But this is a nice little semantic game Alex tries to play about this

1194
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:48,159
One thing we can agree on is that in the files of free speech systems is 887 page

1195
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,719
Investigators comprehensive report on Leonard.

1196
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
What are you

1197
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
No no no no

1198
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:01,727
According to you I want your testimony before I don't care if I'm staying

1199
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
You put this is your base number on the bottom

1200
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,359
Correct yes okay this came from enforce corporate okay

1201
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,759
I think the fair is a good Dynamic going on where Alex keeps trying to get around things

1202
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:20,159
I think that Mark strategy is flexible enough that he can allow for Alex to say some b******* and then run into a wall

1203
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,463
With some of these deflection tactics

1204
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
I think it's very good think it's a lot of fun

1205
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:30,911
Yeah you really have to establish for awhile in advance that know Alex

1206
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
You sent this to us

1207
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:38,847
This is yours not mine I'm not making claims about it this is what you sent to us

1208
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:44,479
Sort of linguistic and rhetorical Dodges that he uses it as nature

1209
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:49,343
I'd imagine.

1210
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:55,743
Should have put a pin in them the message that I'm not going to put up with this

1211
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,303
Going to be a non effective and unsuccessful strategy

1212
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
And I think maybe how you have to talk to him a little parental book

1213
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Well

1214
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:12,383
If he didn't sound like he had failed a book report every time I answer to question maybe you wouldn't have to talk to him like a f****** joke

1215
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Perhaps

1216
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,807
So they they get into talking about the events where

1217
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,135
Letter Posner contacted Infowars

1218
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,183
With a polite complaint

1219
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
And then it went from there

1220
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
No Mister poisonous started in all of

1221
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,351
Privately complaining to you

1222
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,655
Infowars you agree with that he made a private

1223
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
Yes

1224
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,823
And he was very polite about it wasn't

1225
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,943
It's a long time since I saw the email that I think so

1226
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,223
Okay and

1227
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,759
When that didn't work

1228
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,063
He complained again but this time too you too

1229
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,343
You know about that

1230
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
I really don't remember you know mister

1231
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Right

1232
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,535
No

1233
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
November

1234
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,935
I remember people said he was going around getting lost of taking down all of them

1235
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
And and

1236
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
It made you mad didn't

1237
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
I told my crew members

1238
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,895
Sandy Hooks at our baby

1239
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Stop covering Buble

1240
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:24,831
Let's let's keep that one in my phone is okay I want that in the legal record

1241
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:31,231
For the rest of my life I want the legal system to know what I said

1242
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:36,607
But the way Alex answered that question is really puzzling to me is very confused

1243
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:41,215
First Keys aware that Mr Posner politely complain to Infowars and was ignored

1244
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:47,871
Then Alex is unaware that Posner went on to complain to YouTube but when confronted with how absurd that statement is

1245
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
Considering things he said publicly

1246
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:55,807
Alex tries to explain how he could be mad at Posner about Free Speech issues but somehow not aware that he could blame

1247
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,111
Alex and gotten the strike on his channel

1248
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:04,511
You can basically hear the gears moving here Rises Alex is trying to come up with a just plausible enough explanation for

1249
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:10,911
For all the details he thinks he has to account for like Ono the reason I did those shows was because I heard that he was getting

1250
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
Things taken down all over the place and was against Free Speech nothing to do with any personal interaction I had

1251
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,711
My Revenue stream being shut down eventually do to the germination of effort

1252
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:30,111

01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,839
This is just confusing this is this this answer is is Bazaar

1256
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,191
Long before you guys are assuming I would scream at people that they even talked about it

1257
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,727
Because it's Tar-Baby

1258
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,103
That's why I told you I just had to compartmentalize it out there because it's just like constant

1259
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:53,407
Imma Sandy Hook man I killed the kids

You guys used apply for me

1265
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,463
People think I killed the kids

1266
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
All the stuff just

1267
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
Do your worst

1268
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
What was my question

1269
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Answer your question

1270
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,887
He don't know what it was you were just talking

1271
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,471
Right now

1272
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
And so you just started talk

1273
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
You didn't even know what's up

1274
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:26,687
Do you want me to

1275
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
Sweetheart do you think you're at

1276
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:45,375
Regarding

1277
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:51,775
The YouTube complaint that made

1278
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:58,175
Is I killed the kids just

1279
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,991
To me that's the answer that question

1280
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,647
So this transitions Haram

1281
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:14,047
Posner to Albion questions about another parent

1282
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Jamaican Kelly

1283
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,119
Piece that I was so mad about

1284
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,167
Damn.

1285
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,471
Establishing question here

1286
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
When new husband

1287
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
Okay first of all you know who Neil house

1288
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Was right

1289
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Yes

1290
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,199
So when you hustled appeared on Megyn Kelly show in 2017 do you remember that

1291
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
Yes

1292
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,759
When he went on there

1293
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
And said he was upset

1294
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
By the things you were saying about saying

1295
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
You believe them

1296
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:49,631
I thought it was all done very theatrical and being a very canned way but I do think parents have pain over their children

1297
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,447
But it was all done and infomercial feel to it

1298
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,567
I don't care really what you think about Megyn Kelly or

1299
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,871
Nbcnews run by the largest

1300
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,151

The world you know like I do

1302
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Yes they make

1303
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,503
Incredibly edited

1304
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,527
Videos they

1305
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
It's a complete

1306
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,855
Mini p.m. sure if you've ever seen an embassy

1307
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Reproduction

1308
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
Lights in Carrollton

1309
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:16,511
Staging that I know that I know it looks like a

1310
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
I'm not asking about

1311
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
I just want to know about

1312
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
Did you believe

1313
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
Believe about what

1314
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,871
When he said he was upset

1315
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
You said about Sandy

1316
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,199
Yes I will

1317
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,551
I think a really good approach that Mark is taking with the questioning

1318
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,879
Where you getting out in front of Alex's criticism of the media

1319
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:49,535
Best deflect for taking responsibility for his actions is 2.2 other media entities and yell about the mistakes

1320
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,815
Mater how they're corrupt

1321
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:56,703
Introducing that on his own Mark is essentially taking that tool away or at least weakening its impact because

1322
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:03,103
If Alex tries to employ that Dodge the response he can clearly expected isn't that distracting argument but something like we're going to

1323
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:09,247
Agreement that the media isn't great but that's not relevant to the discussion we're having

1324
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:15,647
This is something that I think is a really good tactic you can use when you're talkin to hyper evasive people who are also full of s***

1325
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,743
If there's something that the standard rhetorical Refuge if they tend to take

1326
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:24,351
Staking out your wrong claiming that space makes it so they're less comfortable retreating to it

1327
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,167
And that's that's that's a good good ploy

1328
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:32,031
And at the same time you've resented this to being like did you believe

1329
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,591
No hassle in what he said this about his kid

1330
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,127
Because

1331
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
It's kind of relevant

1332
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
I will take you back to the night

1333
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,223
First all that Megan

1334
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Which

1335
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,367
Probably was a surprise for you considering that it was not what she

1336
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
Represent

1337
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
Correct

1338
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Yes

1339
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,767
And on that night when you saw that video

1340
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,815
You saw mr. housing saying though

1341
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
I want to take you back to

1342
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
That date

1343
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
And that date

1344
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
You understood

1345
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,775
Infowars two were to make a video

1346
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,591
Same Mister Haslam could not have held his

1347
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Sun

1348
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,639
That would be very

1349
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
You understand

1350
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
No I did not understand that

1351
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Okay

1352
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
This is bizarre

1353
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,415
Because he has said

1354
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:26,815
Already that he understood and believed on Megyn Kelly show

1355
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:31,423
He was upset by the things that enforces said

1356
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,031
But somehow now he's saying that he doesn't understand that saying more stuff

1357
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:42,431
What are human emotions contradiction that he's making

1358
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Not that is kind of bizarre

1359
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:48,831
Alex excuse me do you understand basic human empathy

1360
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
Just sauna

1361
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:57,279
Well after the Megyn Kelly peace Owen Shroyer

1362
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:01,375
Story where he

1363
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,935
Yes I recall which is part of the lawsuit

1364
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,287
We want to know why did he do that

1365
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,895
Who who gave him the the idea to do that do you feel about it now

1366
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
Who

1367
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,223
Do you know sitting here today

1368
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,503
Who made the choice

1369
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
For Owen Shroyer to put those

1370
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Claims by

1371
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,111
On the air about Neil

1372
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
Interview

1373
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
Do you know who did that

1374
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:30,047
It was a live show that's that she's not a video we made it was a live show

1375
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,863
Ali Reza zerohedge article he just read an article

1376
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,167
Jim Fetzer

1377
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Remember that

1378
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
I believe he was in the article

1379
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
And you understand that a video was made for that and uploaded to YouTube

1380
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
Would you have any reason to

1381
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
I'm not sure we would have her YouTube

1382
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,975
You also know that a month

1383
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
After mister

1384
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
Destroyer made that

1385
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,327
Video using took that 5 minute video

1386
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
From the live show

1387
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
And played it on your show

1388
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,567
I'm at my PS I guess I got

1389
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,592
So

1390
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640
Whose decision was it

1391
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
If you know

1392
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,456
For him to

1393
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,504
Basically give more air to mister pets

1394
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Those islands decision

1395
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:31,232
My friend

1396
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:34,560
Yeah that's

1397
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:39,168
No it still doesn't excuse Alex's re-airing of the video

1398
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,728
That was your choice

1399
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:48,128
Based based on what Alex's just said yes Owen obviously has control over his own show

1400
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:51,456
It's a live show he chose to do that

1401
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,552
That means that Alex having the same control over him

1402
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:02,464
You would assume that chose to are the exact same information on his show I'll look I don't

1403
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,840
Time for those kinds of little decisions

1404
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,936
There's a rebuttal to this in a follow-up question that

1405
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:17,568
Mark may have some information that runs counter to to this thing that I look the same

1406
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,896
I talked to him a couple days ago

1407
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
And he said no he didn't

1408
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,992
Read it at all word look at research

1409
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
Somebody put in front of him

1410
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,064
He doesn't member who

1411
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
But he doesn't

1412
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
You didn't do that

1413
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Mini doesn't research

1414
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Somebody puts it

1415
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:41,888
Your phone's going to be doing that video that didn't agree with us okay

1416
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:47,264
Bread so this? Moses brings up a point to put the Alex in a really uncomfortable position

1417
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,664
Give me the impression to be that Infowars reporters are all in-depth researchers who bring their own work to the show and deliver

1418
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,688
More hard news

1419
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,808
It looks like journalists kind of

1420
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:05,952
The problem however is that

1421
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:11,840
He was just reading an article someone put in front of him with no awareness of what the article was or what the sources were

1422
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:15,424
Position of having to claim that Owen lied

1423
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:22,080
This is likely because the alternative open the can of worms that Alex does not want to have opened to the public

1424
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
The question

1425
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
Who put the article in front of Owen

1426
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:32,576
If isn't lying then someone in that studio has a shocking level of editorial control over what goes on on the show

1427
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,392
And we have no idea who that person might be

1428
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:42,048
You can see how this question alone could lead to some discomfort because if such a person exists you have to ask yourself how did they get the

1429
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:45,632
Editorial Authority is that part of their job description

1430
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:50,496
What kind of digging do they do into the sources that they are providing for the anchors to just say on air

1431
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:57,152
On the flip side of this it open opens up a question about who can and just tell Owen what to say

1432
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Say on air

1433
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:02,528
If a person who fed him the story with someone like a boom mic operator then that raises the question

1434
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:07,392
Can anyone just put something in front of Owen and he'll read it on air is the news

1435
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:13,792
That's that's troubling the Anchorman Ron Burgundy territory

1436
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,352
Option under the bus

1437
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:22,240
The other option involves the possibility of some undisclosed editorial manager given Owen the story to report

1438
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:28,128
Or the possibility of a complete negligence and lack of oversight about everything they put on the air to the point where

1439
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:33,760
Any person who's there buses brake Screech so loud

1440
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,856
I just had to stop for some reason I don't know what could have

1441
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:43,232
It's strange it's understand the Instinct that Alex has

1442
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:47,840
But yeah this this point that Mark brings up of

1443
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,888
The conversations he's had with Owen Wright

1444
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:55,264
And it's it is very counter these are doing a counter either

1445
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,664
Bus metaphor two buses heading for an intersection

1446
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,504
Other under both are being driven by Keanu Reeves in speed

1447
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,904
What I eat what I find interesting about the shofar and

1448
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
Really what is going to

1449
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,256
Do Alex and

1450
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
Five more than anything else is that

1451
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,400
Alex is ability to understand questions is so shallow

1452
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,496
That he doesn't realize that by answering one of Mark's questions

1453
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:32,128
He is then raising the possibility that more questions will be asked like he doesn't

1454
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:38,528
Get that he believes that the answer is the end of the question that's probably because he's used to monologuing what I'm saying and then

1455
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,928
Also having interviews with Gaston his conspirators Coke collaborators with him

1456
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:51,328
So this is a completely new concept to him that the answer is also a consequence

1457
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:57,728
Leads to more question Rapaport whenever a follow-up

1458
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:04,128
Why can't I have a deposition with John Rappaport I answered one question why are you asking more questions about that

1459
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,528
When I have conversations

1460
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:16,928
Alex Alex has to really put his foot down and make clear that like no one runs his own show

1461
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,000
So the only two people in the room

1462
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,840
We're probably going to have any influence on what goes in front of the anchors

1463
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
Say

1464
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,632
The producer

1465
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
And the person was researching checking

1466
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,728
Right

1467
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,520
Know them know the way

1468
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,056
The way it works is the host

1469
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,616
. is telling me what the plan what articles

1470
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,712
Owen should have been the one who found

1471
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:44,576
That's what you're thinking that's how it would normally work he would have found that article hundreds

1472
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,904
Hundreds of articles

1473
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,488
Then that is why I do it this way

1474
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,536
Imoan basically

1475
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,816
Rooster Booker everything

1476
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,656
So the way I sit there and I print hundreds of articles

1477
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
Well ride direct people to

1478
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,008
I just say go to these 10 sites and print everything

1479
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,800
Okapi

1480
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
And then

1481
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,384
Other people there and chosen to do it the same way

1482
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,920
Anna just constantly

1483
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,480
More information coming out as the day goes on

1484
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:19,392
Talking parrots eating amount like throwing 90% of 7 ft in front of that assistant

1485
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:26,048
But that the radio host run the show it's a radio show on TV

1486
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
If a radio show

1487
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
It's not journalism it it's not you

1488
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,472
In the main if it's just like Howard Stern

1489
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,520
Or it's just like Rush Limbaugh

1490
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,592
And you're playing Clips recovering articles are giving your opinion

1491
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,640
Okay. Journalism

1492
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:50,112
So I may I agree it's a radio show on TV ironically it is neither of those things

1493
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,976
Sure it's a roundabout extremists Topix

1494
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,936
Embark wants to establish that this information that Alex is using in the

1495
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:10,080
17 videos that he put out to people like Jim Fetzer

1496
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:16,480
And whether or not at that time he had reason to believe that Jim Fetzer was not a good source

1497
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,528
Back in 2017

1498
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
You had information

1499
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
Routine information

1500
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,440
That caused you

1501
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,000
Weather mr. Houston

1502
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
Correct

1503
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,912
Yes I did I did see an article questioning it

1504
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,192
Information

1505
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
That information was raised

1506
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
My mister

1507
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
Correct

1508
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,432
I don't I don't have no iPhone

1509
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,480
2017

1510
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Infowars

1511
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,064
The company itself

1512
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
And understand

1513
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,416
That there was issues

1514
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
With mr. feathers credibility

1515
01:27:59,232 --> 01:27:59,744
Correct

1516
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
Direction form

1517
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
I mean I can't really speak too much because your credibility

1518
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,984
So this is a trap

1519
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:16,384
Obviously the question being asked

1520
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:22,784
The answer is in the question of

1521
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:29,952
Just jump at their information is also more or less a statement that like

1522
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,768
Do you have any reasons to doubt his credibility

1523
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,328
And of course there's an email

1524
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,608
I mean I can't really speak to

1525
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,424
Other people in your company

1526
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
To you

1527
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Correct

1528
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
I don't recall

1529
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
You're a couple watching talking about jump

1530
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
No

1531
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
If somebody

1532
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,344
Call Watson in 20

1533
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:58,880
15

1534
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,928
Lyrics Chief reporter by then

1535
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Did editor what is he

1536
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,376
Decided self

1537
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,680
He also did some hosting

1538
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,960
Yes

1539
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,568
Is mr. Watson let's just say again

1540
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
That Mr Watson

1541
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,152
Somebody whose opinion nearest

1542
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Somebody you will If he if he brings you something you'll listen

1543
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Right

1544
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,344
May not always agree

1545
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
Yes

1546
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,232
Mr. Watson had come to you

1547
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,584
And told you

1548
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,120
Alex

1549
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,936
Confessors batshit crazy

1550
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
Would you listen to him

1551
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,032
Taking that into consideration

1552
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
Yes

1553
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:54,432
This is I think this could not be more like a fork

1554
01:29:54,688 --> 01:30:00,832
In chess you know like when you've got your night in the right spot and you're listen I'm getting your queen or I'm getting your

1555
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:07,488
So how do you want this to go and Alex does not understand what's about to happen to him

1556
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:13,888
The email of other people

1557
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:20,288
Buckley is on Alex's is hearing this and now

1558
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:26,688
Not realizing that was about to happen is exactly the thing that I mean this is amazing

1559
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,992
I want the hammer to drop

1560
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:32,832
My friend this frog is boiling formation that called into doubt

1561
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
Mr. Fetters credibility

1562
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,184
You would check in and verify that before ever relying on

1563
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,584
I can't talk about the hypotheticals again

1564
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,984
Discussing already told you that ninety-eight percent of all we do is covered news in the public domain

1565
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,264
Opinion

1566
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,312
And so I'm not

1567
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,360
A journalist Wall Street Journal

1568
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,432
One year-long investigative

1569
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
Journalist

1570
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,528
So I'm a radio talk show host

1571
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
The put the show on TV

1572
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,464
This whole thing that he's doing with like I'm just a talk show host I think it just feels like a you wouldn't hit a guy

1573
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:16,864
Glasses

1574
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,960
Over here I'm not causing such nonsense I mean like

1575
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:26,592
He's also trying to prevent this idea of like everything we cover is just like mainstream Media stuff

1576
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:32,992
Like he pretends that he has high-level secret sources and you constantly taking primary source.

1577
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:39,392
Events are coming up with fantasy interpretations of them regularly conducted those softball interviews of dangerous

1578
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:46,048
I have a lot of the time he's even reporting stuff based on fake stories from his past or esoteric dreams that he came

1579
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:50,144
Prophetic we can't blame him for that

1580
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,192
Until we know he's not a psychic

1581
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
Okay we can't prove that yet

1582
01:31:54,496 --> 01:32:00,640
So I'm going to go ahead and air on the side of where I'm at

1583
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:07,040
Doesn't necessarily come down about this email from Paul but we know that it exists

1584
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:11,136
Need to bring it out now because you have Alex always listening

1585
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,304
Old grump David Knight

1586
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
David Knight is a

1587
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960

1588
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,752
Easy work for you right now

1589
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
He did work for you

1590
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Yes

1591
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
When did he leave

1592
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Remember correctly about your ago

1593
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:37,760
And then he's not come back anyway or y'all still doing videos with

1594
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
No

1595
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
David Knight

1596
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
Did not

1597
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840

David Knighton

1600
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,664
Steve pieczenik did not get along

1601
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,016
I guess

1602
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,576
Big night

1603
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
Incredibly critic

1604
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Nothing Steve

1605
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,648
China Cuisine

1606
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,464
No I don't know where that

1607
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
Can you tell me what David Knight isn't worth

1608
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
The company anymore

1609
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:29,216
David was saying that he was being censored and no one was sent to him and he was just unhappy

1610
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
And

1611
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:37,920
Alright

1612
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:44,320
Made some comments about tactics and strategies to use an appositive

1613
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
I do have to clarify that

1614
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:49,440
Mark has a slightly incorrect piece of information that he's putting out here

1615
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:56,096
David Knight was totally into what Steve was saying about Sandy Hook still promoting the Sandy Hook was fake on his show and tell

1616
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,376
At least 2017

1617
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,216
David got sick of Steve when he said that the Las Vegas shooting was fake

1618
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,032
And that led to the deterioration of their working relationship

1619
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:09,664
I meant David got really mad when Steve started coming back on the show around the lead-up to the 2020 election

1620
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:15,552
David was insistent that Steve was a con man and the stuff about all the balance beam watermarked blockchain was stupid

1621
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:21,952
Timothy was just lying to Alex this is getting fired and replaced by Harrison Smith hosting the American Journal

1622
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:26,304
Truth to the tension between the two of them

1623
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:32,704
But David night actually was totally fine with this

1624
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,984
Damning for David Knight

1625
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:40,640
Sure Alex is like being censored

1626
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:45,760
Was a lying piece of s***

1627
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:52,160
You wanted anyone until I fired so now we learn a little bit about David nights

1628
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
Actions

1629
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:58,048
Hook timing this is weird

1630
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,840
Confronted with a marker

1631
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,608
7

1632
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,728
No one will notice about this document as you look down in the bottom corners there's no numbers

1633
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Bottom corner

1634
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,568
Blank page

1635
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640

01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
Former lawyer

1637
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,456
Database

1638
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
So I don't have an ID

1639
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
But looking at this email

1640
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,856

1641
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,624

That's one of your employees

1643
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Yes

1644
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
And

1645
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,048
I'm going to go ahead and read this for you here this is

1646
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:30,816
The date

1647

June 19th

1648
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,120
2017

1649
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,496
You remember that the Megyn Kelly and

1650
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
Right

1651
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,080
Yes

1652
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
In fact

1653
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
One of the videos that your company is being sued for

1654
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,944
June 26th

1655
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,088
Yes and then in July you also

1656
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,112
A video about these

1657
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,648
As well correct

1658
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,696
Baby bean soup

1659
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,720
I don't know

1660
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
Yes

1661
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,792
Doing updates so you do know you didn't make that Delights

1662
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
You know that sitting

1663
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,216
The shop

1664
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
Video

1665
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,592
Well I guess you didn't make the video but somebody did

1666
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,384
Somebody made a video of that

1667
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
Uploaded it to the

1668
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,016
What I'm trying to get cuz you've you brought the

1669
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
What is distinction of a

1670
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,552
A couple times

1671
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,368
That nowhere just a live radio show it's not a video

1672
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,696
But there are videos and they're uploaded to YouTube

1673
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
Correct

1674
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:35,072
For the radio show

1675
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,376
Could be totally different than who's watching you

1676
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,192
Correct

1677
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:43,776
So now we have this video we have this email from David Knight

1678
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,312
And it's from David Knight

1679
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,080
To David

1680
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
Rent

1681
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,664
So sending himself something

1682
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
Guess

1683
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
The subject line

1684
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,576
Is it says Connecticut carry

1685
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,344
Releases

1686
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,624
The troubled past

1687
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
Of Neil Hess

1688
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:00,672
And then do you see

1689
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,952
There is a link there

1690
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,232
From ammoland

1691
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Dot-com

1692
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Correct

1693
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,048
Yes

1694
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,120
And then it says sent for my iPad

1695
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:09,888
Right

1696
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
Okay and then

1697
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,776
This email here was sent to himself at 6:12

1698
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
You see that yes

1699
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,640
Everything I said about this emails accurate

1700
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,920
You have any reason to think that

1701
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,480
This is not a true and accurate email from Infowars is 5

1702
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:30,880
I don't know I don't know either you gave it to me and it don't even know

1703
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,648
Reason to dispute this

1704
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,440
No I don't have any bruises good

1705
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,768
So we we've got this established it's David night

1706
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:40,096
Around the time of the Sandy Kelly interview

1707
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:43,936
At 6 p.m. was emailing himself and article

1708
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,984
How is dirt on me last one

1709
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
Now

1710
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,824
Interview are

1711
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,616
But there's more

1712
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,408
Let me show you this Tuesday

1713
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
Similar email without Marxism

1714
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,064
You see this is 6:18 2017

1715
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
Yes.

1716
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
I'm just a couple days

1717
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,696
Before Owen Shroyer

1718
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,720
Video

1719
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:09,792
Correct

1720
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:10,816
Yes

1721
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,120
And you remember that Megyn Kelly

1722
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
Interview

1723
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
Your profile came out in

1724
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
In June 19th

1725
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
2017

1726
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,848
So here we have Again David Knight

1727
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,896
Send an email to himself David Knight

1728
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,968
Speak the truth 80 at Yahoo is that another one

1729
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
Gmail address

1730
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:29,760
I don't know

1731
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:30,784
You'll never

1732
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
No

1733
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,112
It says subject

1734
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,904
Neil heslin father of Sandy

1735
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Criminal charge

1736
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:38,976
News

1737
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
And then there's a country

1738
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
Oracle link

1739
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
Yes

1740
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
Himself

1741
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,448
Set himself this email

1742
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
At 2:56

1743
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,240
6 in the morning

1744
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
You're any reason

1745
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
But this isn't

1746
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:02,784
I think this is a good strategy that's being employed here because there's no question for Alex to answer

1747
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,184
Other than just like be a reason to believe this is an authentic

1748
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,208
Or to spend anyting

1749
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,232
There's almost

1750
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,144
Definitely no information that Alex could give about these emails that would be useful but letting them just sit there

1751
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,240
There there's clear indications that senior employees

1752
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:28,640
Everything that they could used to smear hassling at 2 a.m. or 2:50 something a.m.

1753
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,712
6 p.m.

1754
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:39,648
Almost like it was his job for the day it's such a bad look almost as if somebody had directed him to find

1755
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:46,048
Information on Neal hesler been up all night working so hard on it and then later

1756
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:52,448
People use that information burning the midnight oil

1757
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:58,848
It gives an indication of a kind of vibe baby there was going on

1758
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
How did Ford's play I want this

1759
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:06,016
So because there's I don't know maybe the appearance of like

1760
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:12,416
Looking for ways to attack this person who is in the Megyn Kelly interview seemed like maybe threatening to Alex

1761
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:18,816
This is an important question which is like do you have any reason to believe that these people were faking

1762
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,584
Their grief

1763
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,400
Does the company have any reason to contend

1764
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,424
Call first let me ask you

1765
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
Do you

1766
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,984
Have any reason to

1767
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,776
The any of these parents

1768
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
Faking their Des

1769
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568
Stress over it

1770
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,480
I did not kill their children

1771
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
And

1772
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,856
I didn't visit out of my angel's house CIA

1773
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
And no one sued me

1774
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,256
Back the time and I was actually talking about it was once I became extremely famous

1775
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,816
Hillary Clinton issue about in campaign ads

1776
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,608
And then Trump won the election

1777
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,960
And then I became this big supercharged political Target is low-hanging fruit

1778
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:00,288
Nnnn nnnn I got always the Sandy Hook man

1779
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:03,360
And then and then they leave the DVD

1780
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
Gun control groups

1781
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,176
The Democratic Party

1782
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,200
Basically

1783
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,736
Attach themselves to me

1784
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:12,320
So that every time I was in the news they could then bring backup settings

1785
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,368
But for the gun control advocacy that they have

1786
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,416
Natural this long process

1787
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,208
Has as head has been

1788
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
First of all Jackson non-response

1789
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
Was any of that

1790
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,864
Was any of that meant to be a reason that you can't end

1791
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:31,520
Where to send Michael a faking faking their distress

1792
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,824
So they're just stress over what you said

1793
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,360
You admit that

1794
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,248
Then then that distress

1795
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,296
I think I think when

1796
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
Since you can understand how

1797
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,368
When new husband

1798
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,648
I spent the last

1799
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,208
Heroic child

1800
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
Looking him in the

1801
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
I didn't kill him

1802
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
I know you didn't

1803
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,632
Please let him just ask you

1804
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,704
I know I've got my client

1805
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:07,104
You're not

1806
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,128
Can you kill these kids

1807
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
Nobody's saying that you

1808
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
You caused that grief

1809
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
Let's make that really clear

1810
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
Nobody's saying that

1811
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
Parents the word grieving over the death of

1812
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,344
Their children that's the thing that they went through

1813
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,624
Has nothing to do with you

1814
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,392
You get that

1815
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:26,560
Their grief over the death of their children has nothing to do with you you get that accept them for the gun-control though that it was projected on

1816
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,840
Blaming us for their gas

1817
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:29,120
And we don't accept that

1818
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,912
I don't even know what that means

1819
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:37,824
You asked me a question every time some crazy person on Prozac

1820
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,384
Doesn't kills people at the CIA went visiting on record

1821
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:44,224
And then we get blamed and we're tired of being blamed

1822
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:50,624
You can almost hear Alex starting to turn into like show mode here almost here that's flip gets wet

1823
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:58,560
Because there is a guy I guess I'm going to go out now or I guess I'm going to get really combative do a performance

1824
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:03,168
I was in reaction to him being forced to say yes that is you know

1825
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,728
Once he got that negative

1826
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:06,752
The that

1827
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,056
That terrible headspace of just having to say

1828
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:14,944
Yes I know what you're saying when he couldn't deflect on anything right so then it just turned into him being like

1829
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:21,344
There's only one way for me to take control of this again it's in response to the

1830
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:27,744
The like the other objection non-responsive it's like I'm not even getting gate with this

1831
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,352
You're going down

1832
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:39,520
Listen I'll take care of my client the f*** you are yeah

1833
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:45,920
This is a does not Barney

1834
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:51,040
Text clip Alex and he

1835
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,856
It's unfortunate what happens when you get to the show mode

1836
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,392
In The Wrong settings

1837
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,672
So here's the deal

1838
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,696
Here's the deal

1839
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,744
The court of public opinion

1840
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,304
Knows that people have a right to ask question

1841
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:07,680
Now in high side I saw the families it look pretty legitimate some of the nominees are not to not be true

1842
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,472
And then I said I was sorry

1843
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
And then I got sued

1844
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,800
And she looks just a sitter and pretend

1845
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:17,664
That Alex Jones in red pajamas like the devil running around attacking all these people and that's not the case

1846
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Let's see the people

1847
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
New Hustle

1848
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,760
20 / 2

1849
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
Cherish memory

1850
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Putting his hand through

1851
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,672
Mistress Troyer

1852
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Menu

1853
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,000
Get on TV

1854
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,048
Andros curious doubt

1855
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,608
About whether even held his son

1856
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Whether he's telling the

1857
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Truth

1858
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,472
Any did that after he had asked you to

1859
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,240
Stop

1860
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,008
You can under

1861
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,288
And why that man might

1862
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:49,664
And you can understand how he's on TV on an actual program attacking us

1863
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,200
Yeah you know why you did that

1864
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,992
Tell me why do you do that

1865
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,808
Because Megan Kelly went to organize the whole thing for publicity

1866
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:00,928
Contixo go after the Second Amendment they used for political purposes

1867
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:04,256
American people and then get surprised with people

1868
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,072
Think it might be stage might be might be sympathetic

1869
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,096
You think Neal Hustler

1870
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
When on National Television

1871
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,168
To ask you to

1872
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
Stop

1873
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,216
As part of a pot

1874
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:21,920
There are the interest behind it and the money and and end of the financing

1875
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,968
I don't represent any of those

1876
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,016
I don't represent Megyn Kelly

1877
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:29,856
Add Megyn Kelly in this chair right now believe me let me talk another something

1878
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:34,976
So now Alex has gotten himself into a strange position where

1879
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,816
He's trying to claim that these people were doing these the sort of

1880
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:42,400
Pageants to das Amendment and

1881
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:48,800
It's fun when you're on a radio show and you can drive

1882
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:55,200
Specifics of like we talked about my client here

1883
01:45:55,456 --> 01:46:00,064
Alright having to dance around all these things and asked like to be specific is like

1884
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,880
Kryptonite for allergy and you can see that

1885
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:09,024
Almond and he tries to continue to justify a lot of his behavior because

1886
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,560
Have a notion that

1887
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,840
The Sandy Hook

1888
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:16,448
Parents got political share and that made it so he had to fight them right

1889
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,728
Do you

1890
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,752
Have any reason to

1891
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,800
That these parents

1892
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,824
Grieving process

1893
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
8:30

1894
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Husband impact

1895
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:34,112
That's a hypothetical question I can't speak to their emotions

1896
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,904
There's nothing

1897
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,464
I did not kill their children

1898
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,768
They became political and used

1899
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
That deaf

1900
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,352
To them for their advocacy against the right

1901
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
Bear arms

1902
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,168
And so that directly put them in

1903
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
Opposition

1904
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,264
Politically with me

1905
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,824
So they stepped into that political Arena

1906
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,848
What what did

1907
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
Do politically

1908
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,504
Did you ever say anything about guns

1909
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,856
I'm talking about

1910
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:06,880
Nicole Sandy Hook

1911
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,672
Situation in general Bandit some of the

1912
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,976
Look at it did start Louis

1913
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,048
I don't have it all in front of me

1914
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,352
That's such an illustrative moment

1915
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:22,752
Alex is trying to come up with a justification for his actions because he's being confronted with the reality that he traumatized

1916
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:28,640
In the place he decides to land that they use their children stats for political gain against the Second Amendment

1917
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:35,296
Marks were bottle is so revealing because Alex can't name a single thing that these two people who are suing Alex ever did

1918
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,832
Advocacy

1919
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:40,160
He has no idea what these people did or didn't do

1920
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:45,792
His response was just the normal kind of Dodge you'll use when he's being questioned by some s*** head like Rogan

1921
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,608
Who does go along with whatever Alex says

1922
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,912
Here's why this is key to understand

1923
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:57,568
Alex didn't say or do the things he did about the particular parents who were suing him because they were in opposition to the Second Amendment

1924
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:04,224
What happened was that Alex saw the conversation surrounding Sandy Hook shooting their hit being a threat to his gun

1925
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,552
So he decided that the Sandy Hook parents

1926
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,856
Which he needed to attack to change the narrative

1927
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:16,512
Really care about any of them or what they were doing or not doing individually he saw the collection of families

1928
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:22,912
He's as an entity he could attack and paid his coming after the Second Amendment and portraying them as being actors is a really easy

1929
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,216
Midway to invalidate them to his audience

1930
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:31,872
Maybe some of the parents of gun-related activism so to Alex that means they all were and they were you

1931
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,664
Using the shooting to push their agenda

1932
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,016
To undermine what he perceived as them use in the shooting for political game

1933
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:41,856
Alex attacked individual parents cuz he felt that by doing so

1934
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:45,696
He was in validating the group as a whole and protecting the Second Amendment

1935
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,744
Right it's pretty clear

1936
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,144
Based on the way he's describing his thought I thought pattern and this is when I would go back to the earlier question

1937
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,424
About Neil heslin

1938
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:02,080
When he was on Megyn Kelly and Mark really forced Alex to get to this place of like yes I do

1939
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
If

1940
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:06,176
I mean he's a human being

1941
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:09,504
If your son is died and you hold him that I get that that would hurt

1942
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,784
I get that

1943
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:17,184
And then even then he can try and justify his behavior after that but once you've established that he can look at it

1944
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,720
Another human being and say yes

1945
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:25,120
My actions hurt you that is under underlying all of these justification you got to have to go back to

1946
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:31,520
You like just most Elementary let's get agreement about air

1947
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:34,592
But you know you hurt

1948
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:37,152
You can understand that

1949
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:40,224
Until then whatever justification you have

1950
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:46,880
Is still undercut by the fact that you know that you hurt them right but I think even in that case even with that

1951
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:53,280
That established Alex could still Retreat to the idea that hurting them is an unfortunate byproduct of defending the second

1952
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:59,680
Sure he could probably justify that in his own head it doesn't sound good

1953
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:04,288
We're well in far beyond anything sound

1954
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:10,688
That train has left the station this seems to be a bit of a pattern of behavior

1955
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:14,784
That Alex has

1956
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,088
And this is where

1957
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,392
Really was

1958
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:23,744
Like this is where I think turned and I was really shocked that this was happening

1959
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,280
So we know in 2012

1960
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,304
Right wouldn't happen

1961
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:28,864
You got on TV and started talking about it being

1962
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,656
We know that

1963
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,960
Soon the rapper I had Quest

1964
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,800
No new mr. Jones I don't understand this whole thing about questions I don't get

1965
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,336
If you say Sandy Hook

1966
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,616
Fake that's not a question

1967
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
That was

1968
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:46,016
That was years later I can see how people think it's absolutely fake

1969
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,552
There's no code of you saying I can

1970
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:48,832
People spend

1971
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
You keep repeating that it does

1972
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:54,976
Okay well that's what I remembered our last deposition I showed you clip a clip of you saying

1973
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
Totally synthetic

1974
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
We made up with actors

1975
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,328
At first I thought they killed real kids

1976
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
They didn't

1977
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,912
But that's that's that's that's

1978
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,448
That was

1979
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:06,240
And you did that

1980
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,264
In 2014

1981
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,848
He did it he didn't 2013 you didn't 2014 you didn't

1982
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,616
2015

1983
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
Correct

1984
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:19,808
I got to go back and look but I definitely said that I had serious questions about it

1985
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,368
Could see out they will see it was stage with all the

1986
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,392
Bizarreness

1987
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,696
Michigan

1988
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,280
Sandy Hook

1989
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,120
God it's weird look at this

1990
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:36,704
Somebody needs to answer

1991
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,240
You wouldn't be here today

1992
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,056
The reason to

1993
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,336
Statements that I want to talk

1994
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
As you admit

1995
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,896
That over those five

1996
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,968
Without equivocation

1997
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,504
Fake

1998
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
Children did

1999
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,040
Die

2000
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,064
Actors

2001
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,600
Parts of differ

2002
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:55,904
You said those things

2003
01:51:56,672 --> 01:52:02,816
Can you know just admit that for the jury that you said they're going to see the videos can you build a Sandy Hook them self

2004
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,608
Wild

2005
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,504
Yeah I couldn't believe my ears within this goes on

2006
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:25,344
Can you know just admit that for the jury that you said they're going to see the video

2007
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,160
Sandy Hook

2008
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,720
They should look into it themselves

2009
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,280
And see why people ask questions

2010
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,632
No I really hope

2011
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:42,496
I feel like Alex is really deeply implying fit

2012
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:46,848
He is right it was right about it being fake

2013
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:53,248
I think he's absolutely contending that it is still fake such a bizarre thing but you can tell if you're watching

2014
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:57,600
We're listening to it even you can tell that it is

2015
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:04,000
Sort of visceral response anger behind

2016
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,048
Like

2017
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:09,632
Like it because I think it's largely motivated by

2018
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:16,032
So many attempts of deflection and stitches not really working out

2019
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:20,640
That's maybe the value in soda cutting off exits and like okay

2020
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,968
Now you've nowhere to go other than you now we're going to

2021
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:30,368
I mean you also have to cut off the physical exit Financial exits as well as

2022
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:34,720
We've had to cut off a lot of exits to get to a place where Alex is here

2023
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:41,376
True that Outburst enjoy that like

2024
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:47,776
You're afraid that they're going to look into this I hope I hope your bananas man

2025
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:52,896
Navigate to some more emails and one of the what about her email

2026
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:03,392
Turns out we're talk about some emails that have to do with Jim Fetzer

2027
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:06,976
Before we broke we had talked about weather

2028
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:09,024
Infowars head ever

2029
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,816

2032

2033
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,008
Not my memory

2034
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,592

2036
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:34,112
She has no memory of promoting sensors.

2037
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,904
I want to start at the bottom

2038
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,440
Without pausing though

2039
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,000
And he says Rob Jim Fetzer

2040
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024

Amazon

2043
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,144

2044
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:46,912
Handle it

2045
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:47,936
Jim wittig

On the phone

2048
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,384

Still running

2056
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,632
You flip over

2057
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,776
The next message

2058
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:27,360
Okay before we going to gym Festus message you know Jeffrey

Do you remember Paul rent the Paul Watson also

2061
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,480
The same time that he told you

2062
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Crazy that

2063
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:37,856
No

2064
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:40,160
Going up to Jim Fetters email

2065
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,440
Identifies himself

2066
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
But he says

2067
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:47,328
Rob

2068
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,888
We are making the book available to the public

2069
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,424
Free here's the covering

2070
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:55,520
PDF several sites are now offering it I would be glad if we're Alex

2071
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:58,336
The same I'm sure James would be glad

2072
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,360
You come on with me

2073
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,128
If Alex won

2074
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,408
Interview is about

2075
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,176
The stunning of

2076
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,712
I think the latest

2077
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,480
Case was

2078
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,504
Pentagon pay

2079
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
I read that correctly

2080
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
Yes

2081
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,856
And then Rob Do-Right's back to

2082
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,624
Jim Fetzer

2083
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,416
Says thanks for the heads up

01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,464
Sent the links to at dawn

2086
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,048
Please let us know if

2087
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
If there is a bump

In download

2089
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,608
Rob

2090
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,400
Diary. Coronavirus

2091
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:28,800

2092
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:35,200
Maybe you can dance around like we get a lot of emails

2093
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:41,600
Rob is Robert is riding back hey I sent this on to add on Salazar's

2096
01:56:54,912 --> 01:57:01,056
To them I would expect to be in the f****** case has very least you're admitting at least accurate

2097
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:07,456
Pasadena-based interest in how things go look

2098
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:13,856
Cuz if you're not curious just like you be interested you're curious to see if you should do

2099
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:19,488
Do-it-yourself Oregon if this is something that people are interested in

2100
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:23,584
Will you give me market resistor tracks are audio

2101
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:29,984
Information is largely was behind the zerohedge article

2102
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,032
In the video that ended up

2103
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:38,432
Bobbing party this lawsuit point about this actual zerohedge article

2104
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,968
Seems to be missed

2105
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,784
Then you recognize.

2106
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,208
Yes

2107
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
Zerohedge article

2108
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,120
You know why it might be relevant to this lawsuit

2109
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:59,936
This is the article I was reading that

2110
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,728
He's been sued for and the

2111
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,544
Cobra jacket with Owen

2112
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,712
Has big blank space in the middle of the page

2113
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:14,528
Seems to be awake printed from the internet

2114
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,832
Blow that big Blank Space

2115
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,624
Do you see where it says except this.

2116
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,648
Does not comport with

2117
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,672
Social story

2118
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,208
Just forgot

2119
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:22,976
And then it says

2120
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:24,256
Jim Fetzer

2121
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
Professor emeritus

2122
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:26,304
At the University

2123
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,072
Give Minnesota

2124
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,096
Who wrote a book

2125
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,120
Cleaning Sandy Hook

2126
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,144
Stage

2127
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:30,912
Notes that be

2128
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
The facts of the case

2129
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,728
Haslam statement

2130
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,008
Behold his son

2131
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,544
With a bullet hole through his head

2132
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,824
Could not have half

2133
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,200
I want you to flip to the 3rd pick

2134
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,784
You see that first sentence

2135
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,344
The first paragraph there it's

2136
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,368
Just one long sentence

2137
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:54,976
Okay and what how that paragraph begins is by saying

2138
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,512
It's entirely possible

2139
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,608
You see where it says that

2140
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,400
That wasn't said by info

2141
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:11,360
Here's the problem with their shoddy strategy of never

2142
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:17,760
The things that the actual article that they're getting sued over actually

2143
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:24,160
Says in it that a maybe he did for his son

2144
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:28,000
Is that just to justify position of he couldn't evolve

2145
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:34,400
So one way makes money in the other one doesn't I feel like we both know which way works

2146
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:40,800
Yep that's that's an unfortunate thing to have to

2147
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:47,200
Would end and this might be the crazy thing for me right but if I had spent my entire career not reading things

2148
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:52,576
And then suddenly was starting to be told more and more

2149
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:57,184
Terrifyingly that the lawsuits weren't going well I would take

2150
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,488
And maybe a whole week

2151
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:02,816
To just really read through everything that I'm supposed to know about

2152
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:06,656
Be surprised when I was in a deposition

2153
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:11,264
And maybe I wouldn't get caught in some of these f****** traps you don't want to have a

2154
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,544
Sort of consistency

2155
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,592
Heavy breath of grief

2156
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:17,664
Oh no

2157
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:24,064
Deflation is not a ongoing thing you want to feel you want to be deflated and then done you know what

2158
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:30,464
Constantly keep going your your response to seeing something that is really unfortunate and damning

2159
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:36,864
Shouldn't be oh no not again

2160
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:43,264
You just put those needles in me so the idea about his relationship with Jim Fetzer

2161
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,616
Like he didn't trust him as a source

2162
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:52,480
Even before hallway the 2017 still getting Sudan

2163
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:54,528
It's at this is weird

2164
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,576
Okay I'll show you what if Martha is

2165
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
At 11

2166
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,464
And I know that this has a really like

2167
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:03,744
I have a lot of stuff

2168
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:10,912
The only thing I think when we get into this.

2169
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,960
Quickly discover that it may not be

2170
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,728
Necessary

2171
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:14,752
Read all of this.

2172
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,544
But if so I may need to give you some

2173
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,384
What I want to ask you about the

2174
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,152
Document

2175
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,712
Up at the very top

2176
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,016
You see that this is an email

2177
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:28,320
29

2178
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,088
2018

2179
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,648
About a month after you were

2180
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
You understand that

2181
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,256
Peddlernet

2182
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,536
What is Nico's job title

2183
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:39,840
Okay and then

2184
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:41,120
Daria what's her title

2185
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,400
She was

2186
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,936
Sound operator then

2187
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,984
Sedation

2188
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:48,032
Yes

2189
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:50,080
And so Daria sending this to Nico

2190
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,104
In the subject is

2191
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:51,872
Forward

2192
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:53,152
Vanishing blog

2193
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,432
Not only is

2194
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
Noah Pozner

2195
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:56,480
Fiction

2196
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
What is Fatherland

2197
02:01:59,296 --> 02:01:59,808
Have you ever seen

2198
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,600
No

2199
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,880
Auto Pagani.

2200
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:13,120
Maybe I should talk about it

2201
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
Right after you

2202
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,544
I mean

2203
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,848
No I've no idea

2204
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:28,992
I find this

2205
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:30,272
Tubi

2206
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,552
Very surprising

2207
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:38,208
Because I mean revelatory it is revelatory

2208
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:40,000
More surprising to me is that

2209
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:46,656
It appears as though he still thinks he's out of chance you know it really feels like the way he's too

2210
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
Talkin he's like

2211
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:54,080
Okay maybe I lost on this question maybe I'm losing on this one but next one maybe there's that glitter glue

2212
02:02:54,336 --> 02:03:00,480
Camera light I can sneak through operated

2213
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:06,880
I was in this deposition I'll be like literally everything I say you're going to have a clip for so f****** say whatever you

2214
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:08,928
You want to say here's my answer to your question

2215
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:15,328
Yes or no whatever you want I will just say I don't know over and over again and then we'll go home

2216
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:21,728
Bull run up run out the clock on this thing you one man

2217
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:22,496
Yeah

2218
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:28,896
So of course they're more documents and shifting now over into the Wolfgang

2219
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,712
How big section of of some of these documents

2220
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:38,368
And Mark brings up this email this email is

2221
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,928
And I believe

2222
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:46,304
That's some of the goal of this is just make Alex recognize like

2223
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,840
Add source

2224
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:50,400
We should be trusted

2225
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,960
Little bit about Wolfgang halbig

2226
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,264
You know what I mean when I talk about this

2227
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,032
Super Bowl picture

2228
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,080
No

2229
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:01,152
You know what I mean about the Superbowl choir

2230
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:01,920
A fourth grader

2231
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,992
Yes I've heard of that okay

2232
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:08,064
And that's when I really started thinking it probably did happen if I can just get to

2233
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:11,136
Crazy that's what happened

2234
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:14,976
I'm sure you would have marked as exhibit 12

2235
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:20,096
You'll see again at the bottom there's no base

2236
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,448
This one

2237
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,752
Is dated 1190

2238
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,776
18 2016

2239
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:31,616
I wasn't going to hear the end of 2016

2240
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,152
It is from Wolfgang halbig

2241
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:37,504
To line the main people it sent to

2242
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:39,552
Include Nico

2243
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:43,392
Then

2244
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:46,464
Several organs

2245
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,256
Correct

2246
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,048
Just robbed you

2247
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,072
He was also another

2248
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:51,840
Employee

2249
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,888
And then Jay rinsed

2250
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,656
You think you're being fair

2251
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:59,520
And then also copied there's a cc line

2252
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,800
And there's several other people

2253
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824
Kopyor

2254
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:02,848
Either

2255
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
Media organizations and there's also

2256
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:06,944
Government address

2257
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:08,736
Yes

2258
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:12,064
Also a bunch of

2259
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:13,344
You see that

2260
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,416
I never attachments

2261
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,696
Appear to be PNG

2262
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:19,488
Images

2263
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,560
And then the subject line

2264
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,840
Says Trust

2265
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:25,376
But always verify

2266
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,168
Please verify with your

2267
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:27,936
Uncle

2268
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:28,960
Thanks

2269
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:29,728
You see that

2270
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:34,336
Yes I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you alright

2271
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,616
Rob

2272
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:38,944
Please send this video to your uncle the former FBI

2273
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,480
Pretended my Connecticut

2274
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,760
Freedom of Information

2275
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
Hartford Connecticut

2276
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:45,600
He told me that I was right about

2277
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
About what would happen

2278
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Gave me a

2279
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
More courage

2280
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:49,952
He has friends you can

2281
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:51,488
Verify this video to be actor

2282
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,024
And now we know the

2283
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:53,792
Let the children

2284
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:55,328
Supposedly died at Sandy Hook

2285
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,120
Or at the Super Bowl

2286
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:58,912
On February 3rd 2013

2287
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:01,216
And that is why we have never ever heard

2288
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,288
Think about it for just a second

2289
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,592
They sing before 110 million

2290
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
People worldwide

2291
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,384
Jennifer Hudson

2292
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:12,992
They have 87,000 people in the stadium if over 3,500 news report

2293
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:16,064
And we never have one interview in the newspaper of

2294
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,088
On television

2295
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,368
From them why

2296
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,672
Just think about how much money came

2297
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:22,720
I'm flowing in after that February 3rd

2298
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,488
2013

2299
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:24,512
Super Bowl performance

2300
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,792
Across the world

2301
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:29,120
Why have they never performed again if they were so great

2302
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:29,888
To be asked to sing

2303
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:30,912
February 3rd

2304
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:35,520
Wino appearances on the national early morning television

2305
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,336
They sing before 110 million

2306
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
Simply disappear

2307
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,408
Even Beyonce

2308
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,712
Where are they are they all dead

2309
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:47,552
Threatened by the NFL and CBS Sports

2310
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:51,136
And by their own parents never to talk about the greatest day in their lives

2311
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,160
Are they part of

2312
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:53,440
Child trafficking

2313
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,464
Who would do this

2314
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,536
The fourth grade children when we all know that children need to ask

2315
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:59,072
Express their feelings or emotions

2316
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:01,120
Where can I have long-term mental health in

2317
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,912
The blood that is a YouTuber

2318
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:05,984
And then it says please have your uncle verify and

2319
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:06,752
And tell me

2320
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:08,032
That I am not crazy

2321
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,056
Because I

2322
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:11,616
Because I have now run out of funds

2323
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:12,640
Chasing the truth

2324
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:13,664
Please help

2325
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,736
If you can afford it Wolfgang housing and then he gives his address

2326
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,272
Correct

2327
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,064
I've read all that correct

2328
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,112
When he asked them

2329
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:24,160
To verify that he is not crazy

2330
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,696
That's not something that

2331
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:31,840
That is what I really started thinking that it probably did happen one

2332
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:33,376
Thanks ducks eat oranges

2333
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:35,168
Tonight

2334
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:39,264
But I'm not the progenitor of this

2335
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,104
That is I'm not saying this

2336
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,640
You have to understand that wolf

2337
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:53,344
Yes when he first came out to livestream on national TV that's why I was relying on him

2338
02:07:55,136 --> 02:08:01,280
So this is an important foundation here that's being built through this email because it kind of boxes Alex in and honestly he

2339
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:02,304
Did it to himself

2340
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:08,704
Because he's getting presented with a clearly insane email that how big sent Rob do trying to reach Rob's uncle

2341
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:15,104
It's not coming from a credible person but he also

2342
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,920
How big is a credible Source prior to this

2343
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:24,320
That's why Alex tries to use this excuse that it was actually decided that how big wasn't a good source

2344
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,856
Kennedy shouldn't listen to him

2345
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:32,512
This is a really dumb piece of information to Alex OfferUp essentially unprompted because what does it put the

2346
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:38,144
Deadline on the point where you yourself are admitting you had no reason to take this person's claim seriously

2347
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:44,544
Yeah this is basically creating an unanswerable question for Alex if you can demonstrate that he took how big's claims

2348
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:50,176
Seriously at any point after this and that's a real problem for Alex's appearance of consistency

2349
02:08:50,688 --> 02:08:56,832
Double-edged sword because Alex is also essentially testifying that the things that how big did orseund Infowars

2350
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,600
Prior to this

2351
02:08:57,856 --> 02:09:00,160
We're not enough to get him to think that how big was.

2352
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,952
And shouldn't be trusted as a source

2353
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:06,816
Remember the day this was November 19th 2016 was when this happened

2354
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:11,680
Yeah I mean that's what that's one where you really that's it that's an own-goal

2355
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:15,520
That should be that's on Alex right there cuz the moment you are like

2356
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:18,336
Given the opportunity to have a date

2357
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:24,992
Stamp on something you think and you're Alex don't do that about a good idea

2358
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:31,392
I think we talked about it like specificity is a real Danger

2359
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:35,488
Whether it's email or this time

2360
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:41,888
This story was being pushed by how big is too specific for you to be able to play games with you can

2361
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,448
Which again if I'm doing this

2362
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:51,104
I would say look into when I actually started listening to how big and when I stop stop

2363
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,688
Talking about how big you might not want to do that it was real bad

2364
02:09:54,944 --> 02:10:01,088
Not agree to a date prior to the end of when I started talking about how what's fascinating about it

2365
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:05,184
Music you listen to it or something

2366
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:12,096
That is not a question that Mark asked him at all which is why I'll amazing

2367
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:18,496
Over here because the last clip in the next one

2368
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:22,080
Because it's not really relevant to some of the questions we have

2369
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:28,480
A consists of Mark and Alex discussing how the alternative media is really important in the country because the corporate media isn't really something

2370
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,784
We can trust to get us out of the mess we're in

2371
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:37,184
Mark keeps trying to work on in a recognition that it's important for the alternative media to hold themselves responsible

2372
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,328
When I get things wrong and Alex just goes off but I was the victim of the mainstream media is out to crush all at alternative media

2373
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:48,192
It's a bit circular thing but it seems like the goal is to try and attempt to build some rapport

2374
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:52,544
Effective possibly confusing Alex and getting him off his set

2375
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,896
And it also makes it so the kinds of rebuttals can't really be used effectively

2376
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:03,296
Alex can't excuse his behavior by condemning the mainstream media is marking to say you're telling me man but that's not what

2377
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,064
Talk about

2378
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,880
Does it get just sort of creating that

2379
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:13,280
That's a camarada real most interesting that Alex is so

2380
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:14,816
Such a weird dude

2381
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:17,632
That you can play both good cop and bad cop

2382
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,424
In the same deposition

2383
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,216
You do like he's he's

2384
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:25,056
He's f****** pinned Alex's ears to the wall

2385
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:30,944
And and he still and Alex's still like you don't like the mainstream media me neither man

2386
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:37,600
I think we got a lot of it is weird to hear like there's a bit of guard letting down

2387
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:41,952
For your benefit

2388
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:46,048
F****** railroad spikes through the Stigmata bed your f***

2389
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:52,192
There's a bit of that and then another email from Wolfgang halbig is brought up

2390
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:53,728
I want to show you this

2391
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:55,520

Europe

2398
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:12,416
It is from Wolfgang halbig right

2399
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,768
To a couple email addresses that I bet you don't

2400
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:20,608
Another

2401
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:24,192
Yeah the one safe and sound schools.org have you ever heard

2402
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:26,240
Not my memory

2403
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:31,360
I'm going to assume though that you see the address

2404
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:33,152
Is is written to somebody named Michelle

2405
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,176
Yes I got

2406
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:35,456
And then

2407
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:37,248
The subject line is

2408
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,784
Irons Michelle

2409
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,552
You stopped using

2410
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,088
Josephine and making money

2411
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,136
Speaking engagement

2412
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:45,440
You saw that

2413
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,488
Yes

2414
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:48,768
December 21st 2040

2415
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,352
At the bottom

2416
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,376
Document

2417
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,192
Glad yes

2418
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:58,496
Attachment Theory see a bunch of PNG

2419
02:12:59,264 --> 02:12:59,776
That's correct

2420
02:13:01,312 --> 02:13:02,336
I'm going to go ahead and read the email to

2421
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,104
Are you all right

2422
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:09,504
This is another email somehow big and you'll notice that this one's dated prior to the one about the Superbowl choir which is

2423
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:12,576
Where Alex is claimed to be realize how big is no good

2424
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:18,976
So this email was an Infowars corporate files which itself is weird because no one seems to be copied on this email at

2425
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:19,744
Itself

2426
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:26,144
His existence of the files implies an awareness of its contents sent it wasn't emailed to them

2427
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:31,776
Yeah so this wasn't good enough to get how they blacklisted and this is a mess

2428
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,312
I'm going to go ahead and read it

2429
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
You all right

2430
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,128
Michelle

2431
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:40,992
How could you and your husband as responsible parents even allow your precious child Joseph

2432
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:42,016
Hoping to attend.

2433
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,552

This school has has you must have known

2436
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:51,232
Is and was a toxic waste dump

2437
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,000
As reported by

Lead paint

2445
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:01,728
High levels of asbestos

2446
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,520
And especially the high levels of

2447
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,056
Pcps in the groundwater

2448
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,080

Out-of-state

2450
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,664
Josephine your child should have expected more

2451
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:10,688
Before that tried

2452
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:11,456
Saturday is a pear

2453
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,736
You are supposed to

Why would you as a parent and all those other parent

Mysterious toxic waste

Deplorable conditions when you went

2468
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:34,752
To that school

2469
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:35,776
Are you blind

2470
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,080
I do not understand unless you ask

You have all these experts on your staff who are now part of your conspiracy

2494
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:21,344
Filthy and deplorable school with all that toxic

2495
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,648
We call this child in danger

2496
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,184
When you know the danger.

2497
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,464
Expose your child to

2498
02:15:26,720 --> 02:15:27,488
Serious lifelong

2499
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:30,304
You must have known without a doubt

2500
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:32,864
Pictures do not and it says Ally but ugly

2501
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:38,240
You put her life in serious risk everyday

2502
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:40,800
Knowing how filthy and deplorable that school is

2503
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:42,080
I am enclosing

2504
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:43,616
Photos that you must recognize

2505
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
You took your child

2506
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:47,968
School and having a child and special needs you expect

2507
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:48,992
The school environment

2508
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:50,016
School climate

2509
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,808
That allows children to learn in

2510
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:53,600
Right

2511
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,880
Please explain to me if you

2512
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,648
Can wise

2513
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,184
School principal Dawn hops

2514
02:15:57,696 --> 02:16:00,256
Would allow our school to be so filthy and deplorable.

2515
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:04,352
There is not one female Elementary School principal in this country

2516
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:07,168
Deplorable

2517
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:08,704
Inside and outside

2518
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,520
Most of all allow her to become a toxic waste dump

2519
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:15,872
Placing every child in her work on brevity

2520
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,640
Right

2521
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,664
All the picture

2522
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:19,200
Taken by the major crimes

2523
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,272
Please respond since

2524
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,552
The expert

2525
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,344
Wolfgang's

2526
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,136
WWE

2527
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,672
Sandy Hook

2528
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:29,696
Dot-com

2529
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,720
I read that correctly

2530
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,488
Yes

2531
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,512
How you feel

2532
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,792
Horrible

2533
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:36,096
I never seen this before

2534
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:45,312
We had it

2535
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,592
That's all

2536
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:49,408
Do you know

2537
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:54,784
This is an email where how big is harassing and terrorizing the Sandy Hook family

2538
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,160
This is before the play where Alex said he realized how big was Bad News Bears looks bad

2539
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:05,792
And see if some of these groups are a little bit longer wear marks reading these emails and I think it's important because

2540
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:12,192
It honestly was kind of a revelation for me to be understood that no how big was

2541
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:16,800
Characterize this way the contents of these emails

2542
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:19,360
And it really it really did make me

2543
02:17:19,616 --> 02:17:25,760
More seriously or anything cuz I already felt this was pretty serious.

2544
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:32,928
Good personal space Park way more visceral and the actual Behavior

2545
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:39,328
Is that he's contacting these family members into the things that he's doing it simultaneously to the time when Alex's promo

2546
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:40,864
Loading him

2547
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,168
It sucked it really just gets

2548
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:48,032
Pretty inexcusable new rule for my life

2549
02:17:48,288 --> 02:17:49,056
Beaches that

2550
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:51,104
I don't want to be around people

2551
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:52,128
Who

2552
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:55,968
If I were to have their emails read to me in a deposition

2553
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,248
Are both

2554
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:03,648
So awful I would have to sigh and put my head in my hand but also so long that I have

2555
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:08,768
Have to do it multiple times the other a bunch of most like

2556
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:15,424
You think you could not get more opportunities for one man to say oppa

2557
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:21,824
Oh that was a bad one there's more

2558
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:26,688
I guess what there's another email

2559
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,760
Michigan Marshals exhibit 14

2560
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:33,856
You see if the top is another email from Wolfgang halbig

2561
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:37,696
Yes right this one

2562
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:41,536
You see about right here

2563
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,936
And so you see on your document to you

2564
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,216
Enforce email address

2565
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:53,056
Yes that would be robbed you and Nico who's email

2566
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,104
This was

2567
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,408
March 21st 2017

2568
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,968
Got the subject was

2569
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,528
Anyone needing the address for a visit

2570
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,320
To welcome them to Florida

2571
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:06,624
Please call and this was a great day

2572
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,440
Who says that you cannot catch a big fish

2573
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,720
In Florida

2574
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,256
Subject line says

2575
02:19:13,024 --> 02:19:15,072
Just forgotten there's a PNG attached to

2576
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:19,424
Is that correct

2577
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:21,728
And then I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you

2578
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:26,592
Here we have another email from how big and the date on this one is March 21st 2017

2579
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:32,736
The timeline this is supposed to be after he realized that how big was not a good source

2580
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:39,392
Possibly a Content warning this email is very disturbing I don't want to just spring this on people

2581
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:45,536
Without a little bit of a heads up explicit

2582
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:48,096
And then I'm going to go ahead and read this email to you

2583
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:52,192
It says Nick and Laura Phelps did a great job at

2584
02:19:52,448 --> 02:19:53,472
Newtown on

2585
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:55,776
Newtown Connecticut on December 14th

2586
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:56,544
2012

2587
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:58,592
I visited their own today

2588
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:02,944
At 1924 Westover Reserve Boulevard Windermere Florida

2589
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,224
3478

2590
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,784
And thanks to Lieutenant van Gailey

2591
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:10,112
Telling me during my wellness check of Nick and Laura Phelps

2592
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:12,672
That they no longer live in Newtown Connecticut

2593
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:14,208
And that they are no

2594
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:16,256
And they are now Richard and Jennifer

2595
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,048
Guess what

2596
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,584
He is totally right

2597
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,632
And can you believe it that my Newtown Police

2598
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:23,424
Department guided me in the right direction

2599
02:20:24,192 --> 02:20:24,704
They have a

2600
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
Beautiful home

2601
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,264
Three car garage

2602
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,824
They were not home today

2603
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,104
But the good news was that

2604
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,896
Female moms

2605
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
Your children standing outside their homes

2606
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,712
Observe me

2607
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:36,992
Wanted to know what I

2608
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:41,344
It was spring break it is spring break for Orange County Florida

2609
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,368
Preschool children

2610
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:46,208
I showed them this picture and I told them that I did not want to go to the wrong house

2611
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:48,768
Surprise nickandmore up for Newtown Connecticut

2612
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:50,304
AKA Richard and

2613
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:51,328
Jennifer Sexton

2614
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:54,144
I took a few minutes for them to look at the

2615
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:54,912
The pictures

2616
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:56,448
And then when they ask why I wanted to

2617
02:20:57,472 --> 02:21:00,544
I told them that I had been in Newtown and wanted to surprise them

2618
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:01,568
Open a living for

2619
02:21:02,592 --> 02:21:05,152
They asked for my name which I gave them is Wolfgang how big

2620
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,736
They told me how I would know them knew them and I told them if they had

2621
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:11,296
They have been on the national news

2622
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:12,064
So I wanted to

2623
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:12,832
Miguel

2624
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,648
Our conversation was all about Newtown Connecticut

2625
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:17,952
So she said do you mind if I text

2626
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:19,744
I said absolutely not

2627
02:21:20,512 --> 02:21:23,584
Waited about 10 minutes only to learn that they did not know me

2628
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:24,608
Surprise me

2629
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:26,144
They verified the

2630
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:27,424
Pictures and why would she

2631
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,216
Text them about Newtown Connecticut

2632
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:31,008
And that someone from there once

2633
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:31,776
Open to visit

2634
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:34,592
If they hadn't if they were not Nick and Laura Phelps

2635
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:35,872
Richard and Jen

2636
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:38,944
At first I did not went to interest

2637
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,480
What is a gated community

2638
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,248
But several

2639
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,016
People told me to

2640
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:43,552
Just go on in there there was no such

2641
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,320
Security guard at the

2642
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:45,856
If there is

2643
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:47,136
CTV they will see

2644
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:50,720
Being told to go in and that is the only reason or I would not have

2645
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:53,280
Now who says law enforcement

2646
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:56,864
Thank-you Newtown Connecticut

2647
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,632
Police Department

2648
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:59,168
You turn the document over

2649
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:03,264
First of all read that email correctly

2650
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:04,800
And then on the back

2651
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:05,568
There's a picture

2652
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:08,896
At the top it says Sandy Hook hoax

2653
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,176
Correct

2654
02:22:10,688 --> 02:22:12,736
Yes it has arrows pointing to the Phelps

2655
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:15,552
At the bottom it says playing the part of

2656
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:18,368
Yes

2657
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,136
Horrible email

2658
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:22,976
I never seen this email and it's

2659
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:28,608
Yes I don't like this email and again this is someone else will King how big

2660
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:31,168
After I'd already clearly know that he cracked hub

2661
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:33,216
So that's that's that's not my work

2662
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:39,616
Sucks dude bragging about stocking grieving families and that's unbelievable

2663
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:46,016
Joe Pathak f****** serial killer that's a serial killer that should be treated with the same level

2664
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:50,112
True Crime Tavarez a serial killer

2665
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:56,512
It's hard to imagine something more unsettling in the context of

2666
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:02,912
Like what Wolfgang could have been doing like most true crime documentaries the cops are the bad guy

2667
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:09,312
Guys I don't know how much you take

2668
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:13,920
You can see Alex essentially taking the bait that he set for himself

2669
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:20,320
He's established that he knew how big was no good after the Superbowl thing in 2016 and then after that now this is

2670
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:26,720
This email is

2671
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:32,096
He would but like I said this is a trap that I'll accept by giving a pretty specific time.

2672
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:38,496
When he has no excuse to not know that how big is it reliable and this immediately becomes a problem

2673
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:43,104
Yes I don't like this email and again this is someone else will King how big

2674
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,408
After I'd already clearly know that he crap table

2675
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,456
So that's that's that's not my work

2676
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,224
Next month

2677
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:50,528
Ur22 video called Sandy Hook vampires

2678
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:53,600
Someone

2679
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:55,904
I've seen that

2680
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:57,952
And during that video you repeat it all

2681
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:06,144
I don't remember

2682
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,424
But I believe it was about

2683
02:24:08,192 --> 02:24:09,216
People using it

2684
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:11,520
Continue to try to get gun control in money

2685
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:17,664
So yeah we have we have a demonstration

2686
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
After this

2687
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:22,272
Even though all this to your timeline doesn't make sense

2688
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:25,344
Even after all this b******* that stocking a family's

2689
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:29,952
Email the core fighting emails being sent to Miko and Rob like

2690
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:32,768
After

2691
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:38,144
The 2016 point when you had every reason to doubt his credibility as an expert

2692
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:43,008
You're still repeating his things in the Sandy Hook vampires video believe he

2693
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:43,776
That's

2694
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,312
That's just dumb

2695
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:46,848
In every direction

2696
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:53,504
All the time it makes it so much easier 2.2 like okay so it's not supposed to trust him

2697
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,576
Give me that that like

2698
02:24:56,832 --> 02:25:00,672
Tiny glimmer of hope of of just like now you know I haven't seen the video

2699
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:01,440
Dude

2700
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:08,096
We're at our whenever of this if he says he's got a video of you saying it and you have

2701
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:09,120
Haven't seen the video

2702
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:15,520
Click youcanplayit anytime man it's here I don't know I haven't seen the video

2703
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:21,408
Is only going to get you out of answering this question now it's not a good answer. Good excuse

2704
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:28,064
God damn it I mean I'm not even associate

2705
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:31,648
Did with him and I'm making the sounds that Alex is making

2706
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,440
Michigan

2707
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:38,304
At the bottom you see it says FSX

2708
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:39,328
TX

2709
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:40,864
Dash 04

2710
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:44,192
0027 corporate files

2711
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,472
Just got

2712
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:47,520
The top it says Wolfgang halbig

2713
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,568
Right that's what's from

2714
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,384
Okay it says to Wild Rose farm 1740

2715
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,152
Gmail.com

2716
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:54,432
Do you know who that is

2717
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:59,040
The subject line

2718
02:25:59,296 --> 02:25:59,808
Says

2719
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:01,344
How could you as a mother

2720
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:04,160
Stop and buy your special brand of coffee on

2721
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:05,184
1/14

2722
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,208
B12

2723
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:08,256
When you heard as a mom that shot him

2724
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,024
Fired

2725
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,304
School

2726
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:11,840
You read that correctly

2727
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:13,888
Yes this is a March temp

2728
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
Email

2729
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:16,448
Correct

2730
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,496
He says in this email

2731
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:19,264
Scarlet

2732
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,312
It is just a matter of time

2733
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:24,128
And all that money you have has to be returned

2734
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,664
How could you even stopped

2735
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:26,688
To buy your coffee

2736
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:28,736
And you bought coffee for two other people

2737
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:32,832
What kind of mother does that especially when you see on the news

2738
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:35,904
Tell everyone how you ran across that fire

2739
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:36,672
Parking lot

2740
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:37,952
If you did

2741
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:39,488
You would have spilled the coffee

2742
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,792
Do some serious soul-searching

2743
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,584
Does the scam is up

2744
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:44,608
Wolfgang

2745
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:45,376
Phone number

2746
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:46,912
I read that correctly

2747
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:48,960
So at least end

2748
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:52,800
Infowars had in its corporate employees had received information

2749
02:26:53,312 --> 02:26:54,080
How big was harassing

2750
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:55,360
Track

2751
02:26:56,896 --> 02:27:01,248
We get millions of emails I've never I never seen those up until the time of these lawsuits

2752
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:06,112
Understand all I'm asking is

2753
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,392
Infowars received

2754
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:09,184
Yes

2755
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:14,048
Another email where how big is harassing the families of Sandy Hook victims

2756
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:17,632
Being Incorporated

2757
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:23,264
From March 10th 2015 Richard Pryor to dispose cut off of Alex thinking how big is credible

2758
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:29,664
The picture starts to come into focus a little bit where you at how big demonstrating a pattern of behavior

2759
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:36,064
Reason to know about giving their access to these emails news director for the Nightly News being copy

2760
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:42,464
Almost all of them also this doesn't come up in the deposition but Wolfgang how big was a guest on Alex

2761
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:45,024
It's a show on March 4th 2015

2762
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,608
Just six days before he wrote this email harassing Scarlett Lewis

2763
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,888
And like

2764
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:52,960
It's not hard to put some pieces together of

2765
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:55,520
Wolfgang is on Alex's show

2766
02:27:55,776 --> 02:27:58,080
The website is website

2767
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:00,640
It's conceivable that donations are

2768
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:06,784
Are accrued by his appearance on here two days later he's engaging in this Behavior we're here asses

2769
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:08,832
Grieving parents it's it's disgusting

2770
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:15,232
Yeah yeah if I'm Alex in this situation I hear those three emails and I immediately switched actor

2771
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,256
Texan I just go

2772
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,792
A real piece of s***

2773
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:24,192
We got to go get him and then I grab everybody and we go to Newtown Connecticut or whatever you need to go in Texas

2774
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:30,592
Let's go see Mark you're deputized

2775
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:36,736
I do this everybody has guns now cuz I'ma get my horse

2776
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:42,624
Jesus what a piece of s***

2777
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,160
F***** up f******

2778
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:44,928
Wow

2779
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:45,952
Yeah

2780
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:48,512
It's also

2781
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:54,912
Interesting to recognize that these evasions of I didn't know about this stuff no

2782
02:28:55,168 --> 02:29:00,032
No one knew about this stuff we get so many emails it just doesn't really fly

2783
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,336
I wish we would have marked as exhibit

2784
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,456
UCF football team is fsse

2785
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:08,736
TX.

2786
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:10,272
0398

2787
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,808
897

2788
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:14,880
This is a 2015 email sent March 6th

2789
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:15,648
2015

2790
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:16,928
Yes

2791
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,976
And this is

2792
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,768
The top email is

2793
02:29:21,024 --> 02:29:21,536
Nico

2794
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:22,560
Forwarding something

2795
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,352
Direct

2796
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:25,888
And it says forward

2797
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,680
Distance from a third-year lost

2798
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:30,240
And then it says

2799
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:32,800
Some comments on how big's last interview

2800
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:33,824
Prolost

2801
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:39,456
From a gentleman Neymar Darin from

2802
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,760
It was sent to me.

2803
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:42,528
Your contacts

2804
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:45,344
He writes

2805
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:47,904
Two cents from a third-year lost

2806
02:29:48,416 --> 02:29:49,184
Madam or sir

2807
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:51,488
I'm in my final semester of Law School

2808
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:56,096
I listen to the Wolfgang halbig video and some significant alarm Bells went off

2809
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:59,424
I also wrote on the YouTube page but I copy and paste

2810
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:02,240
Okay so let's so I just get this straight

2811
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:04,032
Starting up 3130

2812
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:06,848
He filed his lawsuit in Seminole County court in

2813
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:07,616
Florida

2814
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:10,432
Not in federal court in Florida but in State Court

2815
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,992
There is a legal requirement called quote standing on

2816
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,064
He does not have standing to sue in Seminole County

2817
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:18,368
He was not a party in the shooting in any fashion

2818
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:21,696
There is also a concept called quote jurisdiction

2819
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:24,768
Either the man is lying or the judge is insane

2820
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:30,144
A Florida county level judge would not have jurisdiction for any reason other than a contract or

2821
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,424
Her crime issue

2822
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,216
Indirectly involving how big

2823
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:35,008
Something is completely wrong here

2824
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:36,544
How do you say

2825
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:39,616
Quote in the federal district of Florida quote

2826
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:42,432
Or whatever Discord it might be if the state is split

2827
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:43,712
That may at least be

2828
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,480
Possible

2829
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,784
This is completely insane

2830
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,832
And cannot go anywhere but into the trash

2831
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:52,928
No standing no subject matter jurisdiction no personal jurisdiction

2832
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:55,488
Two cents from a third-year law student who is

2833
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:56,512
Legally current

2834
02:30:56,768 --> 02:30:57,280
It is

2835
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,072
Demand seems to be

2836
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,352
Be grasping and stretch

2837
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,448
No judge in their right mind would do such a thing as he describes

2838
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:08,288
Here's an example imagine there's a crime in Las Vegas and the criminal killed him so

2839
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:10,336
There is no law whatsoever

2840
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:11,360
That would allow Alex

2841
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:12,640
Or anyone else to file

2842
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:14,432
San Antonio for anything regarding

2843
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:15,456
The crime in Las Vegas

2844
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,760
There's no claim that can be made in Texas

2845
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:19,552
For something that happened in Nevada

2846
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:20,320
It is a rule

2847
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,600
Are there

2848
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:25,696
So here we have

2849
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:26,976
That not only

2850
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,024
Did Infowars receive information

2851
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:32,096
Suggesting that what how big was up to

2852
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,888
Was completely insane

2853
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,424
Enduring Brumfield work

2854
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,472
But actually Nico ended up

2855
02:31:37,728 --> 02:31:39,264
Forwarding that information directly

2856
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:40,544
Correct

2857
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:41,312
Yes

2858
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:46,688
Which is good that he found that we got 10,000 miles there like we did

2859
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,480
What

2860
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:50,272
It's good that we found in 2015

2861
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:56,928
David wasn't shown to me but right

2862
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,744
And so that's why I was

2863
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:06,144
Yeah that it's good that it gets good good for you right now

2864
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:12,544
Make my jaw drop more like well it's good that he found that once

2865
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:18,944
Wait how could Rob do have kept this from me Rob I'd like you to also me

2866
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,480
My friend bus

2867
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:22,016
This might be bad for me

2868
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,552
You know what

2869
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:30,720
Rob sounds like a real piece of s*** is going to be busy

2870
02:32:30,976 --> 02:32:33,280
Very busy for awhile so

2871
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:37,120
The pattern with these emails that is its kind of

2872
02:32:37,376 --> 02:32:39,936
I've been Illustrated I believe is

2873
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:45,056
They have this horrible behavior that Wolfgang is engaging in evidence of

2874
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:46,080
Is

2875
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:52,480
Clearly in Infowars files people

2876
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:54,272
On these

2877
02:32:54,528 --> 02:33:00,672
I cc'd on these emails such as forwarding them further

2878
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:01,440
Emails

2879
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:06,560
Is forwarded further from Niko to Rob is

2880
02:33:06,816 --> 02:33:12,960
The sanity maybe you would take a second look at the person

2881
02:33:13,216 --> 02:33:17,824
And notice that hey there's these emails where he's harassing Sandy Hook family members

2882
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,896
You might you might think that would happen but I guess it didn't

2883
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:25,760
This is a bizarre sort of picture that you get from these

2884
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:32,160
These these emails but I think it's it's remarkable to see that Alex's response to this is

2885
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:38,816
Bordering on what he would expect a person to feel these emails and like this is a horrible

2886
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:41,632
Email that's that's awful I didn't know about this

2887
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:44,448
That's exactly what you would do if you didn't know

2888
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:49,824
Bad feelings

2889
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:56,224
So after this week into a little bit of a conversation about dhanbad on D and

2890
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:59,552
Alex sending him to to Newtown and

2891
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:04,416
What is the plays the clip of Alex calling bonati the Kraken

2892
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:10,816
The Krakens of mythological Beast right into

2893
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:15,680
Alex respond to like you know the Krakens that's not somebody that

2894
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:22,080
You knew he's going to go cause trouble and obviously that's the case

2895
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,616
Of course

2896
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:30,272
Which which version of the movie are you are you talking about

2897
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:36,672
I have a lot of thoughts about movies

2898
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:43,072
One last clip here from Alex's deposition

2899
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,632
A question of

2900
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:51,520
We've seen a lot of bad behavior from folks within Infowars Avi

2901
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:57,664
Sandy Hook and Wolfgang

2902
02:34:58,688 --> 02:35:02,016
The question of editorial standards and

2903
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,904
That kind of thing comes up she could have

2904
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:09,184
Your company

2905
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,208
Has never

2906
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:12,000
Discipline

2907
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,048
Due to

2908
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:15,072
False facts

2909
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:23,008
I don't remember

2910
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,288
Good work not barns

2911
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:28,384
You think it's possible you may have discipline Brad

2912
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:30,432
I would say false

2913
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:31,456
Robert

2914
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:32,736
Pictures of the trouble for

2915
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:33,760
Talk about it

2916
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:35,552
I've tried to like you know

2917
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:36,576
Stay out of it

2918
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:38,368
And myself back into it

2919
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:49,632
Stop

2920
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:53,472
Strikes against

2921
02:35:56,032 --> 02:35:58,080
Remember Florida Posner

2922
02:35:58,848 --> 02:36:04,992
Optimal make a big thing with me and when I pause or I barely know who he is and I've seen him in some shows but I know I

2923
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,272
I just did not

2924
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,320
Yes I mean I did not want to

2925
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,624
I had seen

2926
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,440
Some of the anomalies

2927
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
Proven

2928
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:15,488
Amelie's

2929
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:17,536
I wasn't sure that it was staged

2930
02:36:18,304 --> 02:36:20,352
Go back and forth

2931
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:23,424
These Mysteries

2932
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:24,960
What

2933
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,776
So that's that's that's where I stand on that

2934
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:30,848
That's not that it's not an ideal answer everybody

2935
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:36,480
Have you punished anybody is there any consequences for anybody who's published.

2936
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:43,136
Hey look at this industry I don't know I don't know how you could take this

2937
02:36:43,392 --> 02:36:44,160
To a jury

2938
02:36:44,672 --> 02:36:46,720
And not say to them like listen

2939
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:51,840
This is a man who's already lost the case this is a man who's Underoath

2940
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:53,888
Haha in a case that he lost

2941
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,936
For saying that this is

2942
02:36:56,192 --> 02:36:56,960
Real

2943
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,776
This isn't real

2944
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:05,664
Or might not be or he still has questions over it we're well past the point where you can say like

2945
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:07,456
Oh we'll have our day in court

2946
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:13,856
So there's no way to do anything other than say this man has to be stuck

2947
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:17,184
I think you know I think I think a lot of the

2948
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:23,072
The appearance that you get from from this deposition is certainly a lack of remorse

2949
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:25,888
A lack of haven't learned anything or lack of

2950
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:33,056
Even seeming to be willing to understand the problem basic comprehension of reality

2951
02:37:33,312 --> 02:37:34,080
Yes

2952
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:37,664
There's also clearly an indication that

2953
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:41,760
He intends to continue them

2954
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:48,160
I mean and and almost a a strange extreme solipsism

2955
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:52,512
Is this like what are you talking about this happened outside of what I experienced so it doesn't matter

2956
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,560
It's not real

2957
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:58,400
Cuz I didn't read this email so it doesn't matter to me

2958
02:37:58,656 --> 02:38:01,216
Yeah and even beyond that

2959
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:07,616
Like a real lack of institutional guardrails

2960
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,664
Play Infowars where there is no

2961
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:16,064
It's like standards for what they can or can't report there's no consequences for anything

2962
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:22,464
Standards for sending the f****** prosecution

2963
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,232
Plaintiff

2964
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:25,024
A f****** black

2965
02:38:25,536 --> 02:38:31,680
Which you don't know you did you did what we got it before we would start with the journal

2966
02:38:31,936 --> 02:38:38,080
Wild

2967
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,360
What's in the building

2968
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:41,920
Tenaya Jordan

2969
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:48,320
We jump over to the the deposition of

2970
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:50,624
Car Polo boy

2971
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:57,024
He was a little disappointed I believe I said that's what I'm talking to Mark that it wasn't robbed you again

2972
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:01,120
Characteristics

2973
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:03,168
Who asked

2974
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:08,288
Yes

2975
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:14,688
I think that will probably skip over a fair amount of this because it is

2976
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:19,808
Deposition was a lot of just like I don't know

2977
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:25,952
Like does the company know or not and I don't know I can't know if the company knows I don't know I don't know

2978
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:32,352
Yeah there's there is a a ton of that and the position itself is like 5 hours

2979
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:37,984
Long fry I'm so chop out a fair amount of that I just talked about what is

2980
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:44,384
Doesn't matter what's the point here I got a little bit of like what would it be

2981
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,688
We like to depose Donald Rumsfeld

2982
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:53,600
I think it might take less long pauses before answering

2983
02:39:53,856 --> 02:40:00,000
Flicker single question

2984
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:06,400
Call is much smarter than Alex

2985
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:12,800
To you that would help you I will say that I think that some of the strategies that she doesn't Floyd terms of answering questions

2986
02:40:13,056 --> 02:40:19,200
Not much better and maybe are more shocking and way more expensive than other things out.

2987
02:40:19,456 --> 02:40:20,736
Strap

2988
02:40:20,992 --> 02:40:27,136
At the beginning of this at the start of question to try and nail down how much prepper

2989
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:29,440
Duration Daria did for the deposition

2990
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:30,976
And with whom she consulted

2991
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:36,608
The preparation is clearly minimal and the kind of repetitive simonist get past that babe

2992
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:37,888
How about its disgust

2993
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:44,544
I'll put it this way on a scale of 1 to 10 she's not very prepared but a little more than Rob do

2994
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:50,944
1.2 baby

2995
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:57,344
It's not zero

2996
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:04,256
Number one

2997
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:10,656
Presenting Daria with a folder that she had brought along the container

2998
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:17,056
To introduce into evidence brought along

2999
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:19,872
Beautiful know I understand I've been given a folder

3000
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:22,688
You do recognize this folder that I'm holding right here

3001
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:26,272
Okay I've been told that these are documents that you review

3002
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:27,296
Prior to this deposition

3003
02:41:28,064 --> 02:41:28,576
Yes

3004
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:30,368
So you have taken

3005
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:34,720
The documents that you prepared yourself for today and put them in this holder

3006
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:37,792
I'm going to right now

3007
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:40,864
Individually

3008
02:41:44,192 --> 02:41:45,216
Yeah.

3009
02:41:45,472 --> 02:41:46,752
Okay

3010
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:52,384
Remember what I'm going to do is I'm going put a sticker on this folder itself

3011
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:54,432
And we're going to mark that is exhibit 1

3012
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:57,504
I want to talk to you about some of the documents in here

3013
02:41:58,016 --> 02:42:03,648
So each exhibit is going to be like

3014
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:10,048
Without giving away any privileged information

3015
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:11,584
This was the first one

3016
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:16,448
Yeah I'm terms of like what day

3017
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:21,824
So this was my first moments of being in the setting and

3018
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,104
I was just like

3019
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:25,664
I'd like I got to get a seat belt strap

3020
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:28,480
Because here is where we begin with these documents

3021
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:30,016
Marcus is 1 a

3022
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:32,064
You recognize that correct

3023
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:35,136
That's a document that you reviewed prior to this deposition right

3024
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,952
That is the Wikipedia entry for false

3025
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:38,720
Flag

3026
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:46,656
Can you tell me why you looked at this document

3027
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,568
I thought it would be a good idea to bring it on the rapper

3028
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:56,896
4

3029
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:57,664
Atomic number

3030
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:00,224
If I could have

3031
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:05,856
I understand we're send fact let's do that

3032
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:12,256
Is referring to is the sourcing and research that went into the Productions of the videos that the

3033
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:15,584
That are listed in the plaintiff's case so I don't know

3034
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:20,448
She needs the false flag Wikipedia page for I felt like this had not started well

3035
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,984
I was I was worried

3036
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:28,384
I mean if if if I'm thinking about this now and I'm thinking about removing this

3037
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:30,176
Sticker that says 1A

3038
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:36,576
And putting a new sticker on that says great job

3039
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:39,648
Four stars tell her to go home go by there

3040
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:43,232
Chris Rod so here's the next document we get

3041
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:46,048
So now I've handed you what I've marked as 1C

3042
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:47,584
What you recognize correct

3043
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:51,936
Correct and that is the Wikipedia entry for the reichstag fire correct

3044
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:57,056
Stock fire was hey

3045
02:43:58,592 --> 02:44:00,384
A Nazi party arson attack

3046
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,432
Correct

3047
02:44:05,248 --> 02:44:07,040
Can you tell me why this is Robert to the

3048
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,160
Same answer as for

3049
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,184
Go to previous

3050
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:15,232
I thought it would be

3051
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:18,560
Documentary

3052
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:20,864
Some of the points

3053
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:26,752
As an example of

3054
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:36,224
Okay another Wikipedia page to paraphrase the one funny thing Pete Holmes ever said it's

3055
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:42,624
Seems like you printed out a part of the internet for us to throw away yeah yeah yeah

3056
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:47,744
It's strange because again as a corporate representative

3057
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,792
Lionshare of wood

3058
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:55,680
She's supposed to be discussing his like sourcing and Personnel who worked on the videos and question

3059
02:44:55,936 --> 02:45:02,080
And that is nothing to do with the reichstag fires Wikipedia

3060
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:05,152
Fair enough

3061
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:07,456
Open t1d

3062
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:10,016
You recognize that

3063
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,808
Okay

3064
02:45:12,064 --> 02:45:15,648
Where does can you read the website at the bottom what website does not come from

3065
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:16,928
History today.

3066
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:20,256
Okay so this is a history today article

3067
02:45:20,512 --> 02:45:22,048
About the sinking of the Maine

3068
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,072
Correct correct

3069
02:45:24,096 --> 02:45:25,376
The USS Maine

3070
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:26,656
Was a

3071
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:28,192
19th century warship

3072
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:29,216
Correct

3073
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:33,312
And that warship exploded in Havana Harbor

3074
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:39,200
Correct

3075
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:40,480
There is significant

3076
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:41,760
Historical evidence

3077
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:42,784
To suggest

3078
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,600
But that ship was intentionally exploded by the United States

3079
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:46,624
That correct

3080
02:45:53,792 --> 02:45:54,560
There is a cop

3081
02:45:58,144 --> 02:46:01,216
What I'm what I'm wondering is from reading that article

3082
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:03,264
Did you come away with the idea

3083
02:46:03,775 --> 02:46:08,383
That there is substantial evidence in other words non-trivial evidence

3084
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:11,199
Which people could use to support the idea

3085
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:14,015
But the USS Maine was intentionally destroyed by the United

3086
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:26,815
What's a 1

3087
02:46:27,327 --> 02:46:28,095
Heard that

3088
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:29,887
Can you tell me why

3089
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:32,191
Particular article is relevant to your testimony today

3090
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:35,519
It could be viewed as

3091
02:46:36,031 --> 02:46:36,543
Example of false

3092
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:39,871
Throughout history

3093
02:46:40,383 --> 02:46:40,895
Cool

3094
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:47,295
This point I think it becomes a bit clearer that the strategy the articles that has in the folder box

3095
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:50,111
Illustrating that false Flags

3096
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:55,231
And plus it's not right or left field for Alex to question whether any of that may or may not be another one

3097
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:59,071
That's all good and well but it's really Superfluous to the questions at hand

3098
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:05,471
Most interesting is that while being questioned about the article concerning the sinking of the Maine

3099
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:11,871
Unwilling to commit to even saying that there's evidence it was a false flag only going so far as to say that there's controversy she's kg

3100
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:20,319
Early early stages of this I thought

3101
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:22,111
There was a little bit weird haha

3102
02:47:22,367 --> 02:47:28,511
But I guess maybe it could make some strategic sense in the air in that like to prove anything

3103
02:47:28,767 --> 02:47:29,279
The false flag

3104
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:35,679
All you have to do is prove that some things people say are

3105
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:42,847
Right eye I mean I want to ask this I just want to ask this question over and over and over again to all of these people

3106
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:43,615
Call just like

3107
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:47,711
Let's strip away all the b******* on a fundamental level

3108
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:49,759
Do you know why you're here

3109
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:50,783
Like just

3110
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,551
Just like

3111
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:55,135
Why are you what are you here to do

3112
02:47:56,159 --> 02:48:02,303
Yeah you know it's going back to have to get back to like fundamental

3113
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:05,887
What is water is it the wet stuff is that it

3114
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:09,983
Is it something else is it can you brief wash

3115
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:16,383
Hey listen if you think waters are and that's how we have to talk about it and I have to say water is air and Air

3116
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:22,783
Bridgewater that's f****** fine as long as we agree

3117
02:48:23,039 --> 02:48:29,183
Communication is the definition of terms you can't really

3118
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:33,023
And I do think that has come into a problem with

3119
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:36,607
Interacting with folks from Infowars As It Seems

3120
02:48:36,863 --> 02:48:39,935
From these depositions in particular that I've seen it.

3121
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:46,591
It's it seems like you're not having your talking in different language

3122
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:52,991
When we talked to Jon Ronson very briefly had this moment where we went kind of

3123
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:55,807
Far off any just said you know he was wondering

3124
02:48:56,319 --> 02:49:00,415
How is it that we can Judge Alex you know just in this sense of like

3125
02:49:00,671 --> 02:49:04,255
Do we judge him the way we judge other people because he's clearly not

3126
02:49:04,511 --> 02:49:05,791
Like other people

3127
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:09,375
Who can you judge him by what is the standard by which Alex can be judged

3128
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,399
And it's like

3129
02:49:10,655 --> 02:49:16,799
When you have an entire organization that is thinking it's totally fine to print out a Wikipedia

3130
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:18,591
Article and take it to a deposition

3131
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:20,383
I don't know

3132
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:21,151
They're alien

3133
02:49:21,407 --> 02:49:27,551
That's what that's what it is

3134
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:28,319
What is like

3135
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:31,391
Is this somebody's trying to Bluff a report

3136
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:36,255
Like it like it like it doesn't care

3137
02:49:36,767 --> 02:49:42,911
Or is it active insult

3138
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:49,311
Complete aliens I don't understand what is happening like the rest of these documents I'll help you sort that out

3139
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:50,335
I'm sure they will

3140
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,127
I'm going to put in front of u1e

3141
02:49:53,151 --> 02:49:54,175
You recognize that correct

3142
02:49:54,943 --> 02:50:00,063
Wikipedia entry for the Pearl Harbor Advanced knowledge conspiracy

3143
02:50:00,319 --> 02:50:01,087
Correct

3144
02:50:01,599 --> 02:50:02,367
Correct

3145
02:50:02,623 --> 02:50:04,415
Is this the same answers the other doctor

3146
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:06,719
So this is another example

3147
02:50:07,743 --> 02:50:08,511
Potentially

3148
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:14,399
What's The Back-up would you call this a false flag

3149
02:50:16,191 --> 02:50:16,959
Let me rephrase that

3150
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:21,823
If the allegations about this conspiracy theory or true would you consider that a false flag

3151
02:50:25,407 --> 02:50:31,551
Another Wikipedia article about conspiracy theories about Pearl Harbor at six point made

3152
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:35,647
I don't know you don't understand why we need more

3153
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:42,303
At least of the documents are all just Wikipedia Pages some of them are bios for weirdos

3154
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:45,631
Like the back of a book jacket

3155
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,287
Yes it is an article

3156
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:53,311
Nicole.

3157
02:50:54,847 --> 02:50:55,359
From

3158
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,383
The website

3159
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,223
Which

3160
02:51:02,271 --> 02:51:02,783
Biography

3161
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:04,063
Which I wanted to

3162
02:51:06,111 --> 02:51:09,951
Okay so this is just biographical information about one of them for sources

3163
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:14,559
So you got Wolfgang halbig bio

3164
02:51:14,815 --> 02:51:16,863
I am another buyer.

3165
02:51:17,119 --> 02:51:19,935
Alright I'ma show you the Marcus 1H recognize.

3166
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:22,751
Dr. Steve pieczenik website isn't it

3167
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:26,847
Enough with your biographies of dr. Steve pieczenik

3168
02:51:28,127 --> 02:51:29,663
And you wanted to have that

3169
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:32,735
Steve pieczenik is somebody who has appeared on Infowars at one point

3170
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:33,759
Talk about Sandy Hook

3171
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:40,927
I do regret that unfortunately in this deposition more questions are asked about Steve pieczenik

3172
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:45,023
Yeah because I think it having anybody has to answer for like

3173
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:48,095
Some of the bulshit bio

3174
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:54,751
How much of this do you actually think it can you tell me what's true and what's not true you brought it into evidence

3175
02:51:55,007 --> 02:52:01,151
That's what's going on now I mean I don't think it matters much

3176
02:52:01,407 --> 02:52:04,223
But at least it seems more relevant to

3177
02:52:04,479 --> 02:52:05,503
What you might bring

3178
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:08,575
Right then there's another document in there

3179
02:52:08,831 --> 02:52:10,367
And this is where things start to get

3180
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:15,743
Real picture things are real f*****-up at this point is really weird

3181
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:18,303
Okay I'm going to show you now what I have marked

3182
02:52:19,583 --> 02:52:20,351
That's one eye

3183
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:24,191
You recognize that

3184
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:26,495
That's a guardian article right

3185
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:29,823
Guardians of our newspaper brittenum I read about that

3186
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:33,663
Article says

3187
02:52:33,919 --> 02:52:37,247
Its headline says Sandy Hook father Leonard Posner on death threats

3188
02:52:37,503 --> 02:52:39,807
I never imagined having to fight for my child's life

3189
02:52:41,087 --> 02:52:43,135
What did you need this article for

3190
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:48,767
Why did you feel you wanted to review this article.

3191
02:52:49,791 --> 02:52:54,911
After this there is a long pause because a long pause

3192
02:52:55,167 --> 02:53:01,311
I don't know if it's a long pause of like trying to remember why or is it was like how do I say

3193
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:04,639
Goes off

3194
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:06,431
Love f****** rails

3195
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:08,479
The reason I wanted to have this article

3196
02:53:08,991 --> 02:53:09,759
Is that I saw it

3197
02:53:12,063 --> 02:53:13,343
One of the victim's mother

3198
02:53:14,623 --> 02:53:15,391
There was a

3199
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:17,951
Information regarding

3200
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:19,999
And her request

3201
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:23,839
President review

3202
02:53:34,591 --> 02:53:35,871
Seems to me that

3203
02:53:41,247 --> 02:53:41,759
The motivation

3204
02:53:47,391 --> 02:53:47,903
Death

3205
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:52,255
Man another reason for it is cuz a bunch of people are saying that travels

3206
02:53:55,327 --> 02:53:56,351
Could not be a reason for it

3207
02:53:59,167 --> 02:53:59,935
Oh boy

3208
02:54:00,191 --> 02:54:06,335
Oh boy she is a guardian articles that references How Stella Rosa

3209
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:10,943
To have an open-casket funeral

3210
02:54:11,199 --> 02:54:17,343
This feels real marked I see I'm not stoked about the direction it's going

3211
02:54:17,599 --> 02:54:21,183
I mean if your child

3212
02:54:21,951 --> 02:54:23,999
Right

3213
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:29,887
What's a 6 years now your child walks in elementary school and is massacre in a gun

3214
02:54:31,679 --> 02:54:33,983
And some news organizations are saying that your child is

3215
02:54:35,263 --> 02:54:38,335
Can you see that a possible way to combat that would be to have an open cast

3216
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:41,919
That's not something you would ever consider

3217
02:54:42,687 --> 02:54:44,479
You could use converging help somebody else could consider

3218
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:57,791
So you think

3219
02:54:58,559 --> 02:54:59,071
That this

3220
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,351
Jewish families

3221
02:55:01,375 --> 02:55:01,887
Choice

3222
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,423
Turn open casket funeral

3223
02:55:03,679 --> 02:55:04,447
Fairchild

3224
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:05,727
Was politically motivated

3225
02:55:07,263 --> 02:55:10,847
I'm going to inject his being outside the scope for corporate representative stefanik

3226
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:17,503
Discuss this objection and then they determined she should answer the question

3227
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:24,159
I thought Brad finally had one good thing might be fine but it's it's

3228
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:28,255
Answer the question the question back okay

3229
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:29,791
And

3230
02:55:30,303 --> 02:55:31,071
What has being Jewish

3231
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:33,631
I'm not here to answer

3232
02:55:36,703 --> 02:55:37,471
I don't know

3233
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,799
Make my personal opinion

3234
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:43,359
And I would never

3235
02:55:45,919 --> 02:55:47,967
People have open-casket funerals everyday don't they

3236
02:55:50,527 --> 02:55:53,343
Yes however considering the circumstances

3237
02:55:53,599 --> 02:55:54,111
And how

3238
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:54,879
The child was

3239
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:55,903
Figured

3240
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:07,423
Okay

3241
02:56:07,679 --> 02:56:13,823
Sorry I didn't pick up on this but the reason that Mark brought up the fact that the parent is tuition decided to have an open-casket funeral

3242
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:14,591
Golfer Sun

3243
02:56:14,847 --> 02:56:15,871
Is because that's a huge deal

3244
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:19,967
The most Jewish Traditions it's not acceptable to have an open-casket funeral

3245
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:24,575
Out of respect it's traditionally understood that you're not supposed to gaze upon the face of the deceased

3246
02:56:25,087 --> 02:56:31,231
Person of Jewish Heritage make a decision to have an open-casket funeral because people were saying that our son didn't exist

3247
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:35,071
Very strong conviction that the world not be allowed to pretend that this didn't happen

3248
02:56:35,327 --> 02:56:38,399
Or try to meant mentally hide behind safe images

3249
02:56:38,911 --> 02:56:41,983
Asmarani cuz the mother in question told the forward

3250
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:48,383
Quote I just want people to know the ugliness of it so we don't talk about it at stract Lee like these little angels went

3251
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:51,199
The heaven know they were butchered they were brutalized

3252
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:52,735
And that's what haunts me at night

3253
02:56:53,503 --> 02:56:59,647
It's a subtle Nuance that's being hinted at in this question that's completely missed by Dario because in preparation for this deposition

3254
02:56:59,903 --> 02:57:01,951
It doesn't seem like she's done all that much

3255
02:57:02,207 --> 02:57:02,719
Spill

3256
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:09,119
A little better prepared than robbed it's impossible to beat that bar never going to do worse than him

3257
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:09,887
Wild Thing

3258
02:57:10,143 --> 02:57:16,287
I mean the worst part out I guess drunk

3259
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:19,359
The strange thing is I believe her

3260
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:20,383
But

3261
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:26,783
Partially because she's on the other side so she's not going to do that stuff because she knows it won't f******

3262
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:33,183
Do a thing I kind of agree with you not emotionally agree that she is not lying

3263
02:57:33,439 --> 02:57:39,583
Do this for political reasons and if you had a heart you would never do

3264
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:50,847
Somebody would do it sounds it sounds like

3265
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:53,919
So we got another article this is weird

3266
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:56,223
There's another article about that right

3267
02:57:56,479 --> 02:57:57,247
Exhibit one

3268
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,015
Jay

3269
02:57:58,527 --> 02:58:00,831
Do you actually two separate articles

3270
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:03,391
About Noah Pozner funeral having an open car

3271
02:58:04,927 --> 02:58:05,439
Correct

3272
02:58:08,767 --> 02:58:11,327
I pulled this one article because of his LinkedIn the guardian

3273
02:58:11,839 --> 02:58:12,351
And I wanted

3274
02:58:15,167 --> 02:58:16,447
I'm thorough baby

3275
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:17,471
Okay

3276
02:58:17,983 --> 02:58:18,495
And so

3277
02:58:19,007 --> 02:58:20,799
Of all the documents that you've reviewed

3278
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:22,591
Regarding the plaintiffs

3279
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:26,175
The only ones you've reviewed that you chose to go review

3280
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:29,247
We're two articles about mrs. Bozeman choosing to have an open casket

3281
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:31,039
Correct

3282
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:36,159
That wasn't the real

3283
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:37,951
Article

3284
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:39,231
That's not what I'm asking you

3285
02:58:40,255 --> 02:58:43,583
I'm asking you of all the documents reviewed about the claims

3286
02:58:43,839 --> 02:58:44,863
Before this deposition

3287
02:58:45,375 --> 02:58:47,423
The only two that you did review

3288
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:51,007
Are articles that discuss Noah Pozner funeral having an open casket

3289
02:58:52,287 --> 02:58:52,799
Correct

3290
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:55,103
They happen to mention

3291
02:58:58,431 --> 02:59:00,991
I'm not saying that I'm not I understand what you're saying

3292
02:59:01,247 --> 02:59:02,783
Let's make it even broader than for you

3293
02:59:03,295 --> 02:59:05,599
The only two pieces of documentation

3294
02:59:05,855 --> 02:59:09,183
If you have reviewed for this deposition about the plaintiff

3295
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:11,231
Are two articles

3296
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:13,535
Both of which discussed in the article

3297
02:59:13,791 --> 02:59:15,071
Noah Pozner open casket

3298
02:59:19,423 --> 02:59:19,935
Correct

3299
02:59:20,447 --> 02:59:24,799
Tell me any other information from those articles that you believe is irrelevant to the deposition today

3300
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,367
I've already mentioned.

3301
02:59:43,487 --> 02:59:45,023
Physical body

3302
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:58,591
Okay so when it comes down to the documents that you reviewed for this deposition about the planets

3303
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:02,687
The only information that you really cleaning from this that useful to the stuff

3304
03:00:02,943 --> 03:00:03,455
Deposition

3305
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:04,223
How to

3306
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:08,063
Add concerns Noah Pozner open casket and appearances

3307
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:09,343
Correct

3308
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:11,903
It was used

3309
03:00:14,719 --> 03:00:16,255
I'm not asking what it's useful for

3310
03:00:16,767 --> 03:00:18,047
It's this is bizarre

3311
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:18,815
Like it

3312
03:00:20,095 --> 03:00:22,399
Do you have Wikipedia articles

3313
03:00:22,911 --> 03:00:29,055
Steve and Wolfgang self-written correct and multiple articles about to deposit

3314
03:00:29,311 --> 03:00:35,455
Noah Pozner having a open casket funeral

3315
03:00:35,711 --> 03:00:36,735
Subtitle this deposition

3316
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:38,271
It would be

3317
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:44,927
When you say it like that weight

3318
03:00:45,183 --> 03:00:50,047
Every time it's like she hears it for the first time

3319
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:53,375
Oh well when you put it like that it sure sounds like I'm an a******

3320
03:00:56,191 --> 03:01:00,287
Deep bizarreness

3321
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:05,663
This is just the amuse-bouche of how bizarre this is going to get

3322
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:12,063
Mark tries to get into the actual topics that she's there as a corporate representative to discuss

3323
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:13,599
And that's that is a

3324
03:01:13,855 --> 03:01:14,879
As a dead end

3325
03:01:15,391 --> 03:01:16,159
Number one

3326
03:01:17,695 --> 03:01:18,719
Is a sourcing research

3327
03:01:18,975 --> 03:01:20,767
The videos described Appliance petitions

3328
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:24,095
When the last time you watch those videos

3329
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:31,263
Backup made an assumption that

3330
03:01:31,519 --> 03:01:33,055
If you watch the videos

3331
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:35,359
Ever in your history of in divorce

3332
03:01:40,223 --> 03:01:41,503
What okay

3333
03:01:46,111 --> 03:01:47,647
So what you say is

3334
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:50,719
That in preparation for this deposition you didn't watch those

3335
03:01:57,119 --> 03:01:57,631
I'm sorry

3336
03:02:03,007 --> 03:02:03,775
Well I've already answered

3337
03:02:05,567 --> 03:02:08,639
Right now I understand that you have in your history Infowars

3338
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:09,663
2015

3339
03:02:09,919 --> 03:02:12,223
You probably on occasion seen some of these video

3340
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:12,991
I understand

3341
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:17,343
What I'm asking you is since the date you were told you were given this deposition November

3342
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,879
And you were preparing for this deposition

3343
03:02:22,975 --> 03:02:23,487
So

3344
03:02:23,743 --> 03:02:24,511
This is

3345
03:02:25,023 --> 03:02:31,167
The bad start cuz you now know that like you not going to really be familiar with the V

3346
03:02:31,423 --> 03:02:32,191
Videos in question

3347
03:02:32,447 --> 03:02:38,591
Right Alright is kind of limiting is your ability to testify as a percent

3348
03:02:38,847 --> 03:02:40,127
Yeah

3349
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:45,759
Once we established here that she hasn't watched these videos and preparation

3350
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:50,367
It turns out the also that bike by extension that means she doesn't even know

3351
03:02:50,623 --> 03:02:51,647
What they say

3352
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:53,183
You see that

3353
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:57,023
Paragraph 14 identify as of January 27th 2013 video

3354
03:02:57,791 --> 03:02:58,303
Entitled

3355
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:01,119
Why people think Sandy Hook is a hoax

3356
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:02,911
Okay

3357
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,727
You're familiar with the claims made in that video right

3358
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:08,031
Fraction form

3359
03:03:15,199 --> 03:03:16,735
I don't recall the exact video

3360
03:03:17,759 --> 03:03:19,295
Inside sitting here today

3361
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:21,343
You're not coming with the claims made in that video

3362
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:27,231
And because of this

3363
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:33,887
So much of the questions that are being asked end up being a jerk guessing I don't know

3364
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:37,727
What are the sources with as well I would assume that it's Wolfgang halbig

3365
03:03:37,983 --> 03:03:44,127
Or you know like I have an educated guess that it's this person

3366
03:03:44,383 --> 03:03:50,527
What did you do to try and figure out if anything I'll who made this video who worked on this what are the sources

3367
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:59,999
I mean how do they pick who shows up for the did they throw a dart or something

3368
03:04:00,255 --> 03:04:06,399
Like what is happening I think there's an Infowars Elder who goes into a trance

3369
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:11,519
Choose somebody bananas

3370
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:16,127
Yeah confidence with which you would walk into what amounts to

3371
03:04:16,383 --> 03:04:18,431
The end of your professional career

3372
03:04:18,687 --> 03:04:23,551
So we're going to skip a bunch of the back-and-forth of just like

3373
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:26,623
Who did who did this

3374
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:28,415
Probably Wolfgang probably will

3375
03:04:28,671 --> 03:04:34,815
And there's a lot of it because it's not relevant

3376
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:36,095
Sure of how

3377
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:40,959
Unprepared she was for this deposition and the lack of respect being shown

3378
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:47,615
But it in terms of we're doing the show also right

3379
03:04:47,871 --> 03:04:54,015
It was clearly in the room

3380
03:04:54,271 --> 03:04:56,319
A question about

3381
03:04:57,087 --> 03:04:58,111
The Super Bowl

3382
03:04:58,367 --> 03:05:04,511
Right so this is the pic of it Alex was asked about no B

3383
03:05:04,767 --> 03:05:10,143
Pico and we we couldn't determine whether or not Alex at answer if this is crazy

3384
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:13,471
Actually he did you did say it was crazy

3385
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:18,079
Here is a market beginning to bring this up to you Daria

3386
03:05:18,847 --> 03:05:20,383

3397
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:48,799
And you will see the bottom email mr. how big right to Nico

3398
03:05:50,335 --> 03:05:52,639
Do you know who Nathaniel folks has the person who copies

3399
03:05:54,431 --> 03:05:54,943
No

3400
03:05:55,199 --> 03:05:57,503

03:05:58,015 --> 03:05:59,039
What's a job title

3402
03:06:03,391 --> 03:06:05,439
At this time

3403
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:09,791
He would be

3404
03:06:13,375 --> 03:06:15,423
Niko's no longer employed by Infowars

3405
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:18,751
Infowars possess his last known contact information

3406
03:06:25,151 --> 03:06:26,943

03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:31,551
States Nico the picture of the Sandy Hook Elementary School choir

Is one of the keys

3409
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:35,391
Other pictures are great for discussion

3410
03:06:35,647 --> 03:06:36,159
These

3411
03:06:36,671 --> 03:06:38,975
Are the CT crime picture

3412
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:41,535
Yes

3413
03:06:43,071 --> 03:06:47,679

I read that correctly

3418
03:06:56,895 --> 03:06:58,175
The final email says

3419
03:06:58,431 --> 03:06:59,967
As long as you and Alex can put up

3420
03:07:02,015 --> 03:07:05,343
Yes just help you refresh your memory about what the Superbowl picture is

3421
03:07:07,135 --> 03:07:13,279
Niko's response

3422
03:07:13,535 --> 03:07:19,679
I will see if I can say one positive thing about Wolfgang how big is it sometimes

3423
03:07:19,935 --> 03:07:21,215
Wolf

3424
03:07:21,471 --> 03:07:23,263
Yeah but it's not consistent

3425
03:07:23,775 --> 03:07:29,919
Yeah I know I think if my name was Wolfgang I'll be constantly making people call me wolf

3426
03:07:30,175 --> 03:07:36,319
We get to talk about the Super Bowl tickets

3427
03:07:37,087 --> 03:07:38,623
God this is

3428
03:07:40,159 --> 03:07:41,183
I don't even I'm

3429
03:07:42,207 --> 03:07:45,535
Having trouble figuring out how to display

3430
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:50,399
Prepare you for how insane I can't be prepared

3431
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:52,703
Michelle Martinez

3432
03:07:53,983 --> 03:07:55,775
You take a look at that picture for me

3433
03:08:01,663 --> 03:08:02,943
Do you see at the bottom corner

3434
03:08:03,455 --> 03:08:05,247
What does fsspx

3435
03:08:05,503 --> 03:08:06,783
04

3436
03:08:07,551 --> 03:08:08,319
For sex

3437
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:09,343
476

3438
03:08:09,855 --> 03:08:10,367
Yes

3439
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:12,159
Have you seen this picture before

3440
03:08:14,719 --> 03:08:15,743
Personally I have not

3441
03:08:18,303 --> 03:08:20,095
This was a document though you can tell from it

3442
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:21,375
Number to bottom that was

3443
03:08:21,887 --> 03:08:23,167
Produced by the company correct

3444
03:08:25,983 --> 03:08:29,311
Can you read what it says at the very top of the picture there white text

3445
03:08:30,591 --> 03:08:32,639
10 Sandy Hook children found alive

3446
03:08:35,199 --> 03:08:36,223
This

3447
03:08:37,503 --> 03:08:39,551
The company now admit that this picture is

3448
03:08:40,575 --> 03:08:41,599
Outrageous

3449
03:08:42,367 --> 03:08:43,135
Injections for

3450
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:49,791
Rubbermaid B listen it's been a long f****** trial

3451
03:08:50,047 --> 03:08:56,191
And you guys have been dicks are you ready to admit that this is outrageous excuse me are you ready

3452
03:08:56,447 --> 03:08:59,775
To say you're full of s*** neener neener neener go f*** yourself

3453
03:09:01,055 --> 03:09:06,687
So apparently this is this is this is worth an objection deteriorates

3454
03:09:06,943 --> 03:09:08,735
What I'm saying is if there's an expert

3455
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:10,527
And you better remind on

3456
03:09:11,295 --> 03:09:13,855
Gospel Smith School Safety shooting expert whatever it is

3457
03:09:14,623 --> 03:09:15,647
You're relying on it

3458
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:16,927
And then

3459
03:09:17,183 --> 03:09:17,695
Hypothetically

3460
03:09:18,207 --> 03:09:19,487
That person to start saying

3461
03:09:19,999 --> 03:09:20,767
Absolutely crazy

3462
03:09:22,047 --> 03:09:23,839
And it's pretty clear they're going off The Rocker

3463
03:09:24,351 --> 03:09:25,887
Maybe they were even credible at one time

3464
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:28,703
But suddenly they start saying a bunch of crazy things

3465
03:09:29,983 --> 03:09:33,055
To the company when is deciding whether to put stuff on about Sandy Hook

3466
03:09:34,335 --> 03:09:38,687
It needs to get it should consider whether what the things its expert Usain

3467
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:39,711
Are crazy

3468
03:09:40,223 --> 03:09:40,735
Correct

3469
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:43,039
She's the expert

3470
03:09:44,575 --> 03:09:45,855
To knows a lot more

3471
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:47,647
On the subject that any of us

3472
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:48,671
Working

3473
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:53,791
It would be reasonable to believe that

3474
03:09:54,815 --> 03:09:55,839
Want to listen what

3475
03:09:58,143 --> 03:09:58,655
Information

3476
03:09:59,679 --> 03:10:00,959
What exactly

3477
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:02,751
In Wolfgang halbig history

3478
03:10:03,007 --> 03:10:03,775
And expertise

3479
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:06,591
Makes him an expert that you should defer to

3480
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:07,871
On whether this

3481
03:10:08,127 --> 03:10:09,407
Picture of the Super Bowl choir

3482
03:10:09,919 --> 03:10:11,199
She's actually

3483
03:10:11,455 --> 03:10:12,991
Pictures of children who were murdered

3484
03:10:13,247 --> 03:10:16,319
Well that's a good question that's why I brought his bio be capitalized

3485
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:17,343
Read

3486
03:10:17,599 --> 03:10:18,111
No

3487
03:10:18,623 --> 03:10:20,671
You just like you know or what

3488
03:10:20,927 --> 03:10:24,255
No Wyld no wild dogs

3489
03:10:24,511 --> 03:10:30,655
No really interesting is going on there is like Dory is essentially appealing to Authority you know like

3490
03:10:30,911 --> 03:10:36,287
Just was like really

3491
03:10:36,543 --> 03:10:40,639
You're going to you're going to tell me if the expert says crazy things

3492
03:10:40,895 --> 03:10:46,015
They're not crazy because this person the expert those things by being said by this person

3493
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:48,063
Become credible that's

3494
03:10:48,319 --> 03:10:49,343
Weird Helga

3495
03:10:49,599 --> 03:10:53,695
So what you're telling me is that the editorial standard for Infowars

3496
03:10:53,951 --> 03:10:55,999
Is if somebody was an expert

3497
03:10:56,255 --> 03:10:57,023
We would

3498
03:10:57,535 --> 03:10:58,559
Believe them

3499
03:10:58,815 --> 03:11:03,423
Do we even qualify that for that's a good point if they claim to be an expert

3500
03:11:03,935 --> 03:11:10,079
So before we even get to expert if you make up credentials for yourself that I really impressive you get to just

3501
03:11:10,335 --> 03:11:16,479
Do whatever you want so you're telling me that the information from the

3502
03:11:16,735 --> 03:11:22,879
The mainstream media do a lot of backgrounds for 11 hours a day

3503
03:11:23,135 --> 03:11:29,279
Until 5 in the morning sometimes always researching you're telling me that you don't need to verify any that should I drop

3504
03:11:31,327 --> 03:11:36,447
So Mark wants to know if this person this picture of the Superbowl choir that was sent to me go

3505
03:11:36,703 --> 03:11:41,567
It was made by a sane person sitting here right now

3506
03:11:41,823 --> 03:11:43,359
This was not created

3507
03:11:43,615 --> 03:11:44,639
Irrational

3508
03:11:44,895 --> 03:11:45,407
Saying

3509
03:11:45,663 --> 03:11:47,711
Human being or are you going to tell this jury

3510
03:11:47,967 --> 03:11:48,991
That this is creative

3511
03:11:49,247 --> 03:11:51,039
Buy rational sane human being

3512
03:11:54,367 --> 03:11:55,135
I don't have an opinion

3513
03:11:56,671 --> 03:11:57,951
So you see this picture

3514
03:11:58,719 --> 03:12:04,863
And I'm trying to determine whether it was created by saying rational human being you look at it and go I have no phone

3515
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:05,631
Feelings either way

3516
03:12:06,143 --> 03:12:06,911
Correct

3517
03:12:07,935 --> 03:12:09,727
I'm not a psychiatric Medical

3518
03:12:11,263 --> 03:12:11,775
Who's playing

3519
03:12:13,823 --> 03:12:18,687
That's better quite at quite a response I mean you know

3520
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:19,455
Listen

3521
03:12:19,711 --> 03:12:25,855
Goldwater rule what you going to do if there's really no way around that from like a questioning perspectives really like

3522
03:12:26,111 --> 03:12:28,671
Like I guess you aren't but right

3523
03:12:28,927 --> 03:12:33,023
You're just trying to dodge the question of the gate that very clear if you look at this would be like

3524
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:33,791
This is

3525
03:12:34,047 --> 03:12:40,191
Well as Mark said outrageous the problem with this little chunk right here is

3526
03:12:40,447 --> 03:12:42,751
We're in a situation where

3527
03:12:43,007 --> 03:12:46,591
The rules are such that you can't Mark can't be like a listen

3528
03:12:47,103 --> 03:12:48,895
You know and she can't be like

3529
03:12:49,151 --> 03:12:49,919
I know

3530
03:12:50,175 --> 03:12:56,319
But you know right and he can't be like what yeah I know I know why just level with me for a second

3531
03:12:56,575 --> 03:13:02,719
Everybody knows what's going on this is so infuriating to me it's because Mark knows she's full of s*** and she knows she's full

3532
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:07,071
I agree I agree that that is a frustrating guide

3533
03:13:07,327 --> 03:13:08,351
Listen to me

3534
03:13:08,863 --> 03:13:15,007
That Dynamic brakes changes good in the midst of this convo

3535
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:21,151
Versation about whether or not a sane person would make this Super Bowl picture and

3536
03:13:21,919 --> 03:13:22,943
Oh my God

3537
03:13:23,455 --> 03:13:27,039
You would disobey I sent you this while you were doing reporting you would thank them for it

3538
03:13:28,831 --> 03:13:30,367
I don't know it depends on

3539
03:13:30,879 --> 03:13:33,951
Okay well the circumstances

3540
03:13:34,975 --> 03:13:35,487
Having discipline

3541
03:13:35,743 --> 03:13:36,255
James Walden

3542
03:13:39,071 --> 03:13:41,119
Why I'm asking you what if you with this information

3543
03:13:41,887 --> 03:13:43,423
A picture that says at the top

3544
03:13:43,935 --> 03:13:46,495
10 Sandy Hook children found alive and well

3545
03:13:46,751 --> 03:13:48,287
End of the Super Bowl choir

3546
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:49,823
From millions of people

3547
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:53,663
Would you look at that and go

3548
03:13:54,943 --> 03:13:55,967
Personally

3549
03:13:56,735 --> 03:13:58,015
I would

3550
03:13:58,783 --> 03:14:01,343
Rather think that those kids were alive

3551
03:14:02,623 --> 03:14:03,647
Then

3552
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:04,927
Then

3553
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:05,951
Hiding

3554
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:09,279
Because I want it

3555
03:14:10,815 --> 03:14:11,327
Murdered

3556
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:12,095
For no reason

3557
03:14:14,655 --> 03:14:15,167
Innocent

3558
03:14:15,679 --> 03:14:16,447
Children who didn't

3559
03:14:16,703 --> 03:14:17,215
Deserve what

3560
03:14:17,983 --> 03:14:18,495
That

3561
03:14:20,543 --> 03:14:21,055
I would

3562
03:14:21,567 --> 03:14:22,591
Hold out hope

3563
03:14:24,127 --> 03:14:26,431
To the last bit of my

3564
03:14:26,687 --> 03:14:27,199
Soul

3565
03:14:27,711 --> 03:14:28,223
Hoping

3566
03:14:28,735 --> 03:14:29,503
Praying the

3567
03:14:30,015 --> 03:14:30,527
That picture

3568
03:14:30,783 --> 03:14:31,295
It was

3569
03:14:31,807 --> 03:14:33,087
That that was something that

3570
03:14:33,855 --> 03:14:34,879
Possible for those kids

3571
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:36,415
Pedialyte

3572
03:14:40,767 --> 03:14:46,911
If I saw that picture and then ask somebody question about that picture and then they gave me that response

3573
03:14:47,167 --> 03:14:53,311
Would throw a table through the wall I almost gasp that is f****** crazy

3574
03:14:53,567 --> 03:14:59,711
Such a bizarre response of the questioning over the Superbowl picture it's not even relevant to the question she was being asked

3575
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:00,991
I'm tired of her own

3576
03:15:01,247 --> 03:15:04,319
Desire to express this okay

3577
03:15:04,575 --> 03:15:10,719
It's really hard to understand this mentality unless you recognize the people like Daria and I would assume most of the be

3578
03:15:11,743 --> 03:15:16,863
Don't ascribe to the rules of reality with things like cause-and-effect or object permanence

3579
03:15:17,119 --> 03:15:23,263
In her mind choosing to believe that the kids who were killed at Sandy Hook are actually secretly of the choir at the Super Bowl

3580
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:26,079
Optimistic idea because the alternative is choosing

3581
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:27,615
To believe that the kids are at

3582
03:15:28,127 --> 03:15:34,271
There's so many problems with this idea in the most obvious being that which is describing as a speculative living in a fantasy world cup

3583
03:15:34,527 --> 03:15:35,551
Is realities too tough

3584
03:15:36,063 --> 03:15:38,367
But also she seems to be ignoring how

3585
03:15:38,623 --> 03:15:44,767
This isn't an isolated thing like if the kids at Sandy Hook were secretly in that choir the implications of that are horrifico

3586
03:15:45,023 --> 03:15:51,167
And I don't I don't know if this would actually be an optimistic scenario

3587
03:15:51,423 --> 03:15:57,567
Just pulled off a massive they were rubbing it in

3588
03:15:57,823 --> 03:16:00,383
I suspect those kids would not live past halftime

3589
03:16:00,639 --> 03:16:04,735
These are the people who work for the literal devil they're not above that s***

3590
03:16:05,247 --> 03:16:10,623
I find it hard to believe that if the globalists did something like this they would just leave those loose hanging threads

3591
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:15,231
Out there I mean for your response to that question to just be like you know

3592
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:16,255
I choose hope

3593
03:16:16,511 --> 03:16:18,303
And it's just f******

3594
03:16:20,095 --> 03:16:26,239
So when I heard Daria say that I thought well this trip has been worth it.

3595
03:16:26,495 --> 03:16:32,639
You had heard something that was completely unpredictable I never expected

3596
03:16:32,895 --> 03:16:34,943
Good here and then it actually even goes on

3597
03:16:35,455 --> 03:16:36,991
So if you think about it

3598
03:16:38,783 --> 03:16:39,807
If you think about it

3599
03:16:40,575 --> 03:16:43,135
It's apparent to my clients on this picture

3600
03:16:46,463 --> 03:16:49,279
They should they should react positively to this

3601
03:16:49,535 --> 03:16:50,303
Directions

3602
03:16:50,559 --> 03:16:51,583
Inform

3603
03:16:54,655 --> 03:16:55,167
I'm not though

3604
03:16:55,423 --> 03:16:56,447
There is I'm looking at it as

3605
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:57,727
Cider

3606
03:16:58,495 --> 03:17:00,799
And I would much rather and I don't know a person

3607
03:17:01,311 --> 03:17:02,335
Hard would rather

3608
03:17:02,591 --> 03:17:03,103
Think

3609
03:17:03,615 --> 03:17:05,151
Rather believe that the

3610
03:17:05,663 --> 03:17:06,175
Dad

3611
03:17:06,431 --> 03:17:06,943
Versus

3612
03:17:07,967 --> 03:17:08,991
It's might be a lot

3613
03:17:09,503 --> 03:17:12,063
I would say it's reasonable for a person with a heart

3614
03:17:12,575 --> 03:17:14,111
To have that sort of

3615
03:17:14,367 --> 03:17:15,135
Optimism

3616
03:17:16,671 --> 03:17:18,207
I'm sure Alex one

3617
03:17:18,975 --> 03:17:21,535
You said those kids if there was any possibility

3618
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:22,815
But the kids

3619
03:17:23,327 --> 03:17:24,095
We're Not Dead

3620
03:17:24,351 --> 03:17:26,143
Then she was going to grab onto it be

3621
03:17:26,399 --> 03:17:27,423
Because that's a much better

3622
03:17:27,679 --> 03:17:28,447
Proposition

3623
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:29,215
Have

3624
03:17:29,727 --> 03:17:30,495
Heart and mind

3625
03:17:31,007 --> 03:17:31,519
Then

3626
03:17:32,031 --> 03:17:32,543
2

3627
03:17:33,055 --> 03:17:34,079
To realize that

3628
03:17:36,127 --> 03:17:36,895
Alex Jones

3629
03:17:37,663 --> 03:17:38,943
According to

3630
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:39,711
The company View

3631
03:17:44,831 --> 03:17:45,599
Alex Jones

3632
03:17:46,111 --> 03:17:47,647
Said the kids didn't really die

3633
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:49,439
And they were really alive

3634
03:17:49,951 --> 03:17:50,463
Impart

3635
03:17:51,487 --> 03:17:51,999
Such a big

3636
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:53,535
And a lot of Hope

3637
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:55,839
Attractions

3638
03:17:56,863 --> 03:18:00,703
If you might not have heard it cuz the lawyer was talking but she said yes

3639
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:07,359
Truly bizarre and remember this is somebody testifying at a corporate

3640
03:18:07,615 --> 03:18:13,759
Official capacity and still decided to take a very ill-advised

3641
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:20,159
The editorial position of info

3642
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:26,559
Warriors and Free Speech systems is that not only was Santa real in Miracle on 34th Street he is real

3643
03:18:26,815 --> 03:18:29,119
Outside of Miracle on the 34th Street

3644
03:18:29,375 --> 03:18:35,519
If I were Mark I would have kept pressing on this line of thought to really determine if Daria thinks that her believe somehow affects world

3645
03:18:35,775 --> 03:18:41,919
Like if she believes that are thinking that the kids were alive has any bearing on whether or not they are actually alive

3646
03:18:42,175 --> 03:18:44,735
From these comments I am not sure

3647
03:18:44,991 --> 03:18:50,623
I mean you know that's the weird thing that I'm getting right now I was so quick to believe her earlier

3648
03:18:50,879 --> 03:18:57,023
Whenever she said that she wouldn't do that stuff because I do believe that she does things

3649
03:18:57,279 --> 03:18:58,047
Take that if you were

3650
03:18:58,559 --> 03:19:03,423
I knew that you would never engage with conspiracy theorist if your if your kid dies because

3651
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:05,983
It won't matter either way like that makes sense to me

3652
03:19:06,239 --> 03:19:08,287
She sang this with the same

3653
03:19:08,543 --> 03:19:14,687
Tone of of like emotional honesty and this is batshit crazy yes there are a couple Moana

3654
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:21,087
Commence where you get that outside of the I don't know right like a b or c

3655
03:19:21,343 --> 03:19:26,975
Suzanne I didn't do anything to prepare for this moment speaker like

3656
03:19:27,487 --> 03:19:29,279
That I was like really stand out

3657
03:19:29,535 --> 03:19:30,559
And I think

3658
03:19:30,815 --> 03:19:36,959
This one is particularly upsetting about

3659
03:19:40,287 --> 03:19:44,127
Like the fact that she can't register or refuses to register that

3660
03:19:44,383 --> 03:19:44,895
What that

3661
03:19:45,151 --> 03:19:46,687
Obviously

3662
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:53,087
It makes her idea look absurd of course to parents are Furious

3663
03:19:53,343 --> 03:19:57,439
So here's the dumb thing you said I'm going to take it to a logical endpoint

3664
03:19:57,695 --> 03:20:00,511
And now you're going to see that it's dumb and she's like well

3665
03:20:00,767 --> 03:20:06,911
I would rather die than see that it's actually much more comfortable to live in this dumb place

3666
03:20:07,935 --> 03:20:10,495
Congratulations if you have a heart

3667
03:20:11,519 --> 03:20:12,031
How

3668
03:20:12,543 --> 03:20:18,687
Could you not believe that I am riding a unicorn home after that we record this show you have a heart

3669
03:20:18,943 --> 03:20:25,087
There is there is also this focus of like having a heart

3670
03:20:25,343 --> 03:20:31,487
Sure we've arrested destroyed many people's lives but that's cuz we have a heart

3671
03:20:31,743 --> 03:20:32,511
For the good of

3672
03:20:33,023 --> 03:20:39,167
Hearts all of you lawyers trying to get some sort of remuneration for the Sandy Hook families that we've bad

3673
03:20:39,423 --> 03:20:41,471
Edgerton and horrific Lee f***** with

3674
03:20:41,727 --> 03:20:44,287
For the past 10 years or whatever it is

3675
03:20:44,543 --> 03:20:50,175
Those people call in for Cheerios cuz heart healthy heart friendly

3676
03:20:51,199 --> 03:20:52,735
Alright so sorry

3677
03:20:52,991 --> 03:20:58,367
There's more questions that you can't answer about sourcing the end up taking a break

3678
03:20:58,623 --> 03:21:01,695
And this is where I was like oh my God

3679
03:21:02,207 --> 03:21:05,791
So I think there's a recognition they like she's in trouble

3680
03:21:06,815 --> 03:21:10,143
She they're talking about an April 22nd 2017 video call Sandy

3681
03:21:10,655 --> 03:21:11,423
Vampires exposed

3682
03:21:12,447 --> 03:21:15,263
You understand that at the video that mr. Posner and

3683
03:21:15,519 --> 03:21:16,543
Delarosa baster

3684
03:21:16,799 --> 03:21:17,311
Summation Clement

3685
03:21:18,847 --> 03:21:19,615
Did you know that

3686
03:21:22,431 --> 03:21:23,199
Did you know that

3687
03:21:23,967 --> 03:21:24,991
When preparing for the stuff

3688
03:21:29,855 --> 03:21:30,623
You watch that video

3689
03:21:34,463 --> 03:21:36,767
I mean unless you watch that last couple hours you haven't watched

3690
03:21:38,559 --> 03:21:40,095
For this deposition

3691
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:41,375
Familiar with the video

3692
03:21:41,887 --> 03:21:42,655
Did you watch it

3693
03:21:43,167 --> 03:21:44,447
In preparing for this deposition though

3694
03:21:47,775 --> 03:21:48,543
Okay

3695
03:21:49,055 --> 03:21:49,567
When did you watch it

3696
03:21:52,895 --> 03:21:53,663
Earlier today when

3697
03:21:55,455 --> 03:21:56,223
What's the during the break

3698
03:21:56,479 --> 03:21:56,991
When

3699
03:21:57,247 --> 03:22:00,575
It became apparent that you hadn't walked these videos you wouldn't try to watch this video

3700
03:22:01,343 --> 03:22:02,367
Didn't watch the whole thing

3701
03:22:04,415 --> 03:22:06,463
Cuz it's a 45-minute video right

3702
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:09,279
Yes he didn't watch the

3703
03:22:11,071 --> 03:22:13,375
Pieces of this video correct

3704
03:22:13,887 --> 03:22:16,191
How many pieces did you watch how many minutes so did you watch it

3705
03:22:16,447 --> 03:22:16,959
Video

3706
03:22:17,471 --> 03:22:17,983
Did not count

3707
03:22:18,751 --> 03:22:24,895
That's a tough thing to admit to it as a corporate representative

3708
03:22:25,407 --> 03:22:31,551
I recognized a couple hours into this deposition that I was so it under

3709
03:22:31,807 --> 03:22:37,951
Water operation that I should have done beforehand

3710
03:22:38,207 --> 03:22:41,023
So when I came into this I was

3711
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:47,423
Judging myself by Rob do standards really thought that I could do no wrong

3712
03:22:47,679 --> 03:22:51,263
Because I brought in Wikipedia articles and that was

3713
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:52,031
Exactly

3714
03:22:53,567 --> 03:22:58,687
But the but now after talking to you I'm realizing that I really should have crammed for my homework

3715
03:22:58,943 --> 03:23:04,063
Yeah I should have done something really nice

3716
03:23:04,831 --> 03:23:10,975
I watch the video during the break that was I think we'll play well

3717
03:23:13,279 --> 03:23:14,815
Jesus Christ

3718
03:23:15,327 --> 03:23:21,471
So this next judge read that right somewhere along the line

3719
03:23:21,727 --> 03:23:23,007
Line a judge is going to go

3720
03:23:23,519 --> 03:23:29,663
You tried to watch it when it's mixed with an email exchange

3721
03:23:29,919 --> 03:23:32,479
Change between Rob do in Tampa.

3722
03:23:32,735 --> 03:23:38,367
So damn batondy had wanted to get clearance for some man on the streets

3723
03:23:38,623 --> 03:23:40,927
Question do you want to do do man-on-the-street piece

3724
03:23:41,183 --> 03:23:43,231
And Rob do responded no

3725
03:23:43,743 --> 03:23:48,863
Go to Newtown cover Sandy Hook

3726
03:23:52,447 --> 03:23:57,823
Okay so what we see basically here so just a pose questions to ask random people on the street right

3727
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:03,199
Threatened and been in a follow-up email from Rob do he doesn't want Dan to do that right

3728
03:24:06,015 --> 03:24:08,319
Ryan is going to be old by the time they can Aaron

3729
03:24:09,343 --> 03:24:11,903
So he says go to Sandy Hook we will cover that

3730
03:24:12,927 --> 03:24:17,535
Intentional Choice by Mr ddr2 want to get Gambit Auntie to go to Sandy

3731
03:24:19,327 --> 03:24:19,839
Correct

3732
03:24:23,935 --> 03:24:24,959
Denature

3733
03:24:28,031 --> 03:24:28,543
The news

3734
03:24:31,103 --> 03:24:31,615
24-hour news

3735
03:24:33,151 --> 03:24:34,175
How was

3736
03:24:34,687 --> 03:24:35,199
Excuse me I'm sorry

3737
03:24:35,455 --> 03:24:40,063
Yeah how is Sandy Hook in the news on 77 2015

3738
03:24:42,879 --> 03:24:43,391
Don't have

3739
03:24:45,695 --> 03:24:46,207
Right

3740
03:24:47,487 --> 03:24:51,583
So you don't know that it had anything to do

3741
03:24:52,095 --> 03:24:52,607
Despite the fact

3742
03:24:52,863 --> 03:24:53,375
Alex

3743
03:24:54,399 --> 03:24:54,911
Have not mentioned

3744
03:24:57,727 --> 03:24:58,239
The news

3745
03:25:05,919 --> 03:25:06,431
Immediately

3746
03:25:13,855 --> 03:25:14,879
Resay purveyor

3747
03:25:15,903 --> 03:25:16,671
When you saying

3748
03:25:16,927 --> 03:25:19,231
Go to Sandy Hook we will cover that

3749
03:25:19,487 --> 03:25:20,255
Infowars

3750
03:25:20,511 --> 03:25:21,791
Is being a purveyor

3751
03:25:22,559 --> 03:25:25,887
You're almost almost three years after Sandy Hook

3752
03:25:26,143 --> 03:25:28,447
Is being a purveyor of Sandy Hook cover

3753
03:25:28,703 --> 03:25:29,215
Correct

3754
03:25:29,471 --> 03:25:29,983
No

3755
03:25:30,495 --> 03:25:34,079
What is that that is he saying that we're going to cover it and not air it

3756
03:25:34,847 --> 03:25:38,175
Your intent to put whatever Gambit on he does on the air correct

3757
03:25:42,527 --> 03:25:43,295
And then again

3758
03:25:43,551 --> 03:25:46,879
In answering this question you speculated out of thin air

3759
03:25:47,135 --> 03:25:52,511
That there was something going on around January 7th 2015 that put this in the news

3760
03:25:52,767 --> 03:25:53,279
That made it

3761
03:25:53,535 --> 03:25:54,047
Timely

3762
03:25:54,303 --> 03:25:57,119
But you that was pure speculation you have no idea what that might be

3763
03:25:57,631 --> 03:25:58,655
Correct

3764
03:25:58,911 --> 03:25:59,423
Picture of our news.

3765
03:26:02,495 --> 03:26:04,543
Yeah you're going to make news do you understand that

3766
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:07,359
You're sending down badani there to with Wolfgang halbig

3767
03:26:07,615 --> 03:26:08,383
Do you know what they did there

3768
03:26:09,919 --> 03:26:13,759
I'd like to hear that you doesn't know if I were the corporate representative I would

3769
03:26:14,015 --> 03:26:20,159
Definitely know that and I would have written some a long explanation for why it's somehow okay maybe

3770
03:26:20,415 --> 03:26:26,559
Be some kind of rationalization at very least because it's it's bad

3771
03:26:26,815 --> 03:26:32,959
Aquinas would have been proud of whatever I'd written to try and get out of that b******* cuz it takes a lot

3772
03:26:33,215 --> 03:26:39,359
Fun because I actually walking how big was harassing people at Catholic

3773
03:26:39,615 --> 03:26:45,759
Actually appropriate they were probably cistercian monks so there's another email

3774
03:26:46,015 --> 03:26:50,623
A donde that leads to a little bit of drama in the room

3775
03:26:51,135 --> 03:26:57,023
All right what we have here is from truth radio 9990 at hotmail.com

3776
03:26:57,279 --> 03:26:58,303
End

3777
03:26:59,071 --> 03:27:02,399
This was something sent to Rob do at Infowars right

3778
03:27:02,655 --> 03:27:04,959
Okay and so we have this email here

3779
03:27:05,215 --> 03:27:07,007
Dan batondy stating

3780
03:27:07,263 --> 03:27:09,055
Someone you may want to get

3781
03:27:09,311 --> 03:27:11,871
In that documentary on Sandy Hook

3782
03:27:12,639 --> 03:27:14,431
And it says forward Dan

3783
03:27:14,687 --> 03:27:18,015
Alex announced that he's going to do a Sandy Hook.

3784
03:27:18,271 --> 03:27:18,783
Film

3785
03:27:19,039 --> 03:27:22,111
Sheila Matthews who you met in Hartford At A Helbig hearing

3786
03:27:22,367 --> 03:27:24,159
Is a friend of mine who lives in the next

3787
03:27:24,415 --> 03:27:25,951
Town and I'm going to guess that says

3788
03:27:26,975 --> 03:27:31,583
We don't know what it says after that but then it says Sheila asked me to provide you with her telephone number it gets

3789
03:27:32,607 --> 03:27:33,119
Right

3790
03:27:33,631 --> 03:27:35,935
Bright and then robson's it to you

3791
03:27:36,959 --> 03:27:39,519
And this is April 24th 2018

3792
03:27:40,031 --> 03:27:43,103
And he says if Alex wants to go to Sandy Hook route

3793
03:27:43,615 --> 03:27:45,151
They want to get this lady on

3794
03:27:46,687 --> 03:27:47,199
Correct

3795
03:27:47,455 --> 03:27:50,271
Okay so this is just shortly after

3796
03:27:50,527 --> 03:27:51,295
The company was sued

3797
03:27:52,063 --> 03:27:52,575
Right

3798
03:27:55,391 --> 03:27:57,695
That's why he wants to make this documentary right

3799
03:28:01,791 --> 03:28:02,815
Not sure the exact

3800
03:28:03,327 --> 03:28:03,839
For Alex

3801
03:28:04,863 --> 03:28:06,911
What is the Sandy Hook what is that

3802
03:28:11,007 --> 03:28:17,151
Suggesting a guest and a writing an email

3803
03:28:17,407 --> 03:28:20,735
Isn't that Alex is wanting to or planning to make

3804
03:28:21,247 --> 03:28:23,295
Documentary about Sandy Hook

3805
03:28:23,551 --> 03:28:29,695
In 2018 the Sandy Hook route all right now there's not a lot of beaches in Austin but there are some

3806
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:36,095
I meant when you go to the beach all right there's sand everywhere and I don't know if you've heard about Saint sand is actually a bunch of crashed you know like

3807
03:28:36,351 --> 03:28:42,495
You could be rocket glass it could be any number of thanks and right and we were going to go fishing

3808
03:28:42,751 --> 03:28:44,287
Fishing there's a sand

3809
03:28:44,543 --> 03:28:45,567
We were going fishing

3810
03:28:45,823 --> 03:28:51,967
There's a whole working on a

3811
03:28:52,223 --> 03:28:58,367
Sort of a scene you're like sort of a a tableau decorative piece

3812
03:28:58,623 --> 03:29:04,767
It was Peter Pan vs Captain Hook all of the characters with cancer

3813
03:29:07,839 --> 03:29:13,983
Yeah that sounds like a delicious treat mat is the route

3814
03:29:14,239 --> 03:29:20,383
Generally speaking is that like

3815
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:26,783
Maybe Alex would want to have on the show as a gas right understanding that much

3816
03:29:27,039 --> 03:29:33,183
Now she's just trying to evade answering a recognizing that there was at least some

3817
03:29:33,439 --> 03:29:38,559
I'm kind of in internally discussed plan that I was wanted to make a documentary about Sandy Hook

3818
03:29:38,815 --> 03:29:39,839
In 2018

3819
03:29:40,095 --> 03:29:41,631
And the damper dondi was sending

3820
03:29:41,887 --> 03:29:45,983
Sources the question about the funding sources

3821
03:29:46,495 --> 03:29:48,799
This is where things that go off the rails

3822
03:29:49,311 --> 03:29:50,847
If Rob do was sending

3823
03:29:51,103 --> 03:29:51,615
To you

3824
03:29:52,383 --> 03:29:54,175
A source from Dan Vaden

3825
03:29:54,943 --> 03:29:55,967
The truth Warrior

3826
03:29:56,479 --> 03:29:58,271
We can be fairly certain

3827
03:29:58,783 --> 03:29:59,807
But that guest

3828
03:30:00,319 --> 03:30:02,623
Was going to support the idea that Sandy Hook was

3829
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:06,207
Assumption

3830
03:30:07,231 --> 03:30:07,999
Don't answer that question

3831
03:30:09,023 --> 03:30:11,583
Why not because that's extremely misleading

3832
03:30:12,095 --> 03:30:18,239
That's not a proper basis to objective had been added into the rule

3833
03:30:18,495 --> 03:30:19,519
Can you read my question back

3834
03:30:20,031 --> 03:30:25,151
So it's pretty clear that the reason that this was a question that if you can pull off

3835
03:30:25,407 --> 03:30:31,551
Are you don't want to your client answer you don't need to know about that

3836
03:30:31,807 --> 03:30:37,951
To be suggesting of gas but for him to send Gaston the subject of Sandy Hook reference

3837
03:30:38,463 --> 03:30:44,351
I meant for Rob to forward that on to Dari at that indicate that there was internal action being taken on batondy suggestion

3838
03:30:44,863 --> 03:30:49,215
It wasn't just something that they ignored like they want to pretend they always do with Stanford

3839
03:30:49,471 --> 03:30:55,615
Get 10000 emails a day obligation is clearly that there was an interest in interviewing guests who would support

3840
03:30:55,871 --> 03:30:57,919
Did the Sandy Hook was a hoax narrative

3841
03:30:58,175 --> 03:30:59,967
After Alex got sued

3842
03:31:00,223 --> 03:31:06,367
In the case and that's why Brad the lawyer is saying don't answer that question

3843
03:31:16,095 --> 03:31:16,607
Sandy Hook

3844
03:31:19,423 --> 03:31:20,959
Have her answer the question removed

3845
03:31:22,751 --> 03:31:26,079
I will I will move to composite answer that if you're having or not answer that question

3846
03:31:26,335 --> 03:31:27,615
It's very clear what you're trying to hide

3847
03:31:28,639 --> 03:31:29,663
I wanted a divorce

3848
03:31:32,479 --> 03:31:33,247
I don't appreciate the

3849
03:31:33,503 --> 03:31:37,343
That's where I'm at is a threat and I don't really appreciate it

3850
03:31:38,111 --> 03:31:38,623
You know what

3851
03:31:38,879 --> 03:31:40,415
Look at where we are in this case

3852
03:31:40,671 --> 03:31:43,487
Go ahead and if you know the answer to question proceed with answering the question

3853
03:31:44,511 --> 03:31:46,047
I get sent a lot of guests

3854
03:31:46,559 --> 03:31:47,071
Daily basis

3855
03:31:48,351 --> 03:31:49,119
There's no way

3856
03:31:50,911 --> 03:31:51,935
For me to know this

3857
03:31:53,215 --> 03:31:53,727
Would be

3858
03:31:56,543 --> 03:31:57,055
Pro

3859
03:31:58,079 --> 03:31:58,847
Sandy Hook

3860
03:32:06,271 --> 03:32:07,295
No idea

3861
03:32:07,551 --> 03:32:10,879
I don't think that's that's a reliable answer

3862
03:32:13,183 --> 03:32:19,327
Fine it'll just look that just looks like obfuscation

3863
03:32:19,583 --> 03:32:24,191
What Brad's up to I mean maybe Brad's just like I got to make it look like a

3864
03:32:24,447 --> 03:32:25,727
Working because

3865
03:32:25,983 --> 03:32:28,543
If I was Brad I'm just looking at H man

3866
03:32:28,799 --> 03:32:34,943
I think he gets the implication of answering that question and if you can if you can pull off and

3867
03:32:35,199 --> 03:32:35,967
Objection there

3868
03:32:36,223 --> 03:32:39,295
You might want to totally crucial again

3869
03:32:39,551 --> 03:32:45,695
You're going to be fired in like a month or two if past is Prelude Alex's lawyers

3870
03:32:45,951 --> 03:32:51,839
Not long on the job

3871
03:32:52,095 --> 03:32:53,631
Come on man

3872
03:32:53,887 --> 03:32:56,191
We both know what's going on here

3873
03:32:56,703 --> 03:32:57,727
So

3874
03:32:58,239 --> 03:33:01,567
This leads to an assessment

3875
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:06,431
Of how badonde what is he up to

3876
03:33:07,455 --> 03:33:09,503
You know what Danville. He believes about Sandy Hook don't you

3877
03:33:10,527 --> 03:33:11,807
You personally d'arrigo Provo

3878
03:33:12,575 --> 03:33:13,087
You don't know

3879
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:19,999
No as an Infowars producer here to testify his behalf of the company you also didn't do anything to prepare to know what Dan Vuitton

3880
03:33:20,511 --> 03:33:23,071
Right that's not part of the topics you were asked to talk about today

3881
03:33:23,583 --> 03:33:24,095
I know David

3882
03:33:33,311 --> 03:33:33,823
You

3883
03:33:34,079 --> 03:33:35,615
You were testifying here right now

3884
03:33:35,871 --> 03:33:40,223
Damn it. He's a good reporter

3885
03:33:41,247 --> 03:33:42,527
Insofar as him trying to

3886
03:33:43,295 --> 03:33:43,807
What happened

3887
03:33:47,135 --> 03:33:49,951
You seen any videos of Damage Done in Connecticut and what he did

3888
03:33:50,463 --> 03:33:51,231
You're watching

3889
03:33:52,767 --> 03:33:56,607
You might not be the best person to qualify to talk about whether dammit. He was a good reporter in Utah

3890
03:33:57,119 --> 03:33:59,167
Objection forms not what she said

3891
03:33:59,423 --> 03:34:01,471
That's what I'm asking her a question bro

3892
03:34:01,983 --> 03:34:03,007
I'm asking you

3893
03:34:03,263 --> 03:34:05,823
You may not be the best qualified person

3894
03:34:06,079 --> 03:34:08,127
To talk about what Dan to Donnie did in Newton

3895
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:09,151
Correct

3896
03:34:09,663 --> 03:34:10,687
You'd arika Provo

3897
03:34:14,015 --> 03:34:14,527
My definition

3898
03:34:23,743 --> 03:34:28,607
So you don't you can do but you can admit to me right now you don't know what them. Need it in Utah

3899
03:34:36,031 --> 03:34:40,895
Do you know about Saint Rose of Lima Catholic School in Newtown for debit on the other Wolfgang hybrid there

3900
03:34:43,455 --> 03:34:49,343
Casa Catholic School in question Priceless almost like

3901
03:34:49,599 --> 03:34:51,903
The corporate representative being unaware of

3902
03:34:52,159 --> 03:34:54,463
What damper. He did but also saying that

3903
03:34:54,719 --> 03:34:57,535
She's great reporter reporter

3904
03:34:57,791 --> 03:35:03,935
Cuz you can just play he's a great reporter and then show the footage of him yelling at people

3905
03:35:04,191 --> 03:35:10,335
Newtown I mean I assume they think that's what a great reporter does I think so persistent

3906
03:35:10,591 --> 03:35:13,663
Yeah they're very very shallow people

3907
03:35:13,919 --> 03:35:18,271
So one of the questions in this case is regarding whether or not

3908
03:35:18,527 --> 03:35:19,807
The

3909
03:35:20,063 --> 03:35:20,575
Sandy Hook

3910
03:35:20,831 --> 03:35:26,975
What kind of materials were used strategically in terms of marketing

3911
03:35:27,231 --> 03:35:28,511
Absolutely not

3912
03:35:29,279 --> 03:35:34,911
Has Infowars when making its editorial discussions and decisions

3913
03:35:35,167 --> 03:35:36,447
About the Sandy Hook cover

3914
03:35:37,471 --> 03:35:39,519
Has it ever attempted to use at Sandy Hook

3915
03:35:40,031 --> 03:35:40,543
Story

3916
03:35:40,799 --> 03:35:41,311
Videos

3917
03:35:42,079 --> 03:35:43,359
In a strategic way

3918
03:35:44,383 --> 03:35:46,175
To attract viewers

3919
03:35:49,247 --> 03:35:50,271
The idea that we would

3920
03:35:51,039 --> 03:35:53,343
Make some video uploads about Sandy hookers

3921
03:35:53,599 --> 03:35:54,367
Strategic measure

3922
03:35:55,647 --> 03:35:56,927
That's not something that

3923
03:35:58,463 --> 03:35:59,231
Would be a

3924
03:36:00,511 --> 03:36:02,303
Would be a part of Infowars editorialist

3925
03:36:03,327 --> 03:36:04,095
Never

3926
03:36:04,351 --> 03:36:05,119
Never okay

3927
03:36:05,375 --> 03:36:06,143
Never

3928
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:09,215
All right so I'm a quarterback in the pocket

3929
03:36:09,471 --> 03:36:15,615
I'm starting to feel pressure all the sudden I'm starting to see the defensive end running straight towards my

3930
03:36:15,871 --> 03:36:22,015
The question is not a common happy question that is going to end with your answer be accepted is okay it's a

3931
03:36:22,271 --> 03:36:28,415
You don't have a football and all the rules have been lifted

3932
03:36:28,671 --> 03:36:33,279
There is no offensive line get your ass kicked

3933
03:36:34,047 --> 03:36:35,839
Crusader marked as exhibit 15

3934
03:36:39,423 --> 03:36:42,495
Can you tell me who the top here it will actually make sure that the bottom

3935
03:36:42,751 --> 03:36:45,567
At the bottom corner you see this Mark says ffs

3936
03:36:45,823 --> 03:36:46,335
T-Rex

3937
03:36:46,591 --> 03:36:47,871
Dash 07

3938
03:36:48,127 --> 03:36:49,151
60-69

3939
03:36:50,943 --> 03:36:55,295
No can you tell me first let's just look at the top of the email who is Darren

3940
03:36:56,063 --> 03:36:56,575
Danny McBride

3941
03:36:56,831 --> 03:36:58,879
Through his title in 2015 do you know

3942
03:37:01,183 --> 03:37:01,695
Editor

3943
03:37:01,951 --> 03:37:03,743
Okay and Rob do we talked about correct

3944
03:37:04,767 --> 03:37:06,303
Louis we talked about right

3945
03:37:07,071 --> 03:37:09,119
Okay the next other person that's on here is Travis Knight

3946
03:37:09,375 --> 03:37:10,143
You know that person is

3947
03:37:10,655 --> 03:37:13,215
I'm going to end you know what their job position is

3948
03:37:14,495 --> 03:37:15,519
And then

3949
03:37:15,775 --> 03:37:16,287
This

3950
03:37:17,567 --> 03:37:21,407
Emails being sent from Lewes to Travis Knight Rob do and Darren

3951
03:37:21,663 --> 03:37:22,431
And the subject

3952
03:37:22,687 --> 03:37:24,735
Is video files for Facebook upload

3953
03:37:24,991 --> 03:37:26,783
On September 24th 2015

3954
03:37:27,039 --> 03:37:27,551
That's correct

3955
03:37:28,063 --> 03:37:28,831
Yes

3956
03:37:29,087 --> 03:37:30,111
He asked them

3957
03:37:30,367 --> 03:37:36,511
Can I get these video files for future strategic Facebook upload correct

3958
03:37:36,767 --> 03:37:41,887
One of the files that he is asking for is why people think Sandy Hooks is a hoax correct

3959
03:37:48,031 --> 03:37:49,567
So we can tell from this email

3960
03:37:50,079 --> 03:37:52,639
Denton and Darren follows up and says any luck finding

3961
03:37:53,151 --> 03:37:53,663
Correct

3962
03:37:53,919 --> 03:37:57,759
Yes we can agree from this email that editor Darren and Louie s

3963
03:37:58,015 --> 03:37:59,551
We're attempting to use

3964
03:37:59,807 --> 03:38:02,111
A video about Sandy Hook being a hoax

3965
03:38:02,367 --> 03:38:04,927
As a future strategic Facebook upload

3966
03:38:05,183 --> 03:38:05,695
Correct

3967
03:38:06,463 --> 03:38:07,487
It's one of the video

3968
03:38:07,743 --> 03:38:09,279
Videos out of 8 videos

3969
03:38:10,303 --> 03:38:15,423
Sure so it is one of the videos being used for a future strategic Facebook upload correct

3970
03:38:15,679 --> 03:38:16,447
Objection form

3971
03:38:20,543 --> 03:38:21,311
Yes

3972
03:38:21,567 --> 03:38:27,711
But won't you consider that it wasn't just a second was a stripper

3973
03:38:27,967 --> 03:38:34,111
Well I mean like I think obviously you ask the question with the word strategic and

3974
03:38:34,367 --> 03:38:40,511
Yeah cuz you know that

3975
03:38:40,767 --> 03:38:43,839
Preparing well I would I just would never have expected

3976
03:38:44,095 --> 03:38:50,239
Them to really have used the right I think that at a certain point there probably wasn't a cancer

3977
03:38:50,495 --> 03:38:56,639
Now they just didn't give a f*** amazing

3978
03:38:56,895 --> 03:38:58,431
Of Wolfgang halbig

3979
03:38:58,687 --> 03:39:04,831
Cuz obviously he's a source for a lot of the stuff

3980
03:39:05,087 --> 03:39:11,231
It's probably just how big stuff that you brought

3981
03:39:11,487 --> 03:39:16,095
Word for word let's go on to talk about Wolfgang halbig would you mind opening up your blue folder for me

3982
03:39:21,215 --> 03:39:22,495
You see that article on top

3983
03:39:23,007 --> 03:39:27,615
Destiny brought today and you were talking about how much you were talking about like you wanted to read it

3984
03:39:28,639 --> 03:39:29,407
Today right

3985
03:39:29,663 --> 03:39:32,223
To talk about Wolfgang's qualifications

3986
03:39:35,039 --> 03:39:36,575
So this article that you brought

3987
03:39:37,087 --> 03:39:39,391
Is what you believe you is

3988
03:39:39,647 --> 03:39:40,415
Let me ask you this

3989
03:39:40,927 --> 03:39:47,071
Is that something that Infowars had before you went look for it for your deposition or is that something that you got for your deposition to help

3990
03:39:47,327 --> 03:39:47,839
Buick

3991
03:39:49,631 --> 03:39:50,143
The ladder

3992
03:39:50,399 --> 03:39:50,911
Okay

3993
03:39:51,423 --> 03:39:55,263
So before this deposition Infowars did not have this document in its corporate

3994
03:39:58,591 --> 03:39:59,871
Correct the files that I looked

3995
03:40:00,127 --> 03:40:00,639
Throughout

3996
03:40:01,151 --> 03:40:02,175
Search for

3997
03:40:02,431 --> 03:40:03,199
Bayou

3998
03:40:04,991 --> 03:40:06,015
As well as

3999
03:40:07,295 --> 03:40:08,063
Stephen memory hold on

4000
03:40:09,599 --> 03:40:10,111
Article

4001
03:40:11,391 --> 03:40:11,903
Archive

4002
03:40:12,415 --> 03:40:12,927
What

4003
03:40:14,463 --> 03:40:15,231
I'm sorry what

4004
03:40:15,487 --> 03:40:16,255
He listed his bio

4005
03:40:16,767 --> 03:40:19,327
Did you go try to search Wolfgang, Google did you do that

4006
03:40:19,839 --> 03:40:25,727
Okay and so when you say good memory hold I take it you're ignoring the dozens of mainstream articles about

4007
03:40:26,495 --> 03:40:28,799
You don't want to use the mainstream articles

4008
03:40:29,055 --> 03:40:29,823
Specifically

4009
03:40:30,591 --> 03:40:31,103
Bionicle

4010
03:40:32,639 --> 03:40:35,199
Okay there are mainstream articles that talk about Wolfgang's

4011
03:40:35,455 --> 03:40:36,479
Credentials or

4012
03:40:37,247 --> 03:40:38,527
Is electrode intros right

4013
03:40:39,039 --> 03:40:39,807
Did you see any of those

4014
03:40:40,575 --> 03:40:42,367
I've looked at many of them and I did not

4015
03:40:42,623 --> 03:40:43,903
See an actual

4016
03:40:44,671 --> 03:40:45,439
Biography

4017
03:40:47,231 --> 03:40:47,743
His accomplishment

4018
03:40:47,999 --> 03:40:48,511
Okay

4019
03:40:50,815 --> 03:40:54,143
Instead this exhibit 1f

4020
03:40:54,655 --> 03:40:56,447
Written by dr. Pol

4021
03:40:56,959 --> 03:40:57,727
You know who that is

4022
03:40:59,263 --> 03:41:02,847
I did not I didn't bring it for the author I brought it for the

4023
03:41:03,103 --> 03:41:03,871
Bio-data

4024
03:41:05,663 --> 03:41:08,991
So now if you're sitting there you have brought this

4025
03:41:09,247 --> 03:41:10,783
Yeah and if

4026
03:41:11,039 --> 03:41:15,135
Do you know the name dr. Yuan for example is pretty

4027
03:41:15,903 --> 03:41:21,279
Detailed look at small detail of this thing that's being brought up you probably should maybe recognize

4028
03:41:21,535 --> 03:41:27,679
It's for real no I would be like hold on can I have that document real quick and then shred it

4029
03:41:27,935 --> 03:41:28,447
Absolutely

4030
03:41:28,703 --> 03:41:33,055
You can't prove s*** man cuz there's bad news about this

4031
03:41:33,567 --> 03:41:34,591
Do you have any face

4032
03:41:34,847 --> 03:41:38,431
Sitting here today that the information contained in that article is accurate

4033
03:41:40,223 --> 03:41:41,247
Yes because even the people

4034
03:41:41,503 --> 03:41:42,527
Who disagree with Wolfgang

4035
03:41:42,783 --> 03:41:43,295
Can how big

4036
03:41:44,575 --> 03:41:45,087
Admit

4037
03:41:45,343 --> 03:41:46,623
That he has a lengthy

4038
03:41:47,903 --> 03:41:48,671
Who said that

4039
03:41:49,183 --> 03:41:49,951
I've read it

4040
03:41:51,231 --> 03:41:51,743
Indifferent

4041
03:41:52,767 --> 03:41:57,631
I thought you said his body was the memory

4042
03:41:58,655 --> 03:41:59,423
Acknowledged

4043
03:41:59,935 --> 03:42:00,703
Antibiotics

4044
03:42:00,959 --> 03:42:01,471
That violet

4045
03:42:01,983 --> 03:42:02,495
Cupboard

4046
03:42:03,263 --> 03:42:04,543
But I could not find the app

4047
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:05,311
Natural biotic

4048
03:42:05,567 --> 03:42:09,151
Accurate mean to you think it's covered accurately there

4049
03:42:09,663 --> 03:42:10,943
That's what you think

4050
03:42:12,479 --> 03:42:15,551
Okay and the person who wrote that doctor you in do you know who that is

4051
03:42:16,319 --> 03:42:18,367
Don't have a last name right

4052
03:42:18,623 --> 03:42:19,135
The person who wrote

4053
03:42:19,391 --> 03:42:21,183
Go back and look at the first page

4054
03:42:23,743 --> 03:42:25,279
Understand the article was supposed

4055
03:42:26,047 --> 03:42:26,559
Bye

4056
03:42:27,071 --> 03:42:27,583
Said Doctor

4057
03:42:28,351 --> 03:42:29,375
Did you win

4058
03:42:31,423 --> 03:42:32,447
The Bayou

4059
03:42:32,703 --> 03:42:33,215
That's been

4060
03:42:35,519 --> 03:42:37,567
You started here at 7 type 2

4061
03:42:37,823 --> 03:42:39,359
Screenshot

4062
03:42:39,871 --> 03:42:40,895
From where

4063
03:42:42,431 --> 03:42:43,199
A boy

4064
03:42:43,455 --> 03:42:44,479
I do not have the source

4065
03:42:44,991 --> 03:42:46,015
Exact Source where was

4066
03:42:47,039 --> 03:42:47,551
Printed from

4067
03:42:47,807 --> 03:42:49,855
You have no idea where that came from

4068
03:42:50,111 --> 03:42:54,463
People who disagree with how they can who criticizes admit that his

4069
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:55,487
Biotin

4070
03:42:56,255 --> 03:42:59,839
I am still waiting to see that do you have any information you can point me to that

4071
03:43:00,095 --> 03:43:05,215
Anybody you say who's an opponent of albuq who admits that he has an impressive bio

4072
03:43:05,471 --> 03:43:06,495
Those documents

4073
03:43:06,751 --> 03:43:07,519
That's what I

4074
03:43:07,775 --> 03:43:09,311
Thought I needed for you but

4075
03:43:09,567 --> 03:43:12,127
Instead faction I did the research

4076
03:43:12,383 --> 03:43:13,407
Into my satisfaction

4077
03:43:13,663 --> 03:43:14,431
Does bio

4078
03:43:15,711 --> 03:43:21,855
Text out let's talk about what's currently a screenshot that you cannot identify where it came

4079
03:43:22,111 --> 03:43:24,927
From printed an article by dr. Aon

4080
03:43:25,183 --> 03:43:27,231
Who did you who first what that's

4081
03:43:35,423 --> 03:43:41,567
Did you know that the doctor that you Uber

4082
03:43:42,079 --> 03:43:42,847
Into here

4083
03:43:43,103 --> 03:43:49,247
Is only good for my case wrote a chapter of Jim Panthers book

4084
03:43:49,503 --> 03:43:55,647
You want to be more closely associated with Jim Fetzer

4085
03:43:55,903 --> 03:44:01,279
The more trouble for yourself by bringing this biome has

4086
03:44:01,791 --> 03:44:05,119
Double-decker of deposition the yeah

4087
03:44:05,375 --> 03:44:11,519
So I'm going to skip a couple of Clips here because they're long and they actually achieve

4088
03:44:11,775 --> 03:44:14,335
In all of these and that is a

4089
03:44:14,591 --> 03:44:20,735
If you'd known that how big was a bad Source right would you have acted on it early

4090
03:44:20,991 --> 03:44:27,135
Bruno and then of course bark produces an email from March 2014

4091
03:44:27,391 --> 03:44:33,535
This is no good and then a Don Salazar responding to the guy

4092
03:44:33,791 --> 03:44:38,399
There's there's interaction with this person who clearly bringing up before

4093
03:44:38,655 --> 03:44:44,799
They stopped having him on the show that he appears to be full of s*** right and then they did nothing they took no action on

4094
03:44:45,055 --> 03:44:48,895
Nitrite didn't double-check his credentials or like whether he was a reliable source

4095
03:44:49,407 --> 03:44:52,479
I mean it looks bad but it's

4096
03:44:52,735 --> 03:44:56,575
Kind of a bunch happen in these depositions feels like

4097
03:44:57,087 --> 03:44:59,647
And this is what is getting into my head

4098
03:44:59,903 --> 03:45:00,927
It feels like

4099
03:45:01,951 --> 03:45:08,095
Neither Alex nor endless space it does not understand that when they are in a day

4100
03:45:08,351 --> 03:45:08,863
Deposition

4101
03:45:09,631 --> 03:45:12,447
The plaintiff is not asking them questions

4102
03:45:13,215 --> 03:45:19,359
For fun

4103
03:45:19,615 --> 03:45:25,759
This is not because they know the answers

4104
03:45:26,015 --> 03:45:29,855
The deposition is for you to say something dumb bulshit

4105
03:45:30,111 --> 03:45:36,255
And you're doing that yes and oh my God oh my God

4106
03:45:36,511 --> 03:45:42,655
Emails from Wolfgang that were harassing Sandy Hook

4107
03:45:42,911 --> 03:45:49,055
Alex responded to them

4108
03:45:49,823 --> 03:45:51,103
Mel lipsey

4109
03:45:52,127 --> 03:45:53,407
Daria does

4110
03:45:53,663 --> 03:45:59,807
This first one is about the 30 school email daughter go to school

4111
03:46:00,063 --> 03:46:01,599
Here's Daria steak on it

4112
03:46:02,367 --> 03:46:03,903
Okay so first of all

4113
03:46:04,159 --> 03:46:06,719
How do you how does the company feel about this email

4114
03:46:09,279 --> 03:46:10,559
Inform what's your objective

4115
03:46:11,327 --> 03:46:11,839
Vague

4116
03:46:12,095 --> 03:46:12,863
How come you feel

4117
03:46:13,119 --> 03:46:14,911
Feelings

4118
03:46:17,215 --> 03:46:18,751
Good work friends

4119
03:46:23,103 --> 03:46:23,615
Asking

4120
03:46:24,383 --> 03:46:24,895
Seems to be

4121
03:46:25,151 --> 03:46:25,919
Concerned

4122
03:46:26,943 --> 03:46:27,455
Wellbeing list

4123
03:46:27,711 --> 03:46:28,223
Child

4124
03:46:28,991 --> 03:46:29,759
Thank you Moscato

4125
03:46:31,295 --> 03:46:34,623
Actually I want to read this email to the records we can talk about it okay

4126
03:46:34,879 --> 03:46:36,671
Mr Hamid rights Michelle

4127
03:46:36,927 --> 03:46:43,071
How can you and your husband as responsible parent even allow your precious child Josephine to attend that

4128
03:46:43,327 --> 03:46:46,655
Filthy and deplorable looking school on December 14th 2012

4129
03:46:46,911 --> 03:46:53,055
The marker even afterwards because she was responding to having read it to herself she was like silently reading it

4130
03:46:53,311 --> 03:46:59,455
That was wild is all the way through

4131
03:46:59,711 --> 03:47:03,807
Amex only become clear if they're being asked about the same documents

4132
03:47:04,063 --> 03:47:06,623
You know it's it's it's really weird

4133
03:47:06,879 --> 03:47:13,023
Where how big is harassing his parabatai filthy the school was is

4134
03:47:13,279 --> 03:47:16,607
It sounds like a person who's concerned about the well-being of the child

4135
03:47:16,863 --> 03:47:22,751
It's just so great to know that someone cares while Alex reads it is Invictus custard

4136
03:47:23,263 --> 03:47:26,591
There's a couple things that I can think of that might explain these different responses

4137
03:47:26,847 --> 03:47:32,735
The first is that they may have prepared for the depositions differently so Alex might have been slightly more prepared

4138
03:47:32,991 --> 03:47:37,855
2nd to the possibility that Alex has at least a modicum of emotional intelligence and CapTel

4139
03:47:38,111 --> 03:47:44,255
But he's supposed to not make excuses for an email like that wears darya's Justin like cover-your-ass and deflect mode

4140
03:47:45,023 --> 03:47:51,167
I was thinking about this or as I call it researching in my mind I think they came up another possibility

4141
03:47:51,423 --> 03:47:57,567
This feels like maybe it's connected to Dara's bizarre comments about it being a function of optimism to promote

4142
03:47:57,823 --> 03:48:03,967
Call the idea that the children from Sandy Hook was still alive

4143
03:48:04,223 --> 03:48:10,367
No one with a heart would want to believe that Wolfgang halbig was an almost Cartoon Level assholes that is free time Horizon

4144
03:48:10,623 --> 03:48:16,767
Anyone with a heart would want to believe that he's just very concerned about the janitorial staff at the school

4145
03:48:17,279 --> 03:48:22,911
Yet another option I considered as that it's really difficult as an emotional thing to confront near to see

4146
03:48:23,167 --> 03:48:28,799
The actions in the real world of a person who you were an active participant in promoting

4147
03:48:29,055 --> 03:48:35,199
When you see that he was harassing and stalking these parents and you know that you're not working all your co-workers were whitewashing his

4148
03:48:35,455 --> 03:48:41,599
Patience raising money for him and effectively enabling his behavior that's got to be a bit of a gut punch

4149
03:48:41,855 --> 03:48:44,415
I can kind of see why you might want to pretend it's not real

4150
03:48:44,671 --> 03:48:46,207
Here's my take on

4151
03:48:46,463 --> 03:48:48,767
Cuz I I see where you're coming from

4152
03:48:49,023 --> 03:48:55,167
And I'm going to be far less generous

4153
03:48:55,423 --> 03:48:57,471
Lives are roles

4154
03:48:57,983 --> 03:48:59,007
I I see it

4155
03:48:59,263 --> 03:49:00,287
More like

4156
03:49:02,335 --> 03:49:03,871
In order to be the host

4157
03:49:04,127 --> 03:49:06,687
Write in order to be on screen

4158
03:49:06,943 --> 03:49:08,735
In order to attract an audience

4159
03:49:08,991 --> 03:49:12,319
People have to be able to make an emotional connection

4160
03:49:12,575 --> 03:49:13,343
They have to

4161
03:49:13,599 --> 03:49:14,367
So

4162
03:49:14,623 --> 03:49:20,767
Whether or not you are a true psychopath or whatever it is you want to say at the very least you have

4163
03:49:21,023 --> 03:49:27,167
To have the emotional ability to evoke emotion with Alex all the time with faking crying and

4164
03:49:27,423 --> 03:49:29,727
And I would save it

4165
03:49:29,983 --> 03:49:31,263
To work

4166
03:49:31,519 --> 03:49:32,287
With Alex

4167
03:49:32,799 --> 03:49:36,639
It would require a an abdication of

4168
03:49:36,895 --> 03:49:38,431
General human

4169
03:49:38,687 --> 03:49:44,319
Sympathy and empathy entirely that would kind of make sense why Dari has never been an on-air personality

4170
03:49:44,575 --> 03:49:50,719
I mean the one I think about it the more I think about people like you know listening to Dari is deposition I think about

4171
03:49:50,975 --> 03:49:52,511
F****** Tucker Carlson

4172
03:49:52,767 --> 03:49:53,279
You know like

4173
03:49:53,535 --> 03:49:57,631
Tucker Carlson can go on his show and if he didn't have editorial people

4174
03:49:57,887 --> 03:49:58,655
Stopping him

4175
03:49:58,911 --> 03:49:59,423
He could

4176
03:49:59,679 --> 03:50:01,215
Easily

4177
03:50:01,471 --> 03:50:07,359
Easily do all the same Alex s*** he's just got a bigger network with people reining him in

4178
03:50:07,615 --> 03:50:09,407
And those people

4179
03:50:09,919 --> 03:50:10,431
AR

4180
03:50:10,687 --> 03:50:16,831
Psychos like it's the only way that you can work with a f***** like Tucker Carlson

4181
03:50:17,343 --> 03:50:18,879
And not kill yourself

4182
03:50:19,135 --> 03:50:25,023
So I think Daria is just a stone-cold f****** psychopath you can say that and you mean like

4183
03:50:25,279 --> 03:50:28,095
Obviously you're violating the Goldwater rule

4184
03:50:28,351 --> 03:50:33,983
I think that some of these answers and you know this trend that you see of like

4185
03:50:34,239 --> 03:50:35,007
Kind of

4186
03:50:35,775 --> 03:50:38,335
Hey what if we pretend everything is good

4187
03:50:38,591 --> 03:50:43,711
I think that it's it's a bizarre way to engage with the world

4188
03:50:44,223 --> 03:50:44,991
And

4189
03:50:45,247 --> 03:50:51,135
It does kind of at least speak to that difference that that dynamic

4190
03:50:51,647 --> 03:50:54,463
Alex knows what is expected of him

4191
03:50:54,719 --> 03:50:58,303
Right to appear normal

4192
03:50:58,559 --> 03:51:04,703
Doesn't care

4193
03:51:04,959 --> 03:51:10,079
I should be out a job she will be out of a job that was going to happen anyway probably

4194
03:51:10,335 --> 03:51:16,479
So now we get her response to the email about the stocking where how big showed up at these people's house

4195
03:51:16,735 --> 03:51:21,855
And was talking about talking to their neighbors right I wonder what her responses

4196
03:51:22,623 --> 03:51:23,647
3 million creepy

4197
03:51:24,159 --> 03:51:24,671
You personally

4198
03:51:34,655 --> 03:51:39,519
Done preview out to have Wolfgang halbig showing up these peoples houses and describing a three-car garage and all that stuff

4199
03:51:40,031 --> 03:51:41,567
Accusing them of being people or not

4200
03:51:41,823 --> 03:51:43,871
Actually aren't that doesn't Ellen Avenue

4201
03:51:44,383 --> 03:51:46,175
Yami strong feelings one way or another.

4202
03:51:48,223 --> 03:51:48,735
Jackson storm

4203
03:52:01,791 --> 03:52:02,303
Are you asking

4204
03:52:03,071 --> 03:52:04,351
Yeah your personal opinion

4205
03:52:05,375 --> 03:52:06,655
Strike me the passion man who

4206
03:52:06,911 --> 03:52:08,447
Who's doing investigation something to eat

4207
03:52:09,471 --> 03:52:09,983
Don Hardin

4208
03:52:13,055 --> 03:52:13,567
Capella

4209
03:52:13,823 --> 03:52:19,967
That's a bike down

4210
03:52:20,223 --> 03:52:25,343
Lowe's give to f****** Congress are willing to watch the humanity

4211
03:52:25,599 --> 03:52:31,743
We don't give a f*** response thank you

4212
03:52:31,999 --> 03:52:38,143
Almost like you can tell the to containing of elation can't believe you said something that's going to be so

4213
03:52:38,399 --> 03:52:40,191
So damaged

4214
03:52:40,447 --> 03:52:46,591
Refusing to see like these negative things how big did

4215
03:52:46,847 --> 03:52:52,991
The other email was concerned about the cleanliness of the school on this one

4216
03:52:53,247 --> 03:52:58,623
Rationalize that I think it probably feels like good spin at the moment but this is a huge mistake

4217
03:52:58,879 --> 03:53:02,719
Cuz it a deposition setting you need to be considering that your words are going to be played for a jury

4218
03:53:02,975 --> 03:53:05,791
You should account for them having basic human emotions

4219
03:53:06,303 --> 03:53:11,423
Anyone in the jury who reads or hears that email is going to be disgusted by how big's actions because

4220
03:53:11,935 --> 03:53:18,079
Clearly man stalking grieving families and when they see you making excuses for it or characterizing it as just

4221
03:53:18,335 --> 03:53:19,359
Passionate investigator

4222
03:53:19,615 --> 03:53:21,663
That's going to look really bad for you

4223
03:53:21,919 --> 03:53:25,759
Is it gives the strong impression that you're either lying to cover something up or maybe

4224
03:53:26,015 --> 03:53:30,879
You actually don't think that how big stocking these families was that bad a thing for him to have done

4225
03:53:31,391 --> 03:53:37,535
Suspicion that Alex is smart enough to realize that Dynamic which could help explain why he had the responses to this email

4226
03:53:37,791 --> 03:53:43,679
Mel's it's congruent with how you would want the jury to see you and and how you know the jury is going to respond to them

4227
03:53:43,935 --> 03:53:47,007
And I don't even necessarily know where like

4228
03:53:47,519 --> 03:53:50,847
That's a conscious decision but it might just be like Alex gets fat

4229
03:53:51,103 --> 03:53:56,223
I love the way that Mark set up easy emails because you could have

4230
03:53:56,479 --> 03:54:01,599
You could have set it up in a different in a different fashion and made some different points but I just love the fact that it's

4231
03:54:01,855 --> 03:54:07,999
It's like a limbo bar for empathy that he keeps raising you know like that first one if you don't see that

4232
03:54:08,255 --> 03:54:09,791
That is monstrous you know

4233
03:54:10,047 --> 03:54:16,191
Wow you just smacked the f****** limbo bar then raises the limbo bar 5015

4234
03:54:16,447 --> 03:54:22,591
True monsters behavior and she's like I bet I can hit that barb is really just asking

4235
03:54:22,847 --> 03:54:28,991
Yes hey you know if somebody were lit on fire that would be a bad thing right

4236
03:54:29,247 --> 03:54:35,391
You agree with that damn so there's a bunch of questions that come up about 3

4237
03:54:35,647 --> 03:54:39,487
The size of the audience metrics and and traffic

4238
03:54:39,743 --> 03:54:45,887
Basically boils down to Daria having like I didn't do anything to figure out

4239
03:54:46,399 --> 03:54:47,935
Great

4240
03:54:48,191 --> 03:54:50,751
We're hours into this deposition

4241
03:54:51,007 --> 03:54:53,311
This question is damning

4242
03:54:53,823 --> 03:54:55,871
You understand the company produced documents

4243
03:54:56,639 --> 03:54:57,663
From its own corporate file

4244
03:54:58,687 --> 03:55:03,039
Okay and you understand that some of those document request ask for documents about

4245
03:55:03,295 --> 03:55:03,807
Mypoints

4246
03:55:06,367 --> 03:55:07,391
Can you name

4247
03:55:09,183 --> 03:55:10,463
My forklift you know there

4248
03:55:14,303 --> 03:55:17,375
It's on the notice I know yummy from memory you don't

4249
03:55:17,631 --> 03:55:18,399
You got to pull this

4250
03:55:21,727 --> 03:55:23,263
Corporate representative

4251
03:55:23,519 --> 03:55:25,567
You don't know the names of the people suing you

4252
03:55:26,335 --> 03:55:28,639
Board games

4253
03:55:28,895 --> 03:55:29,919
Do you know why we're here

4254
03:55:30,175 --> 03:55:36,319
It's rank disrespect to not even take this seriously enough to know like even if you don't want to know their name

4255
03:55:36,575 --> 03:55:40,415
Names as people be aware of the names of the cases right

4256
03:55:40,671 --> 03:55:41,951
You know I mean

4257
03:55:42,207 --> 03:55:43,743
This is one of those things

4258
03:55:45,023 --> 03:55:46,815
It's it's easy to laugh

4259
03:55:47,327 --> 03:55:52,191
At how terrible they are in these depositions you know it is very easy

4260
03:55:52,447 --> 03:55:58,591
Cuz they're garbage and they're they're just dumb on a on an astronomical scale but when you do hear that

4261
03:55:59,103 --> 03:56:01,919
It just it reminds me all over again like

4262
03:56:02,431 --> 03:56:05,503
That's why it's fine for them that's why they don't care

4263
03:56:05,759 --> 03:56:06,783
Is cuz I never cared

4264
03:56:07,039 --> 03:56:13,183
That's why they will always go find another Sandy Hook cuz I don't care what the names are of the people who are going to

4265
03:56:13,439 --> 03:56:19,583
Bankrupt their f****** business didn't even bother to know because most of the time they won't spend a bankruptcy business

4266
03:56:19,839 --> 03:56:25,471
That's what I'm saying that's why I have to be a bankruptcy I see I see where you're coming

4267
03:56:25,727 --> 03:56:31,871
Couple more clips left and one of the things that was really mysterious and the Alex

4268
03:56:32,127 --> 03:56:34,175
Deposition is the questions about

4269
03:56:34,687 --> 03:56:40,831
The giant background check of Leonard hofstadter

4270
03:56:41,087 --> 03:56:42,879
The document

4271
03:56:43,647 --> 03:56:44,927
The single document

4272
03:56:45,439 --> 03:56:46,719
That was recently produced to me

4273
03:56:46,975 --> 03:56:48,255
You've never seen

4274
03:56:49,279 --> 03:56:50,815
And this is a single.

4275
03:56:52,095 --> 03:56:54,911
You see where it says FSX TX

4276
03:56:55,167 --> 03:56:55,935
Dash 8

4277
03:56:56,191 --> 03:56:56,959
08

4278
03:56:57,215 --> 03:56:58,751
5544

4279
03:57:02,079 --> 03:57:05,663
You don't know what this is do what is this you couldn't tell me

4280
03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:09,247
Background information

4281
03:57:09,503 --> 03:57:13,599
I mean I can figure that out right like we can look at the top at the table of contents right here

4282
03:57:13,855 --> 03:57:17,695
And it says for license investigator purposes only do you see where it says that

4283
03:57:18,207 --> 03:57:21,535
And then you see where it says Lynyrd Posner comprehensive report

4284
03:57:22,559 --> 03:57:25,887
You see what has all these entries about all this information about Linda Posner

4285
03:57:26,399 --> 03:57:27,423
This is a w

4286
03:57:27,679 --> 03:57:28,447
Of knowledge

4287
03:57:28,959 --> 03:57:30,495
That the company has in its possession

4288
03:57:31,007 --> 03:57:32,031
Concerning menopause

4289
03:57:32,287 --> 03:57:33,055
You'd agree with that

4290
03:57:33,823 --> 03:57:34,335
Okay

4291
03:57:34,591 --> 03:57:40,735
In some of the information that the company has about menopause and its knowledge include is possible relatives right you see that

4292
03:57:40,991 --> 03:57:41,759
The bottom of the list

4293
03:57:44,063 --> 03:57:47,903
Impossible likely Associates impossible Associates right

4294
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:53,279
Okay if we go to DC versus page 66 for possible relatives

4295
03:57:54,303 --> 03:57:56,607
Can you play put the page 66 in that document for me

4296
03:58:06,335 --> 03:58:08,383
There's a bunch of people's personal information in there

4297
03:58:10,687 --> 03:58:12,991
Yes you can tell me why the company has this can you

4298
03:58:15,807 --> 03:58:16,319
I don't know

4299
03:58:16,575 --> 03:58:18,623
No one has any idea

4300
03:58:20,671 --> 03:58:24,511
Listen to these and I just wonder like

4301
03:58:25,023 --> 03:58:31,167
Who could answer that question we believe them when they say they have no idea why they have it

4302
03:58:31,423 --> 03:58:33,215
I would suspect that

4303
03:58:33,471 --> 03:58:37,567
I mean I don't have any reason to believe that they are lying about that

4304
03:58:38,335 --> 03:58:44,223
It's who knows who does not take who knows I mean who knows I will tell you who knows

4305
03:58:44,479 --> 03:58:44,991
Rob

4306
03:58:47,039 --> 03:58:47,807
You know who it is

4307
03:58:48,319 --> 03:58:49,599
David

4308
03:58:49,855 --> 03:58:55,999
Joan let's get him in

4309
03:59:02,655 --> 03:59:08,799
Is that is no longer HR it might not be that crazy that he was HR to begin with because he

4310
03:59:09,055 --> 03:59:15,199
He did some human resources for the dental company that he was apart of

4311
03:59:15,455 --> 03:59:17,759
Actually somebody

4312
03:59:18,015 --> 03:59:19,295
Either way

4313
03:59:19,551 --> 03:59:25,695
So this last clip is not where the actual deposition ends but I would say it's where it's kind of spiritually and

4314
03:59:25,951 --> 03:59:29,279
And that is an exchange

4315
03:59:29,535 --> 03:59:30,559
Where

4316
03:59:31,071 --> 03:59:37,215
So I had a little bit of a context I guess this in the Connecticut cases

4317
03:59:37,471 --> 03:59:41,055
Got us clanka who's basically the partner of Wolfgang halbig

4318
03:59:41,311 --> 03:59:44,383
An associate and some of the nonsense he was into

4319
03:59:44,639 --> 03:59:48,991
And so part of the request for production of documents

4320
03:59:49,247 --> 03:59:52,831
In these cases in Texas involved anything involving Corey Sanka

4321
03:59:53,087 --> 03:59:56,671
That's hard that is hard to find

4322
03:59:56,927 --> 03:59:57,439
So

4323
03:59:57,695 --> 03:59:59,999
They obviously would know

4324
04:00:00,511 --> 04:00:04,095
That there are documented off maybe these a co-defendant in the case

4325
04:00:04,351 --> 04:00:08,959
In Connecticut they would know that yes these orders would know

4326
04:00:09,215 --> 04:00:15,359
But there is something that would be responded in that request for documents

4327
04:00:15,615 --> 04:00:18,687
But of course nothing came up and nothing was delivered

4328
04:00:18,943 --> 04:00:20,735
Answer this is this is where I think

4329
04:00:20,991 --> 04:00:25,343
You can tell through out this but there is a sense of growing frustration with

4330
04:00:25,855 --> 04:00:29,695
Dealing with this deposition

4331
04:00:30,207 --> 04:00:30,719
This is

4332
04:00:32,767 --> 04:00:34,303
What are we even doing

4333
04:00:34,815 --> 04:00:36,095
You know Corey spank is right

4334
04:00:38,911 --> 04:00:42,239
Courselink has an associate of Wolfgang halbig was a co-defendant

4335
04:00:43,775 --> 04:00:45,567
Does that refresh your memory on Nucor stock is now

4336
04:00:48,127 --> 04:00:50,943
You would admit being a co-defendant with Corey Funk on the laughing

4337
04:00:51,199 --> 04:00:52,479
The company possesses documents

4338
04:00:53,503 --> 04:00:54,015
Correct

4339
04:00:54,527 --> 04:00:55,295
Protection form

4340
04:00:56,831 --> 04:00:58,111
Nothing to do with the Texas cases

4341
04:00:58,879 --> 04:01:05,023
Discovery request

4342
04:01:05,279 --> 04:01:06,815
Which you would know if you ever answer

4343
04:01:07,071 --> 04:01:07,583
Okay

4344
04:01:08,095 --> 04:01:14,239
I'm bread Marcus is the most disrespectful and deposition I've ever been and I don't we been into deposition for you presented the same

4345
04:01:18,591 --> 04:01:19,615
And now for you to come in

4346
04:01:21,151 --> 04:01:26,271
The topics about

4347
04:01:26,527 --> 04:01:27,551
Reason responsible case

4348
04:01:27,807 --> 04:01:30,879
I need to get up to speed

4349
04:01:31,135 --> 04:01:31,903
First of all

4350
04:01:32,159 --> 04:01:35,999
I'm objecting on the faces of you asking about the Connecticut litigation

4351
04:01:36,255 --> 04:01:40,095
I'm not asking I'm not saying you have any not ejecting to ask any questions about

4352
04:01:40,351 --> 04:01:41,375
Your Discovery request

4353
04:01:42,399 --> 04:01:42,911
Second of all

4354
04:01:43,423 --> 04:01:49,567
No one is trying to be disrespectful here she's doing her best job and I don't care whether you think she is in there not

4355
04:01:49,823 --> 04:01:55,967
Don't know care what your personal opinions are on or not if you have a problem with it with I'm sure you you obviously Duke you're going to

4356
04:01:56,223 --> 04:01:57,759
Try to do something about it

4357
04:01:58,015 --> 04:02:00,831
And and I and I want you to maintain for the record

4358
04:02:01,343 --> 04:02:07,487
Everyone here has been working as hard as they can to actually get you answers that you want and I'm sorry that at the house

4359
04:02:07,743 --> 04:02:09,279
100000 pages of documents

4360
04:02:09,535 --> 04:02:12,351
That you're asked about specific ones that she doesn't have the exact answer

4361
04:02:14,399 --> 04:02:20,543
Okay man you know what I'm not I don't answer Discovery bread I would like you to show me the

4362
04:02:20,799 --> 04:02:21,567
Responded to

4363
04:02:22,591 --> 04:02:28,735
Which ones you saying have not been responded to

4364
04:02:28,991 --> 04:02:34,367
Have you ever been compelled by a court order to actually respond to those documents cuz I got the faulted

4365
04:02:34,623 --> 04:02:35,903
But I haven't actually seen the most

4366
04:02:36,159 --> 04:02:39,487
I understand that

4367
04:02:39,743 --> 04:02:40,511
But I'm

4368
04:02:40,767 --> 04:02:42,047
I'm I'm unclear

4369
04:02:42,303 --> 04:02:48,447
Awning from defaulted on it and I'm unclear the obligation to taxes supplement it but if you if you want to ask

4370
04:02:48,703 --> 04:02:51,775
Ask me to do that that I'll do that for you I don't know I'm asking her

4371
04:02:52,031 --> 04:02:52,799
Directly

4372
04:02:53,311 --> 04:02:55,615
But they haven't produced me documents to my Discovery weekly

4373
04:02:56,127 --> 04:02:57,919
And I want them to admit they refused

4374
04:02:58,175 --> 04:03:04,063
And you kept interrupting me about I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you I apologize that's not why I sent and I will

4375
04:03:04,319 --> 04:03:06,879
Go ahead and answer the question today since you can please

4376
04:03:07,647 --> 04:03:13,791
Wow it was not hard to make that teenage boy fall down

4377
04:03:14,047 --> 04:03:20,191
That was really a bit

4378
04:03:20,447 --> 04:03:26,591
Obviously the boiling over frustration of like dealing with his nonsense

4379
04:03:26,847 --> 04:03:30,687
The responsive Brad being like

4380
04:03:30,943 --> 04:03:37,087
Yeah everyone's doing the best I can I'm sorry I'm sorry

4381
04:03:37,343 --> 04:03:43,487
Such a perfect button to end on kind of of these of these

4382
04:03:43,743 --> 04:03:46,815
Is not doing the best Brad Brad Brad

4383
04:03:47,327 --> 04:03:47,839
Brad

4384
04:03:48,095 --> 04:03:52,447
Is there a lawyer you can't but you can't be a f****** lawyer

4385
04:03:52,703 --> 04:03:58,847
For a god day of corporate representatives and come at me with what my mom would say if I got a C

4386
04:03:59,103 --> 04:04:00,383
My dad was pissed

4387
04:04:00,895 --> 04:04:03,711
He's doing his best shut the fuk up

4388
04:04:03,967 --> 04:04:04,991
Unreal

4389
04:04:06,015 --> 04:04:12,159
I think we were almost probably including

4390
04:04:12,415 --> 04:04:15,487
Probably about that unsurprising

4391
04:04:15,743 --> 04:04:21,887
So I think one of the one of the unfortunate things about this is that obviously

4392
04:04:22,143 --> 04:04:28,287
There is three hours long at the Dari once like 5 hours long

4393
04:04:28,543 --> 04:04:34,687
Things that we just copies we couldn't cover everything I write a little other tidbits that

4394
04:04:34,943 --> 04:04:37,759
That are obviously for someone like me

4395
04:04:38,015 --> 04:04:38,783
It's like

4396
04:04:39,039 --> 04:04:40,319
Everything is is catnip

4397
04:04:40,575 --> 04:04:46,719
Yeah there's a ton of stuff that I would for 12 hours and talk to you about if

4398
04:04:46,975 --> 04:04:53,119
Felt like it was acceptable

4399
04:04:53,375 --> 04:04:59,519
I think your patients would wear thin about 4 hours and 2 minutes

4400
04:04:59,775 --> 04:05:05,919
That's about where

4401
04:05:06,175 --> 04:05:12,319
I find I found these really Illuminating them anyways I think

4402
04:05:12,575 --> 04:05:14,367
I think that obviously

4403
04:05:14,879 --> 04:05:15,391
The

4404
04:05:16,159 --> 04:05:18,975
Battaglia wine as a corporate representative is

4405
04:05:19,231 --> 04:05:25,375
It's not as funny as do maybe I've been at

4406
04:05:28,959 --> 04:05:35,103
Yeah I mean he he he was much more scared and he also had kind of an almost

4407
04:05:35,359 --> 04:05:38,431
Laissez-faire attitude about it to of like

4408
04:05:39,199 --> 04:05:45,343
Hey if I know something I'll tell you but if I don't know something I'm just going to say I don't know man I guess fear and confusion made it

4409
04:05:45,599 --> 04:05:51,231
Funny where is Dario's like a preparation is clearly demonstrated in the deposition

4410
04:05:51,487 --> 04:05:57,631
It didn't have the same humor and the things that were interesting about it we're upsetting

4411
04:05:57,887 --> 04:06:02,239
Deeply deeply upset that's

4412
04:06:02,751 --> 04:06:03,519
Wow

4413
04:06:04,031 --> 04:06:08,639
You know that okay it's like that psychopath

4414
04:06:08,895 --> 04:06:12,223
Test thing you know better I'm sorry to bring up John twice

4415
04:06:12,479 --> 04:06:13,759
But

4416
04:06:14,271 --> 04:06:20,415
It is like that story of you know like all of this this psychopath goes to a funeral meet somebody cool and they like how do you

4417
04:06:20,671 --> 04:06:24,767
You meet him again in the psychopathic saw you kill somebody that you only meet them at funerals

4418
04:06:25,279 --> 04:06:28,095
That is exactly what I felt whenever

4419
04:06:28,351 --> 04:06:32,959
Daria heard the email about Wolfgang f****** stocking people and she was like

4420
04:06:33,215 --> 04:06:36,543
Personal somebody cares about you and your like whether you are

4421
04:06:36,799 --> 04:06:40,895
Terrified committed were terrified

4422
04:06:41,151 --> 04:06:47,295
Yeah it it's a disaster incredibly bizarre I think that

4423
04:06:47,551 --> 04:06:52,927
Certainly something that I wasn't as aware of before is the content of some of those emails

4424
04:06:53,183 --> 04:06:56,511
All that are just deeply upsetting f***** up and

4425
04:06:56,767 --> 04:07:00,863
That the relationship between the times that like

4426
04:07:01,119 --> 04:07:04,703
When these emails are getting sad when the Rasmus being done when

4427
04:07:04,959 --> 04:07:05,727
There's

4428
04:07:05,983 --> 04:07:12,127
Pretty strong indications of negligence and just ignoring what they're doing

4429
04:07:12,383 --> 04:07:14,431
Doing and who they're promoting

4430
04:07:14,687 --> 04:07:18,783
It just it just looks really bad now it does not look good God's not

4431
04:07:19,039 --> 04:07:25,183
So glad to be on the other side of this I'm glad that I we can you know it's out in the open

4432
04:07:25,439 --> 04:07:30,815
Little bit of a weight off my shoulders

4433
04:07:31,071 --> 04:07:33,631
Dino not tipping the hand at all

4434
04:07:33,887 --> 04:07:40,031
It was almost 2 months now so

4435
04:07:40,287 --> 04:07:46,431
For not tipping the hand but more proud of you for doing it and all that stuff I'm not going to accomplish

4436
04:07:53,087 --> 04:07:59,231
So I guess that brings us to the end of this but I think we may have another

4437
04:07:59,487 --> 04:08:05,631
So that sort of deposition Asian

4438
04:08:05,887 --> 04:08:12,031
We look forward to that but until then

4439
04:08:12,287 --> 04:08:18,431
We aren't fighting I go to bed Jordan

4440
04:08:18,687 --> 04:08:24,063
The sex robot
