1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B B I'm sick of them posing as if

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Lean and talk a little bit about

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordans

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Uforia what's up

9
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot today honest

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,592
Leslie is a little bit of getting back

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
To it yeah like

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,248
Getting back from we went on a vacation to get back to Selene getting back to

13
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
Work getting back into a little bit of

14
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,416
I think I think one of the things we took one of the undervalued or under respect

15
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,256
Thought about elements of vacations are how much it makes you like

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
I don't know my day-to-day life is better than nothing

17
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
I think it is reading Terry Pratchett while we were on vacation and he had a really great quote that

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
I was like

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
You've never really been anywhere until you get

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,944
You know until we got back I was like that's kind of

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
The silly thing to say and I kind of get it

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
I've been on vacation it's been a long time

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
Experience over and over again

24
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
Everytime you go on a vacation to your life is probably in a different circumstantial or was the last time we're sure it was nice

25
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
22 come back

26
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
And

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032
Take a break

28
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
Now I really want to get back to work I think there's some things but we're dangling

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
Threads

30
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,832
Do not run into any lizards

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
Having perception in my head that there were lizards everywhere when I was okay to maybe it's because I was a couple feet shorter and closer to the

32
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Grandma I can just see them everywhere

33
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
I did not catch any Wizards

34
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,240
Got blisters on my feet the first day we were there so I didn't clean up any Kohl's

35
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,408
My childhood home has been torn down and turned into an apartment complex

36
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
It like that

37
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
At least it wasn't a convenience store

38
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Lovely time

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
I'm sure you know I have a hard time finding anything similarly

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
To you you know it

41
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
I feel like the vacation was great

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
But my bright spot was

43
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
When we got back

44
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
My dogs were still staying with my partners mother

45
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
Hey and they got back today

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Send it.

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,224
First time I saw they went so ridiculously called

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
How did I ever leave these beautiful things

49
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,392
Pittsburgh PA

50
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
That's love bajor gone for a week

51
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
This is what it's all about me

52
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Yeah

53
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,936
It's fairly similar with a lot more yelling

54
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,080
He's yelling at me quite a bit

55
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
I got some snuggles and some aggressive headbutt

56
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Eventually

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
But as I was coming up the stairs with the luck

58
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Has to teach you a lesson before they can be as hell but it wouldn't have it any other way

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,607
River difficulty ahead of us and that is kind of like we missed a bit of time

60
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
And so also

61
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Some stuff happened

62
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Right when we got back

63
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
And it's very relevant to our our our business

64
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,407
I didn't really know exactly what the strategy was going to be in terms of

65
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,783
You know do we go back and listen to all of last week's

66
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
It's a little challenging at

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Spoiler alert to email

68
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
Yeah I mean

69
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Buckwild on this

70
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Since the time we've been back

71
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
I haven't had enough time to read all of

72
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
It's like 3,000 pages

73
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Jesus

74
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
It's okay it's their boring emails

75
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,551
Doing this I'm not reading business evals you know I thought that to myself a whole bunch of time

76
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Because

77
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Most of what I read so far is

78
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Talk to you forwarding something to another person

79
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,375
Nonsensical email to him and him not responded

80
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Stop the time I'm looking around like

81
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
I've been next email is going to be like we're going to need to refill the toilet paper in the lobby

82
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,455
How do I clear my cache

83
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
So I haven't I haven't gotten the full enough

84
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:47,135
View in and just like everybody else I think it would be almost impossible I don't I don't know

85
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,463
Unless you had a team reading them making chunks or whatever

86
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
To get through all three thousand pages in

87
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
In the time it would take the

88
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,215
Multiple Outlets working on that priority but at the same time

89
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,639
To be able to do some like really current stuff for Monday

90
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
Through a narrow with a dartboard

91
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
Started the arrow board whatever

92
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
And May 27th

93
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
Thursday of last week came up Thursday and Friday

94
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,535
Thursday ended up to silly and Friday's off the tables

95
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
Yeah here we go we're going to do May 27th 2021 budget

96
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
This is going to do is going to be at

97
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Alex is very sick

98
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,223
Let's not overburden ourselves with like

99
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Something that's going to be

100
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
All day

101
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
Nobody wants to come back to the office the first day and really deal with that stack of paper that built-up you know

102
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Pupae has to be taken care of

103
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Sure but not today

104
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,775
So let's take a moment to say hello to one walk and then introduced

105
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
A new develop

106
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
So I think it's much better but his National discourse thanks to Alex

107
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,551
Most of Germany

108
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831

00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
Yes sir I have decided that look Lee's birthday things

So

112
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
I have

113
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
A new drop

114
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Okay alright

115
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351

117
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Someone wife is giving someone death

118
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
You can say that

119
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:51,039
Time to get some Happy Birthday shout-outs to poke Sarah

00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,511

Send me your bagels not very sure I think that I have been told how to pronounce it and I refused

00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999

00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
I-88 like 8

129
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Death

Dueto America is it's our god-given right to ignore British

131
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543
Pronunciation

132
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,383

Almost over for happy birthday Frank the close of the happy birthday shout out

139
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
Giving someone life is giving someone death

140
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
You can say that

141
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Life is death

142
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Felix

143
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
That's going to go down in the rake affect Hall of Fame

144
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
Two episodes from now we're both going to be like Addison

00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
Adorable 85 episodes from now on

146
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
Continue losing my s*** every tough we will see

147
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Alright

148
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
27

149
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
Alex's

150
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,399
Some strange mood to give you a little bit of a

151
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Oh my god did I get hired now cuz that was fake

152
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
That is fake

153
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,879
I do kind of feel personally offended by that last that was Pillsbury Alex

154
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,071
So this is where I actually got on the hook

155
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,167
Sometimes it takes me a little while when I start up an episode 42 be like

156
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
I'm blessed that you are

157
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
I got on the hook immediately

158
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
All eyes I have been brainstorming lot of it

159
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Thank me to do this

160
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
For a lot of it you're not going over

161
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
I really just think it's important I cut

162
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Right to the chase

163
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Watch out yours coming up

164
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Today

165
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Get to it all

166
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,335
Soap for my ears I hear this is Alex saying let's go through the b*******

167
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Outlook

168
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,247
Shoot Straight

169
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Finally time

170
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
Some of this stuff I've said before some of it I have not but it will all be

171
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
My hands to God's ears

172
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Call will be revealed in the fullness

173
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
Yeah you're saying that like he's been on air

174
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
420 years ago

175
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
That's not actually true

176
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,495
Sounds like it might live before I just got hit

177
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Weather

178
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
Extreme Clarity of what I was doing

179
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Knowledge information we have interest

180
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Vision but the brilliance

181
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Computer program

182
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
That's been working on a problem working on the problem

183
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
And then suddenly it's completed the problem

184
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
With the computer

185
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
But completion of the buildings

186
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
I mean answer come sliding out

187
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
It was just a whole nother level

188
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Exactly what they're going to do

189
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
How they're going to do it

190
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Hauser operating

191
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Okay so again Alex has had a Moment of clarity

192
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,807
Every single day this is the first time in a long time that we have taken some time off

193
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Alex has it

194
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Part of me is like

195
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,975
I wonder what he would fix this like I got free rein now I don't have to worry about you

196
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Parents aren't home

197
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,655
Jordan are listening to speak freely

198
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
Countries of Asia

199
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,311
I wouldn't think that was what was on his mind

200
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
Sure

201
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
It sure was

202
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:36,735
Hit by now at 27 years he's realized it recordings

203
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Yeah it's just I can't stand this a****** every single day having a vision

204
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Oh my God

205
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
It was like finally all the pieces connected to play so you can't do this everyday like I do like that the computer

206
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,983
Thinks it's going to be over sooner at but unfortunately the computer took a little bit longer than it was expect

207
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
Hey man I mean you're joking around about that but I have

208
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
Has been in a situation where let's say I am downloading the game PlayStation Network

209
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
And then what

210
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
Check back in 40 minutes

211
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
Computer think all of these computers

212
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Tell you

213
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
What they're thinking and it turns out what they're thinking is

214
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
It's it's terrible you know.

215
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Do robots dream of

216
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Being late

217
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
For work that's what I was

218
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Yep yep

219
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
Do robots dream of

220
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
Excuses for tardiness

221
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Here's the deal

222
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,687
I think this is what Alex's Vision or his new bit of

223
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
The clarity is about

224
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
To do with the globalist

225
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
And their new plan

226
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,087
My town for this cuz it's on

227
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
It's absurd

228
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
What I wrote

229
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Right after I

230
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Is

231
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
On screen

232
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Send it transmission

233
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
The scientific

234
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Dictatorship control

235
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Toolbox the great lie

236
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
The greatest of Lies

237
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
That is too obscure

238
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
The great truth

239
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
That is

240
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
And that is our human psyche

241
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Piercing the Veil

242
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
And

243
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Connecting in an even stronger way with God

244
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
And basic

245
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Telekinesis

246
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Application trying to suppress

247
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Okay

248
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Alright

249
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:47,039
Figured something

250
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,903
Write in order to distract from the fact that we've connected with God and now we should move objects with her mind

251
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
That's correct

252
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Here's my problem

253
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
Here's my problem alright we live in the future

254
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
So I know that this is fight

255
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Him saying that the real goal

256
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
Is mass telekinesis

257
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
The next day you can be like fauci release

258
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
Females

259
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Hirelevel

260
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
If you've got mascot telekinesis on the way

261
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
I want to be clear about something to because I'm not an idiot I know that he means telepathy

262
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,927
Of course humans like a connection

263
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Speak without

264
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,583
Speaking so right right

265
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
He means but he could have

266
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
That's like I can pick like Isaac Asimov like all the sudden our brains just grow a little bit bigger in the right spot

267
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,111
Course we can move chat with our minds and I know that it is but it's

268
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
Already have mass telekinesis everybody knows it

269
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,791
And

270
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
It's not just telling

271
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
Kinesis with each other

272
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
Obviously obviously this is getting a lot stronger

273
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
Course reason

274
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Genetic

275
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Development

276
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Fox's the environment what whatever it is

277
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
The globalist know this they want to control it

278
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
I want to keep

279
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
The public from understanding

280
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Alright

281
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Can't get over him saying telekinesis at 7

282
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
Obviously women have it stronger that's just so good

283
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,775
If you take him just literally at his word.

284
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
You're not giving the generosity understanding like amines telepathy

285
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Like it's telekinesis but not

286
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
Just with each other like we can only lift each other

287
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Of course

288
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
Bug

289
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
So I think what Alex is going to get

290
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
2 I think

291
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,975
The point he's trying to make is that humans have this telepathic

292
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
The connection because of

293
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Connection with God and

294
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
The globalists don't like that

295
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,143
They want to control it in order to control it they're going to come up with a big lie

296
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
And I think the big lie that he's going to say

297
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
Is alien

298
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
Therapy to be review

299
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Because he says this

300
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Send

301
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
I mean this is just childhood's end

302
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
This is really good

303
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Just the book

304
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,599
The difference lies that they're going to launch is going to be

305
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Alien Transmissions first

306
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
Chileans are going to be communicating

307
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
Alien

308
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
We already had contact and they gave us technology

309
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
That's really where all this came from

310
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,983
All the upheaval in the popol endorse it and say that's our God

311
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
This is our group that is what they want us to do

312
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,479
You just got to accept and do the entities one

313
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
That's just the plot of childhood's end

314
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
We come down say that we can't reveal ourselves for 50 years until you're used to us being

315
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Look like

316
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Harkins option of the email

317
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,519
No the only person who can break through the illusion is obviously Rowdy Roddy Piper

318
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,127
You know naturally that's the way it's got to go Our Generations Rowdy Roddy Piper

319
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
So the aliens are going to come down

320
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
They're going to give the pope all these

321
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Messages

322
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,415
I'm not going to reveal themselves because they didn't in the book

323
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
Still in jail in this scenario

324
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
Flummoxed

325
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
To be fair I don't know if Alex is talking

326
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,263
Deceive

327
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
That's not a problem for him at

328
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
Also the plan is then once

329
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,687
The pope is doing all this stuff and telling people to have to listen to the aliens

330
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
In order to get this technology

331
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Or something

332
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Then

333
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Leader

334
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
Who is able to talk to them and if you do what he says

335
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Everything's going to be okay

336
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Will learn

337
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
That this is one of the scenarios

338
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,679
Different ones at different times are all at once

339
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
Aliens coming and we got to do some certain things

340
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
To stop them

341
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
So there's this bad alien

342
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
A f******

343
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,623
Non Pleiades I'm not f****** around with just a lien anymore

344
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,743
Kind of animal do they look like

345
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
What are we talkin about need some specificity in order for this to be any fun

346
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,751
Do this better

347
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
I thought the plan

348
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,359
Was Plan B and they're just going to give us a bio-weapon

349
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,199
In order to kill everyone off why do they need to do that

350
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,735
Theater dad about patch

351
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,295
Give people to show its bread and

352
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Circus man

353
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
Everything you blow about

354
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
The globalists have a plan that was direct

355
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,535
Do them by the devil that involve the super bioweapon release little kill off the population

356
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Why do they need

357
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,119
Bacon alien landing to get people to do things

358
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Precor living in at Galax

359
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Sick Make-a-Wish scenario we're all about to die so aliens are trying to give us a good run before

360
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
It makes as much sense as anything I was just saying

361
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
I don't know it doesn't does not make sense

362
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
So I guess

363
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
That's the

364
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Big Revelation that Alex Adkins

365
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
Restarts the first

366
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Yep

367
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
I need some other really big news that he under sales

368
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
This is huge.

369
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Frankenstein mad scientist chopping different pieces of human running

370
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
How high powered electricity through it

371
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Reanimating a corpse

372
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,407
Well now they're actually able to do things very very similar to that in the real world so many times

373
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
What humans envisioned

374
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,247
Hundreds even thousands of years ago

375
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
We are now able to Bill

376
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
On a mass scale

377
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Comes with all of that

378
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
Sure yeah death

379
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
Well only a little bit see what has to happen if you have to play music and then the body will be kind

380
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,752
Ambulatory in a kennel little Dancy way

381
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,312
Towards the source of that music

382
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
Sure there's a Weekend at Bernie's 2 scenario okay pass that it's a Weekend at Bernie's

383
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:44,576
This is really kind of like the evolution of human technology

384
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
Well I mean

385
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
Dread alexina

386
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Maybe

387
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:56,608
Seems a little bit like it yesu Frankenstein is real

388
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Cool

389
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,240
I don't know where the bottom is in Turkey

390
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,080
Like they're just think what I can say is a joke that she thing

391
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Actually he actually is suggesting the universal monster

392
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
Kind of

393
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,368
Area you know he's already got Dracula's right

394
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
He's just trying to

395
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,464
To create the monster

396
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,168
He's just trying to convince people that that graveyard smash is real

397
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
It's the Monster Mash

398
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,496
Gunby

399
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
Everyone dies

400
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
That's the month

401
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
Monster swim

402
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,408
Was the second one

403
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,736
Ticketmaster Tuesday is called the monster stock market

404
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
Crash stock by God damn it I blew I blew it

405
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,136
There is a certain to get a follow-up cuz monster swim

406
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
That's true and then

407
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
Years later he had the

408
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:00,864
Climate match

409
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
None of them worked out except for the Monster Mash Cisco had done just like various colors

410
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,664
The Thong Song like black songs about dog that just released one next month or something about a negligee

411
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Beautiful

412
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
I could see him doing that but I watched that making of the song video on YouTube there's a there's a

413
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
The documentary series

414
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,584
About these these

415
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Squeeze hits

416
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,448
I like how they came to be and I saw the part about Cisco's the thugs

417
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Erudite

418
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:43,872
I could see him making the series of songs about different undergarments everything else

419
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
Does it work to give it a go

420
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
Silences little bit

421
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Stem cells

422
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
Paint by numbers

423
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
Art stores like five bucks and it's got a little

424
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
I just been here on a 27 years researching

425
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,104
What you got to White River levels

426
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Stem cell

427
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Spell means a

428
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
150-lb humanoid

429
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
Human

430
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
Chimpanzee clone that doesn't sound true

431
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:31,744
But I could be wrong I just don't think so

432
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,352
Nope he doesn't paint-by-the-numbers and get the green unicorn

433
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Pretty numbers are wrong picture

434
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Look like

435
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Brown

436
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah but numbers is ostensibly creative

437
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Because there

438
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,160
Do you want the extra there's numbers

439
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Didn't know in the abstract it exists

440
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Without you

441
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,096
You can just imagine that those colors are already there you're supposed to

442
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,680
Adult you can usually tell what the picture is even without color

443
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
Open there before

444
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Sunnyway chimpanzee humans

445
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
150 lb in a kg

446
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
And this is important

447
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
Because there was just that bill

448
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,760
The way through Congress

449
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,344
Rules on stem cells

450
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
And some cells are defined as

451
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Tissue

452
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
About stem cell

453
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,888
We're talking about is growing human or humanoid

454
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
The definition

455
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Better

456
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Video this

457
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Here's the article

458
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
48 + 49

459
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
Defeat Braun

460
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Bubble Indiana

461
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,552
Certain types of human animal

462
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
Sixty votes were needed

463
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
But it didn't pass

464
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,232
So did you hear that is legal right now

465
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,072
Human-animal hybrids

466
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Against human

467
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,216
There's two things that are going on that I was just kind of playing with

468
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Conflating

469
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
There's one is the bill that got defeated in the Senate

470
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:29,248
That was an attempt by the GOP to criminalize genetic research that involved creating embryos that work of Merit

471
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,576
And from what I understand good thing that did not pass

472
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
It seems like

473
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,696
It was a little bit of a trojan horse

474
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
Something about a boar

475
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
I know it always goes back to that

476
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,424
He's complaining this with is a recent movie that was made by the international Society

477
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
84cm cell research

478
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
They loosened their rules about how long a human embryo can

479
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Can be used in

480
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Experiments

481
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
Previously that a standard policy that studies the Wimpy on 40

482
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,200
Some days would absolutely not

483
00:26:59,456 --> 00:26:59,968
Be done

484
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Isn't technology they say that these experiments

485
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Could possibly done

486
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
The quotes that moves quote

487
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Only if

488
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Lots of conditions are met

489
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:15,840
We're not going to suddenly have horse people drawing our cars around that's we're going to be fine

490
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
The house is freaking out about these

491
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Chimeras

492
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
And what have you

493
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
And that leads him to go to break

494
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Extreme

495
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Pretty extreme

496
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
They're figuring out how locked out of

497
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
So they can kill everybody

498
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Everybody stay in your houses

499
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Well that happened

500
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
What combat robots go up and down the streets and so

501
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
This isn't

502
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
Something that they are

503
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,232
Just thinking about doing this is all set up very very soon

504
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
You and your family will be killed

505
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
2 years 50

506
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
But if we don't hold him back everyone listening is dead

507
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,216
Okay

508
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,032
They're going to kill you they're going to kill me

509
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,848
Kill Everybody

510
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
The bad

511
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,992
But you a certain extent you know

512
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,624
We live in kind of a fairly mundane world

513
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
27

514
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
When we go from that to like

515
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:18,816
Oh there's robots in the streets and chimeras in my home I think that would be at least a little bit more

516
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:24,704
Exciting four days ago I was having a fun hot dog and on San Souci Beach

517
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,568
I come back and I got to hear Alex saying that I was dead

518
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Dead

519
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
It's a jarring

520
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:42,112
I do see your neck Juliet a 45-degree angle right now so that

521
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
That might be trouble yeah it's it's

522
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Some

523
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,816
You know what this there's that that standard think about like we know if you just keep moving

524
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
It's not hard

525
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,680
To keep moving. Then you start moving again

526
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,776
Object at rest

527
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
Obviously

528
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Bullshittin everything

529
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Troy

530
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:10,784
It's a little bit after a week was not listening to him to come back in here like

531
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,440
You and your family everybody listen to the show will be dead within five years if we don't stop my enemy.

532
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
It's comically over

533
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
What I take time off

534
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:27,424
I start to doubt myself these like

535
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,264
Alex isn't as crazy as I think

536
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,664
Cannot be real not like you says within two to five years everyone listening will be dead

537
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,272
No it makes you realize how many like

538
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,552
I totally get

539
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
When you're when you've been doing this non-stop for a long

540
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,696
You know you forget how real people react

541
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
To do this kind of stuff

542
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,608
You're the one who's a conspiracy theorist there's no way that anyone would get away with that

543
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
I'm Atkins

544
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,984
Spirit appears this can't be real

545
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
This can't be real

546
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
So

547
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Hurry hurry

548
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Discuss this neck

549
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Let's see

550
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
The globalists

551
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Sprite

552
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
They plan

553
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Heard it

554
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
At least two

555
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Super bioweapon kill off

556
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Maybe that's

557
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
Plan A and B plan C involves aliens coming down and not revealing themselves

558
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:31,168
Telling us that there is bad aliens are coming we got to do something in order to stop about aliens

559
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
It'll be counterproductive

560
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
Give.

561
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:37,824
Yeah I heard that there's a plan d

562
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
What humans can envision

563
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
We can end up building

564
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
What we've gotten to this point

565
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Is

566
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
Free energy

567
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Active life extension

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:57,024
Supercomputers way more powerful than what you're currently even aware

569
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Exist

570
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,632
And the decisions have been made

571
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,192
To basically go ahead and go operational

572
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,752
When a system that will make us obsolete

573
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Obsolete in their works

574
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,616
Computer won't recognize Beauty

575
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
Is computers won't have our ancient history

576
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,248
These computers didn't create the computers like we did

577
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
Okay

578
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Force pushing this and in my life

579
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,256
The whole show up and I just made this very

580
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
Very simple

581
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
And that's

582
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
Alex's talking about robot

583
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,712
When I hear somebody

584
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
The politics but Alex has

585
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Worrying about

586
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
We are going to be replaced

587
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Kind of

588
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
You know it exists in a certain linguist

589
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,256
Space

590
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Yeah you know

591
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:07,168
The way he's talking is like a person in like the early eighties who is like

592
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Computers at the Devil

593
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:14,592
You know the computers are going to have a safe trip

594
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,920
But we don't live there he uses computers all the time

595
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
He lives in a world where

596
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
Computers are perfectly fine and people are evil

597
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
You know

598
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:27,904
Keep the people he wants to tell you are evil letters are ethically neutral

599
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
Yeah

600
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,536
I don't know I just get I just get a little worried

601
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,120
Fears of replacement are generally not

602
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
They're not good opening

603
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
Well you know what it what comes after that is usually bad

604
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
It's a little bit like a little bit like the space races and we deal with where it's like they're evil cat being

605
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
But you like it that's code for something else

606
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
The great replacement Theory you can't just be like

607
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
No no no it's

608
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,600
Computers that were worried about I'd not have a be like

609
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
Is this juice again I feel like this is using

610
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
I know that doesn't really care that much about workers right so it couldn't really be a conversation about like automation

611
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:07,840
Tune in the workplace

612
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
We need more gross

613
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,472
I don't know it's just

614
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
It's a word that I don't like hearing

615
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,592
Zoey 101 more thing here about the global

616
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Okay

617
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
If you don't resist this

618
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,992
Under survival of the fittest

619
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
And social Darwinism

620
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
You

621
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
Deserve

622
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
So it's all about humans being a commodity

623
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
Mass smuggling of children

624
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
For sex abuse

625
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
For slave labor

626
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
But really

627
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
It's about

628
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
Committing crimes in God's eyes

629
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Having you do nothing

630
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,872
Spiritual hedge

631
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
A protection can be removed for mice

632
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Everyone can be a

633
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,368
And so this is very sophisticated

634
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
Interdimensional du Lac

635
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Warfare

636
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
Hellboy

637
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Tough tough to wrestle with

638
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Isn't snow it's not be so confident I feel like I need to ask

639
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
That's part of the trick

640
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
That is true

641
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,712
Yeah so the first thought that he has there is a globalist believe you don't fight you deserve what happens to you if you are

642
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,296
That's essentially just so many crib from

643
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,320
Quiet Wars

644
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
The first chapter and Bill Cooper's book Behold a Pale Horse

645
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
Leave your meat on the

646
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Play Future

647
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,280
Meant to be

648
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:45,376
And then the second part is just that like if you don't

649
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Defend

650
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
God's law

651
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,752
Then you make us all susceptible

652
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
God's punishment

653
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
Which the only thing that could

654
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
Really lead towards

655
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
There's a fiacre

656
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
I mean

657
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah yeah absolutely entirely around it

658
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,808
Too strict religious rules

659
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
You do

660
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:10,720
It's not the ones that are the religious rules are really great when they're in power and allowed to kind of go under

661
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
Everybody knows that from history

662
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
Are you just cured nonsense

663
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Gary

664
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
Interdimensional Collective

665
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
Play that's true

666
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
That's the closest to Lake

667
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
I'll let it slide

668
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,944
It's arguably hyperbole

669
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
I mean I know you

670
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
Not speak metaphorically

671
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,928
You could hear that and be like okay whatever

672
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
Contextually weird

673
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't

674
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
If Alex believes

675
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
That doing things that are against

676
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,656
His religious rules

677
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Make everybody

678
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,800
Susceptible to God's Wrath because God removes the hedge of protection

679
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
Then the only way to keep everyone safe

680
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:06,272
Is to make sure that everyone is forcibly adhering to God's rules true according to his version of God

681
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
And to me

682
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,136
I find that to be an incredibly f*****-up way to

683
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,184
To conceive of how

684
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Society should be organized

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
I mean V ironic part about it I think is

686
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Something similar

687
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
In practice

688
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Is what we all try

689
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
To-do defeated disease

690
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,080
To certain extent do you know what I mean like we have to

691
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
We have to allow a certain amount of like

692
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,736
Oh we are locking down in order to keep but you know

693
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
Everybody if people don't act

694
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,160
In everybody's interested in the steps to SEPTA ability of that disease is spread

695
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Throughout

696
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,976
So he's fine with that

697
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
6

698
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,816
I think I did what I'm saying

699
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Think your thought is interesting in it

700
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,936
I said I do see a little bit of a parallel

701
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,592
Yeah it and I think what I think is most interesting about Alex's conception is the Divine Wrath

702
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
As opposed to the actual

703
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Causally

704
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,088
Determined

705
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Yeah I don't know

706
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,952
I don't

707
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
I don't feel like it

708
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
It's possible for Alex

709
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,792
Contain this kind of

710
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
Stinking

711
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
And this this idea set

712
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
And also actually believe in the First Amendment

713
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
That's how could you possibly believe in freedom of religion

714
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
If

715
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
You believe that

716
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
Breaking God's rules

717
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Makes

718
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
What is the hedge of protection

719
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,808
Can go away one of The Commandments is you should have no other God than me

720
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,880
But if you follow another religion or you don't follow a religion

721
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:52,000
I mean how could you follow or how could you believe in freedom of speech if the government has to

722
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:55,328
I guess murder you for taking the lord's name in vain

723
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
You know what I'm saying like

724
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,216
Penalty for sin is death obviously it would be it would be a challenge

725
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Certainly

726
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,848
To believe in a republic

727
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
I think we're seeing a little bit of

728
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Some flaws

729
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,808
And I just think this is hilarious we're not going to talk about him at all

730
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,648
I think it's really hilarious that this dude is showing up after the beginning of this

731
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
Bulshit

732
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
Alright we are butterflies ladies and gentleman and Ethan just get in the studio

733
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
But please don't forget that

734
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,776
Listeners and viewers like you

735
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,616

Do you actually your real serious reporter let's talk about

743
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:09,056
Telekinesis undercover sting operation inside of Frankenstein's Castle actually you know what's ironic

744
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:15,200
He could actually do an amazing sting operation on Alex

745
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,600
Really good if you just brought a hidden camera into a regular conversation without you

746
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,464
God dammit somebody you've said he can beat

747
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
Turned right you can return from the federal body

748
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
Jones's career I don't care

749
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,448
God I wish I would have

750
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,800
We got to get a billionaire on our side to just throw money at

751
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,128
People further irony though is that if he did Sting Alex

752
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
I don't think I would believe

753
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
I couldn't trust it cuz it still

754
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,808
Dangers of lost credibility

755
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
I don't care James O'Keefe has a

756
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
I guess another Facebook story I don't care

757
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Whatever

758
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
I don't care

759
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
Interesting story to tell

760
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
Solvang

761
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
And white papers and textbooks and

762
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,728
You're very low circulation books

763
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Easier

764
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
You like Klaus Schwab

765
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
Past

766
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Jon B holdren

767
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Real quick

768
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:25,344
Jumpy Holdren's book ecoscience wasn't a low circulation book it was a text

769
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,928
Was it a mass-market paperback

770
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Fail

771
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Barnes & Noble tried to push poles

772
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Rockefeller

773
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,800
Club around documents secret documents

774
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,664
A whole bunch of heart I've secret documents on the Bilderberg Group

775
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Out of the Senate archives

776
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,088
Hold up a motorcycle in Virginia without cover millerberg there and just said here have this

777
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
That was all

778
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
How are the 60s

779
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,512
To cover the u.s. Union

780
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
For the deed for the industrialization project

781
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
Probably cuz you got them from a random guy on a motorcycle random guy on a motorcycle handed me papers

782
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,896
Reason people don't believe me

783
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
It's basically deepthroat isn't it

784
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
You mean the park

785
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:28,832
Open garage random dude on a motorcycle drives up to

786
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,416
No big deal

787
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,304
I think this is probably just like John Birch Society esca literature and ideas

788
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Cuz it's talking about

789
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,424
Just like infiltrating the Union's obviously

790
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
Do the best workers

791
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,312
Kind of ideas of unionization or something that are antithetical to the Patriot movie

792
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,711
So you might as well say that there's no point in you needed in cuddalore

793
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Not only infiltrative

794
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,575
The plot in order to destroy America

795
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:05,183
So I just love the idea of Alex in there's a guy on a motorcycle comes up

796
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,583
I got all the archives of the secret

797
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
Virginia cuz I remember when

798
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,263
What's the weather

799
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
A lot of videos that is in

800
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
One of his documentaries I think

801
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,431
I'm not sure I've definitely seen the video of him

802
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,759
Chantilli I don't remember a guy on a motorcycle coming up and giving him

803
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,319
An archive of secret globalist

804
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,111
Bilderberg documents

805
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:39,999
I don't remember him going back to his hotel room in freaking out that some guy on a motorcycle gave him an archive

806
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Okay okay

807
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
Now we're both imagining this

808
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
What it how is he

809
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
He holding these

810
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,703
Document says he have a briefcase that's

811
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,775
Like handcuffed to his wrist and he has to go through a process

812
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
To give it to him

813
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,127
If you just wearing a messenger bag and he's like I here you go

814
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
Is it is it like in the ocean

815
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,271
12 or whatever where the you know I'm guessing it was Daniel

816
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,855
Motorcycle in the new just gave him his stupid book

817
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
There's big news on the way to Paramus

818
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
The night is that Alex has found

819
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
A triangle

820
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,887
Socially unacceptable

821
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,215
Boston in the ATL

822
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
This particular one is from Maryland and Virginia

823
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
And it says

824
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,711
Fathers are a form of

825
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,855
Parental parental

826
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
I'm going to cover that later

827
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
So what do you got is a triangle and it has like at the top there is a line

828
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:53,471
So that the smaller triangle and then the bottom of the triangle

829
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,263
Motorcycle is the unaccept

830
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Audible white supremacy

831
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,311
It's things like

832
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
The Klan lynchings

833
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,663
Shut up like that and that underneath is the more

834
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:07,551
Subtle metaphor

835
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Supremacy

836
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,903
Fathers are one of them

837
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:17,279
However I watch the video cuz I can't find anywhere else, I got to go find him

838
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,143
And I looked at it and know how to read

839
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
Parental it says

840
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
Paternalism

841
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Okay

842
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:33,407
Merriam-Webster defines paternalism as quota system under which an authority undertakes to supply needs or regulate conduct of

843
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,015
Those under its control in matters affecting them as individuals as well in their relations with authority

844
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Into each other

845
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,135
Paternalism is essentially believing that you can restrict another person or a group's actions

846
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
Because you understand their own good better than them

847
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
Alex has no idea about the word let alone concert

848
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Discovery

849
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
A piece of paper that claims that paternalistic attitude

850
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,911
Contributed covert white supremacy

851
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:59,007
The way he reported is that the sblc unity as having Fathers as whites

852
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,359
That is a bit of a jump

853
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
But I honestly don't

854
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
Think he knows

855
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
But it doesn't

856
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
Safe for rent

857
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,063
That would be most likely I would

858
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,927
It it feels like you misread that got mad about it and whether or not he's realized he's wrong

859
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,999
It's too good for him not to be mad about it

860
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,607
Cuz he'll never read it

861
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
It's not like he was like wait I got to double-check this

862
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
That's never happened

863
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
True

864
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Yeah

865
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
Parental ISM whatever that is under attack sure

866
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
It sounds crazy

867
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
Rena Phillips

868
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
Ilysm

869
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
My parental ism is it just you

870
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
You can't keep that father

871
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
You can't eat today

872
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,511
You can't keep saying it

873
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,583
Is believing in the nuclear family

874
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,911
You can Adventure

875
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,215
Racist I'm not

876
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,543
Sure the parental ism is a widespread concept

877
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,895
I was thinking that he could have misspoken

878
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,783
But still understood the word you do like telekinesis or when it was like yeah using the wrong word he means telepathy

879
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
And then he went

880
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,439
Further the prince was whose parents so we know

881
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Bohr effect

882
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
He does

883
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
Does not understand what was being said nobody

884
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,375
Still think it could be an instance of him this reading the word and then never

885
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Checking again

886
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
Sure sure but you know what it's embarrassing

887
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:39,103
Pretty funny different than the other misuse of the word

888
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Like

889
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
Like the telekinesis thing is just funny

890
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,479
It's okay I get you meme

891
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:51,135
Telepathy is creating parental is another thing to be mad about

892
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
That may or may not be an actual word

893
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
I mean I could find some uses of it online but it's

894
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
It's definitely not like

895
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
A word people use of snow it's not you don't

896
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:07,007
Find it cited in Psychiatry paper Hoover

897
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,871
Yeah it's ritualistic attitudes

898
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
I mean

899
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,503
Oh no I did the Alex paternalistic

900
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:23,903
My eyes went wide what's going to happen I know Alex got into my head

901
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,463
Most of the

902
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,767
Middle of the show middle to end of the show

903
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Is about Alex

904
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,887
About Alex

905
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,167
Talking about

906
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Joe Biden

907
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
President

908
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
Apparently he's blaming

909
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,079
The victims of the Tuskegee

910
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:42,847
Experiments

911
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
4

912
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,663
Black vaccine hesitancy

913
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
He's blaming the

914
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
Victim

915
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:55,135
Okay I have a hard time believing that but let's continue talking about it and then clip of bye

916
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,415
Matthew's to rationalize

917
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,999
Give me the speech today Joe Biden Wayne's black

918
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
Hesitancy on Tuskegee Airmen

919
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,935
The first black sister Civil War allowed in combat who did an excellent job

920
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:14,079
So you blamed black man

921
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Until

922
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,151
Port Orchard

923
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:23,039
Billions were allowed to be infected overall by the tens of thousands were ejected

924
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,135
Android now blames them the victims

925
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Poor

926
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
What happened

927
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,463
Well he's an old man

928
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,887
So I hear he is blaming

929
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
The very black

930
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Alabama

931
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,383
Who were victimized with a secret government experiment tell him it was a vaccine

932
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
The polio when it was syphilis

933
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
Now blaming them for what they did to him

934
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
Just lie so much you can't stop

935
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,415
I asked one person to do nothing but deal with

936
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Equity

937
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
To make sure that

938
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
We were reaching out

939
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Enderman Rd communities

940
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,631
Which by the way

941
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,727
And many of the older members of that Community had memories of

942
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,031
Experimentation on Black America

943
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,311
That we're not

944
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Told about

945
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
Like what happened

946
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
The in all the Tuskegee Airmen

947
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,255
For sure Flatirons you killed him huh

948
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Happened

949
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
And I misspoke and he said to

950
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,703
Tuskegee Airmen which were the group of black fighter pilots in World War II

951
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
Experiments

952
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
It's unfortunate gas in about this point here was that by

953
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Doesn't know that they

954
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,687
Difference between the two uses of the word Tuskegee I'd say that's probably a stretch but whatever

955
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
I don't really

956
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
Using this clip to argue that biting his

957
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
Blaming the victims of the experiment for vaccine hesitancy do that

958
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Absurd

959
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
That's

960
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Mom said I was listening to this

961
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
It's really

962
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
It doesn't say anything

963
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,071
Close to what Alex

964
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
They were biting the saying is that the memory

965
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
Free of this

966
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,471
It is this staying on on American history

967
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,543
This the shame is what would Kant

968
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Tribute to people

969
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Being hesitant to

970
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
To trust

971
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,407
I'll rollouts of large vaccine

972
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,943
Program

973
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
That thought is

974
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,063
Makes sense

975
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,719
No it's Alex is not missing the point he is like cutting the points Achilles tendons and then bearing Italy

976
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,279
Live in the backyard like this is this is

977
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
A way out of

978
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Control

979
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,167
Also a little bit later Alex makes the exact same mistake by Shore

980
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,103
Call my wife this rap group that Dudley pro-vaccine should have believed those

981
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Run DMC

982
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,807
I got a new one weird shows Tuskegee Airmen

983
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
Gigi folks and says

984
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:12,767
Yeah we injected yeah but we don't do that anymore we don't do experiments anymore experiment

985
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
I'm in Alex City exact same slip that dividing did

986
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,631
It's an easy mistake to make

987
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:25,055
People in one circumstance in if you do it like oh no

988
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,079
Steak

989
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
Yeah it's just a

990
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Stupid game

991
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,407
Yeah so

992
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
Rand Paul

993
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
He's he's made some

994
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,039
Disparaging comments about fauci at this point

995
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,855
Your answer Alex believe that he's going head-to-head

996
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
But the enemy

997
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
And maybe that means

998
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
But he should be present

999
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
To support

1000
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,631
Who's winning Paul deserves a lot of support on

1001
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,239
He's going directly at the enemy flies getting death threats

1002
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
I've been physically attacked twice

1003
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
Broken Islam

1004
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,919
I'm sure was a lawn are given

1005
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,503
I need a good heart very presidential

1006
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
Material

1007
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Mexican president

1008
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,623
Schmick's

1009
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,511
Black women like those guys

1010
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047
One second

1011
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,839
White male

1012
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
Who else who else is there

1013
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,335
Kielbasa mauro's wife's fine order on a saying

1014
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:34,943
For him

1015
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,319
Discussion about

1016
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
You do digress

1017
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,535
That is true can't believe that we have that conversation

1018
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,559
Yeah

1019
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,351
You're the one who brought it up

1020
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
Yeah I certainly didn't I wasn't like

1021
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,983
I wonder if bolsonaro's White knighting

1022
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:07,711
I did that was not on the top of my mind also my first response that I would have

1023
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:14,111
Did the idea of a Rand Paul DeSantis ticket

1024
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,439
To Whitefish

1025
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,767
Policy is that I would be really offended by

1026
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
First

1027
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
Here is Alex Van Dyke

1028
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Baby Come Back

1029
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
That's all

1030
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
It's

1031
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,079
Go to rant

1032
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Yeah

1033
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
Mayonnaise

1034
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
Haven't gone through that

1035
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,271
Disenchantment. With Rand Paul

1036
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
At the 2016 election

1037
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,087
Pretty funny to hear him say so

1038
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,367
Stuff like that cuz he knows

1039
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
You blew it

1040
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Yeah I know

1041
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
There's there's just

1042
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,487
Stihl dealer

1043
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Paul boat

1044
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
I wish I could

1045
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Stop

1046
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
Being at least a little bit surprised

1047
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
Howell crane

1048
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
You know

1049
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,495
No matter

1050
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
How Craven I see them

1051
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
I'm still like

1052
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
Your dad Craven

1053
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
Man

1054
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:15,039
Just pull in a week he's going to pretend that he didn't say that there's a fake Alien Invasion that's coming and they're going to not be able to

1055
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Themselves and then

1056
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,647
They're not tell us eventually bad aliens are coming

1057
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,327
He expect you to not remember that a week ago he had a big Revelation right before he got on air

1058
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
He's got a lot of Revelation

1059
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,983
I think you just expect him to have the radio show it

1060
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Ridiculous

1061
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,591
Tell me a fun with that being more fun radio show to listen to

1062
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,871
Certainly

1063
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,455
He said a lot of extreme stuff on this episode

1064
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,271
Some of it not as hateful as usual so we're just kind of

1065
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Dumb

1066
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
But you should know this

1067
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,671
We discredit these guys we send the prison but I kill everybody

1068
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Missouri weather

1069
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,071
It means everything

1070
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Of course

1071
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:03,679
Of course earlier in the show Alex it said that it's going to be open

1072
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,007
Open phones in the third and fourth hour is getting really pumped for it

1073
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Yes I'd love that

1074
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
30

1075
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:19,295
I was I was really I was really going out on a limb going more than zero I kind of expect

1076
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
0 but I'm really hoping

1077
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:25,951
I feel like whenever you take that bet it should be zero or if the field

1078
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,839
The over-under is 1.5

1079
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,655
Yes he takes none

1080
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
Couldn't do take

1081
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,727
Open phones

1082
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:43,103
The 4th hour cuz he initially he had Matt Bracken schedule today's the 4th

1083
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:50,271
Thursday's $4

1084
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,999
A bunch of things I'm working on.

1085
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,119
Very important behind-the-scenes I'mma leave it at that

1086
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,935
Had to go to Family Court

1087
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:15,615
Chad this is the night I believe

1088
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,151
That his ex-wife

1089
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,687
Was trying to live

1090
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
Stream a court

1091
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Appearance

1092
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
On YouTube

1093
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:29,439
Open hearing

1094
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:33,023
And people should know what's going on

1095
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,303
Answer I

1096
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:38,143
I would assume that that's more was on outside that a big story

1097
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191
Yeah it was

1098
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,543
Possibly going to be live stream

1099
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
Terrifying for him

1100
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Even at

1101
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
This point machote that's in the future

1102
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
We have to worry about

1103
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
Cuz now

1104
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Undercover news

1105
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,487
I got a bunch of other huge Governors as well

1106
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,791
And it's a really scary stuff

1107
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,327
Really mad and also

1108
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,887
The Abomination stuff all this cloning

1109
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
When the universe

1110
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Agadmator

1111
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
We're a musical instrument

1112
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,783
The best way to describe it

1113
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,367
Energetically

1114
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:34,463
Through the dimensions

1115
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
What it is

1116
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
Census

1117
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,399
Read write and talk when she couldn't hear and couldn't see but

1118
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
Figure it out

1119
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
Times were there

1120
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,335
Well spoken

1121
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,871
Person through communication

1122
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Wild

1123
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,919
Only you know

1124
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,991
But it was there and so

1125
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,039
Trying to describe this in

1126
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Let's just say

1127
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
Trying to describe what

1128
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,375
You know what's weird if you'd like

1129
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
I just

1130
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
Don't know how it is

1131
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,727
He could

1132
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
Really somehow be defensive towards

1133
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,591
Helen Keller like

1134
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,871
Helen Keller didn't

1135
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
Do any work

1136
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
It's that the people broke

1137
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,247
Through her

1138
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Defenses

1139
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,671
In order to get to what was already there inside

1140
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:43,071
Oh oh oh yeah yeah

1141
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Somehow I don't

1142
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,887
Know where your friends

1143
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
Helen Keller

1144
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,215
It is a little

1145
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
It seems like a

1146
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Stray thoughts

1147
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
A little bit

1148
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,103
I would guess that the people who worked with

1149
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Helen Keller

1150
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Wouldn't say like

1151
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
It's lucky the ark

1152
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,039
Archetypes were there

1153
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,623
I'm guessing that that would be the way that they would describe it

1154
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,207
So yeah the universe

1155
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Yeah

1156
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
Musical

1157
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,583
I know that when I was

1158
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
It doesn't fourth grade my parents

1159
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:24,031
Made me learn a musical instrument. But they said I couldn't play like drums or guitars didn't want to be in a rock band

1160
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
I took up the tree

1161
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,199
I didn't know where that was going did you got me

1162
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:44,511
Our bodies are musical instruments in reverse

1163
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
What's the best way to describe

1164
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,607
Look in the third dimension it's horrid limiting

1165
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,167
To talk about these things which I don't know what these things are

1166
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,727
I don't know what's going on I thought we were going to get to covid news

1167
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
I don't know what that

1168
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:59,103
I do I do like the scientist approved it

1169
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,943
Didn't everything's kind of like that

1170
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,551
Yeah The Music of the Spheres

1171
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,415
So what I've done now is I have just

1172
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Made

1173
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Cots

1174
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,023
This is one long steaks

1175
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
Okay is it a weird place

1176
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:26,495
Thought we were getting to the news you're talking about our bodies being musical instruments the third dimension

1177
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Look dude

1178
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
This is a mess

1179
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,663
This is a very primitive level of

1180
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
God's creation

1181
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
Azteca videos

1182
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
This

1183
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,087
Havasu Creek

1184
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Matter

1185
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,439
Sure

1186
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,231
Dimensions very very sad

1187
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
In the lower Dimensions witch

1188
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,471
It's even more

1189
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
More empty

1190
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,031
In the lower dementia

1191
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
Human term

1192
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
The lower

1193
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
Is up and down in ounces

1194
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
The game of thing

1195
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
No

1196
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
Yes

1197
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:14,367
Like it or not this is happening

1198
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,951
This is how we come back from vacation

1199
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,487
This Dimension is.

1200
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
I don't know what you're talkin about this dimension

1201
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
Olga creational level

1202
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
What does that mean

1203
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Look in the third dimension

1204
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
It's third-dimensional words are limited

1205
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
Just saying s***

1206
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
Space below

1207
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
Snapchat

1208
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
More empty

1209
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,503
Is it is it that mean it's thinner

1210
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,087
He thinks that the human term

1211
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:49,439
But I mean lizard place on that level

1212
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,487
We're talkin all the difference

1213
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,791
Between the levels of Dimension is Riley

1214
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
Measurable by thin or thick

1215
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:00,959
How many communities whenever they they talk about like these higher vibrations

1216
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,079
It's often referred to as a higher density or maybe Alex is taking that as like

1217
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:11,455
Alright actual dense I really I think

1218
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
You can

1219
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
Float easier in the fourth dimension I would have said you can the third dimension know I would I would assume if you have

1220
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,439
Have a lower density float more right

1221
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:30,399
Don't know cuz you're not talking about the environment is denser yeah yeah I had it backwards

1222
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Alright

1223
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,727
Yeah look

1224
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
We're engaging with too much

1225
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,919
Creation Ali

1226
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,551
He brings up his a good thought

1227
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Maybe if you're high

1228
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
Interested in your in college

1229
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Alright

1230
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
And that thought is this

1231
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,511
We always imagine

1232
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,279
That like

1233
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,351
Is aliens were to come down and contact us

1234
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,143
Baby so much more advanced

1235
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
That's the nice man

1236
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,727
I think we leave

1237
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:11,103
Experience this in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Shore

1238
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
Who's experienced this

1239
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,199
Plenty of

1240
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
Bias towards

1241
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,087
Anything that would contact us would have to be far more advanced than us

1242
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,671
That's not the case I mean if we can't contact them but they

1243
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:29,535
Can contact us that would suggest that at least on some level they have an ability for me

1244
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Right

1245
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583
The contacting across

1246
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,679
But I know for sure so weird theoretically

1247
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:40,287
Opening the possibility to a Intergalactic spacefaring race

1248
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,175
Anything in this great big marble little world

1249
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
Okay anyways

1250
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
Thought

1251
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:55,135
I'm going out of my way to give some credibility or Credence here cuz the rest of the Saudis stupid okay

1252
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,279
Interfacing with other things and like oh it must be advanced

1253
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
No

1254
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,447
Interface with us without our free will

1255
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Is low

1256
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,007
Wow then

1257
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Lucifer

1258
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,103
Who does come from one dimension higher

1259
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,527
With all the other dark energy

1260
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,343
Falling in the human world

1261
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Right right right

1262
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
Right

1263
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,695
So

1264
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,999
Is Step Up

1265
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:37,119
I mean maybe maybe what he's trying to say is that Satan isn't really a bad guy but

1266
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
He just needs

1267
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Debris thinner air

1268
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,727
I mean

1269
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
No I don't think so

1270
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,543
Kind of

1271
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
Attractive some of the other ideas he has

1272
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,943
No I ain't seen this one level higher

1273
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,991
And he's a lying with the stuff

1274
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:58,623
Who knows why I'm not I'm not messing with that right I'm not messing with the Y on this one

1275
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Certainly not

1276
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Yeah

1277
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
I got nothing

1278
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
Let's just move on

1279
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,895
What

1280
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,479
Road signs

1281
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
That's not

1282
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,879
We have to create our own terms

1283
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
Even understand interface with the cosmos

1284
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,023
Which itself again is just an expression of God

1285
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
I'm not saying troglodyte

1286
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
Preachers that aren't really Christians they think they are

1287
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
What is

1288
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,543
That I worship the creation no no no

1289
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,871
Made all this

1290
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,711
And if I create a piece of art that is an expression of who I am

1291
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,527
That is a very primitive

1292
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,063
Form of

1293
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,183
Making something that has consciousness

1294
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
And Free Will Will

1295
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,535
Guess what God gives you a little taste of that Acquire

1296
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,143
Quite a few times were made me image of God

1297
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
Poor little G

1298
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
What do you take away from that

1299
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,895
What do I take away from well

1300
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,455
Blasphemy

1301
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Well

1302
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Make a call

1303
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,087
Well the idea of

1304
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
Comparing yourself to

1305
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
Did God by simply little bit

1306
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
Size of

1307
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,023
The G would still technically really beat

1308
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,047
Construed as

1309
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
Calling yourself somewhat equal to God

1310
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
Which I think

1311
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,703
Now I don't know if I've read the Bible enough

1312
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
X

1313
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
Pretty big on the door

1314
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
Do scale

1315
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,335
Yeah

1316
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
I mean

1317
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,687
What is made in the image of really mean

1318
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
Telekinesis

1319
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,039
Total

1320
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,343
A million percent

1321
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Yeah I was looking for a thesis

1322
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
I'm not finding

1323
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
I think that was your mistake

1324
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
That was

1325
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,119
Attitude

1326
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,679
Lesson I refused to learn

1327
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,263
So here you have an interesting perspective that you think

1328
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,103
The capitalization on God doesn't mean all that much

1329
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
Think I'll expensive.

1330
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,991
Also he thinks he's

1331
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Got the

1332
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,599
Personal connection to God that gives him Visions all the time

1333
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,415
But he's not God capital

1334
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Fluttershy

1335
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
Satan

1336
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
Okay

1337
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
He comes down

1338
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,839
From is an address which is

1339
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,935
48

1340
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
He comes down

1341
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
How you doing

1342
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:01,663
Your God that you are God

1343
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,503
In the fourth dimension and a lowercase s in the third dimension

1344
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
I never thought about it I always

1345
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Consider to be a proper noun

1346
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,159
Me too

1347
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,487
Fungible

1348
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
Poor little G

1349
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
Okay

1350
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,287
2001 Space Odyssey

1351
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,591
Go through this process should come back as a

1352
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,359
Starchild

1353
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Reincarnate

1354
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
Implant the egg that is Earth and create

1355
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
The new Lucifer

1356
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
Well that's that's just a tan

1357
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
Papi chocolate

1358
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,367
Satanic poppycock

1359
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,183
I thought it was maybe a little bit

1360
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,999
Long but I didn't necessarily

1361
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
Construe it as satanic

1362
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,167
Well it's fair you are not the most reliable

1363
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,519
Cinematic reveal

1364
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:05,663
Over I miss that and Ebert's review but I supposed it was all unspoken

1365
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
Bright

1366
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,783
All about the Titanic poppycock

1367
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Nism

1368
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Cavalry

1369
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,487
Do you know the stuff in 2000's

1370
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,047
Might be just as real

1371
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,583
As Frankenstein

1372
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,143
Well that's that's just satanic Papi chocolate

1373
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
I am

1374
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,615
What God is actually create

1375
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,687
2001 Space Odyssey

1376
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,855
He's very

1377
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Close to actually

1378
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
What's going on

1379
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,231
And I'll just leave it at that

1380
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:59,167
Don't know what's news

1381
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,591
Acura rudimentary special effects

1382
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,223
So special that I got to get back to the news on a certain level

1383
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Please do not

1384
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:20,671
Are you say something like that

1385
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,719
What's in the news

1386
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Boo

1387
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,071
So 50 is it so

1388
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
50 years ago special effects were very similar to

1389
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
What they had

1390
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Then

1391
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,263
So would you say that special effects of

1392
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Gotten better enough

1393
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
They are what they have now

1394
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Or is it like

1395
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
Proportional

1396
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:51,391
Are are special effects true to what they were to what reality was 50 years ago and now it's 50 years

1397
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,671
Ahead of what we have

1398
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,279
I don't have to be right that's the only thing that makes plantar if the

1399
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,911
Evil globalist are implanting secret messages and they control all those cinemedia

1400
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
It's not like they would

1401
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,495
Give access to like Secret

1402
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,287
Technologies for

1403
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Special effects

1404
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:12,383
Right so Andy Serkis only has a career because of a lie

1405
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:19,807
I think that's what I'm hearing I don't know about that whether or not.

1406
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
Cinema world

1407
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,391
Is privy to those those futuristic

1408
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
Technology

1409
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Congress is Godzilla's real

1410
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,071
So back to the news that's where it is

1411
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:31,839
The cervix

1412
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:37,471
Excursion into lunacy

1413
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,775
That weirded me out so much

1414
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,567
Like I said I was

1415
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Like what

1416
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Trying to

1417
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,127
Express

1418
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
This is

1419
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
It seems like just kind of

1420
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
Bit of standard

1421
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,551
S*** hedary's from like

1422
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,343
New Age space

1423
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:59,999
Conspiracy communities

1424
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,023
Dumb nonsense Rogan

1425
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,583
I could see

1426
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:09,983
Somebody who wouldn't get invited on Rogan but really want almost starting at all

1427
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,543
I want that one tier below

1428
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,103
I don't see a lot of depth

1429
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Here

1430
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:20,479
I just see Killing Time

1431
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
And then Alex

1432
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,063
Angry about his not sure

1433
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
Life is only an experience

1434
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
A free-will that God created

1435
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
Is the only thing God can create

1436
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,047
Separate from God is all-knowing all Powerball controlling

1437
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,631
Omnipotent omnipresent Beyond quilt

1438
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:43,263
Is creatures with free will that create other creature

1439
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,847
Free world

1440
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
We have been made

1441
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
Ball

1442
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
It doesn't want to be alone

1443
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
And so

1444
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Put us on this planet

1445
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:13,215
Away from other things so we don't kill everything

1446
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Wall-E

1447
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,799
Run around inside our Nursery

1448
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,383
And what does God put in the nursery

1449
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,919
Majestic creation

1450
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Puts a lot of nasty

1451
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Stop

1452
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,527
That's weird

1453
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
What are weird God

1454
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,879
What a weird guy on the radio

1455
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,951
You know what I was thinking when he was listening to this I was like

1456
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
This

1457
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Alex

1458
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:43,167
Turned into like the like I remember when I was growing up there was the small town Church

1459
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,775
15 to 20 people in it a sort of the revivalist preachers

1460
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
I don't want to know what goes on there

1461
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
It's none of our business and we just stay out of

1462
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,455
It's loud

1463
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,759
There's something going on but we just

1464
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:02,367
What you taste like a black hole in this small town wherever it is kind of avoid that out of

1465
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:09,023
Instinct I think I might have gone to a couple of those churches and I think I know what you mean there was one moment in his thing

1466
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,583
Thing that really hit home like in that way for me

1467
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:14,399
That Matt is the like when he's yelling about

1468
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:18,239
Like we were created by an all-powerful being

1469
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
And there's a pause and the

1470
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,567
Who doesn't want to be alone

1471
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,615
It's the anger the pause

1472
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,175
Does MMS off delivery of this ideas

1473
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,967
Created us to keep him

1474
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,807
Or whatever you can hear it I got it

1475
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
That's just

1476
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Evangelist

1477
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:37,183
Church where there were snakes before I've heard this

1478
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,743
Rhythm in Cadence's is

1479
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Is very

1480
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,839
Temperature kind of

1481
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,655
Everything that I thought about when I heard that clip was

1482
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,751
About like it did naming of his website is prisonplanet

1483
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,567
Really interesting to me the way that like

1484
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
If you think

1485
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,639
He's just this guy who's into Political

1486
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
Conspiracies and like

1487
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,479
Hey if a One World Government comes into play

1488
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,039
Yes and they turn into a tyrannical dictatorship

1489
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
We are on a prison planet you can't get off

1490
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,903
If there's nowhere to run

1491
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
If there's a One World Government doesn't

1492
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
Control of everywhere on Earth

1493
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,023
Is a Prison Planet

1494
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
What are you looking at the way he's kind of

1495
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
Talking now

1496
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
It's more like

1497
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
You know

1498
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
The Earth nursery idea it's

1499
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
It's kind of like he's saying that like

1500
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
You know I'm in a crib

1501
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
Crib

1502
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,687
And this weird guy threw a scorpion in here

1503
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:37,087
Yeah you know I got pushed into the deep end when I was five and you swim or you die

1504
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,111
That kind of thing

1505
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:41,695
Yeah and it also implies that there's a bunch of other alien

1506
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,999
Things on other planets

1507
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:48,095
On other planets through whatever we're going through

1508
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
I mean if God's lonely

1509
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,495
It seems to reason that

1510
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,543
Maybe he's lonely enough to make more

1511
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:02,431
You know and so he's just running this shell game

1512
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,711
Suggest that maybe

1513
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
How is it possible that

1514
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
The whole thing

1515
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
I've gotten lonely

1516
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
Pisces still lonely

1517
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:16,255
Escalation you know you what you get what you want and you find out you just want more

1518
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,351
God's not immune to that kind of thing

1519
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,143
Seems like

1520
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
Is a lot of people who've lived

1521
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:32,639
If you need some company there's plenty of options

1522
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
If he's so lonely

1523
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:39,551
You know why not just make some people and keep them around a party

1524
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,343
To get be in the nursery sure

1525
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,135
Got a deal with the Scorpion

1526
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,415
And then get out of crib

1527
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
It's a really babyish idea

1528
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,327
Well I mean really it's simulator

1529
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,911
More similar I would say to the wheel of reincarnation then anything else

1530
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,703
You know that idea of like

1531
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:02,591
You're constantly being tested through throughout time until you become a full beard

1532
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,895
And then you would send me under

1533
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:10,015
Yeah but I don't know I don't know how Alex is ideas about reincarnation work

1534
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Exactly

1535
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,831
I know that he thinks that you're literally Rancid

1536
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
Tronos Petra

1537
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,951
But I don't have that works with ancestors that are

1538
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,279
Concurrently alive that's fair

1539
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:24,863
I don't I don't I don't really understand any of that

1540
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
In between

1541
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191
You doesn't really articulate a lot of that stuff

1542
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,495
I don't know if it is

1543
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,263
Like

1544
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
A situation where where he believes in

1545
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
The reincarnated

1546
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Casino that kind of

1547
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,503
Yeah it's weird yeah that is weird

1548
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,783
Anyway

1549
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Is dumb

1550
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
So there is some news

1551
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,207
Alex has been building up to this news but I didn't realize it

1552
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,535
I have such a hard time remembering that this is got a news

1553
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,871
I didn't feel like you've been building this up for an hour

1554
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:11,455
I felt like he got distracted but bulshit

1555
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:18,623
I know teasing Alex

1556
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:23,487
That we've experienced that over and over again on the show.

1557
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,095
I'm going to cover this

1558
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:32,191
Go stand over the highway with a

1559
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,527
Understudy

1560
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,831
University of Louisville

1561
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,927
Gun show

1562
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,767
Any signs or any evidence that they help.

1563
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
Define

1564
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,191
A review study

1565
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,239
Came out

1566
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,823
Is there's people asked questions about methodology of it

1567
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,127
And even under ideal circumstances

1568
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,455
Assuming that you know it goes through. View and stands up

1569
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
The scrutiny

1570
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
Still isn't saying that masks art

1571
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,575
Effective it was looking

1572
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
Larger populations make

1573
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,439
Estimates based on whether or not mask mandates

1574
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
Had an effect

1575
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,863
On a larger population individual level whether or not masks

1576
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
Had any effect

1577
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,191
In terms of actual train

1578
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:40,031
Plenty of studies that have actually looked at the question.

1579
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
2 pretending to study answers

1580
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Ima

1581
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,383
Routinely

1582
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
I assume that they do

1583
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
They are

1584
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,247
Yeah it maybe not 100% effective

1585
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,295
But they are effective in as much as

1586
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
It's something you can do right

1587
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
Right right

1588
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,879
As opposed to nothing

1589
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,743
This is about something different than what he is

1590
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
Saying it is

1591
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,535
And then

1592
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Secondarily

1593
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,095
Too early

1594
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
To really take it as solid

1595
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,959
Like a bed Rocco's of of a

1596
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Sloppy

1597
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,152
That means and you if he says study say I

1598
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,688
I always hear you say

1599
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,760
He's referencing an on. Study like that

1600
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
Then that's that's something that

1601
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
It's weird

1602
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
You know like

1603
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,464
He says the study it's a non-peer-reviewed saying that

1604
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
It's on like a preprint

1605
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,280
Or something

1606
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,560
Maybe we'll get

1607
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,352
Peer-reviewed or maybe won't

1608
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,168
And then you'll just forget about it you'll never know where it ends up

1609
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
The same thing with bills like if you look back at like these pastimes on his show he actually

1610
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Talked about

1611
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:51,712
News more he would have these bills that he complained about and they are always things that ended up dying and committee

1612
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,504
They're always bills that are like

1613
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,832
Can you believe someone's doing X wires either died

1614
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
I can

1615
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
I also know that that

1616
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
Is never going to even get a

1617
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,440
Yeah

1618
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
It's kind of the same thing

1619
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,280
He's preemptively

1620
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,304
Making

1621
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,584
Everything a huge deal

1622
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,656
That's one of the reasons why I can't do

1623
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:14,752
The coverage of the police state three that I wanted to do

1624
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:19,360
It's almost entirely about doesn't happen

1625
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
It's

1626
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Yesterday's say

1627
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
Next sentence

1628
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:28,832
Not a review

1629
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:32,416
Hb20 33 next sentence died in committee

1630
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Yeah

1631
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
So we won't last quip here

1632
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
And this is

1633
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,328
Example of why

1634
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,864
Everything in Alex's world is

1635
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,728
Quarters u.s. Intel to analyze information

1636
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,776
Impossible Rihanna tablet

1637
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
I need cover it up

1638
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
Stooges

1639
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,552
I ordered by The Kill

1640
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Doesn't

1641
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,512
Investigate the theory that there was

1642
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
A lab origin

1643
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
Ted coronavirus Shoreline it's a cover-up and if he does

1644
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,936
Do an investigation of it it's a cover-up

1645
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,520
Doesn't matter the reality and what happens don't matter

1646
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,312
This pendant is intact no matter what

1647
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,920
The only way Alex would allow for something to be real

1648
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
Would be if Trump

1649
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
Himself

1650
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,992
Was running

1651
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,016
This Commission

1652
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:33,088
And the only conclusion that they even make

1653
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,624
Accepted from the beginning

1654
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,416
Is that not only

1655
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
Was this a bio-weapon released

1656
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
McKay matters at lab

1657
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,304
But she

1658
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:46,400
Cool Hand salute

1659
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,960
Chile is a

1660
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Pizza is

1661
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
Is it

1662
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,032
Special kind of virus

1663
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:56,896
Directly if you look at the molecules that spells out communists

1664
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:03,296
On the virus unit like that level of b*******

1665
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,112
That's why

1666
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Get off

1667
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,952
The whole lot of this stuff is just

1668
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,376
Seriously inasmuch as like there's dangerous consequences of it and it was straight

1669
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Of

1670
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,424
Bad thought patterns

1671
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,192
Certainly

1672
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,008
But like when you hear stuff like that like you should

1673
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
You should recognize that like

1674
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
This is how he preached

1675
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,384
Every yeah yeah everything is okay

1676
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Yep

1677
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,688
Doesn't matter

1678
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:33,504
B b to do X

1679
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,040
Spider do why

1680
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,624
Either way the decision tree for what Alex is going to say about it is

1681
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Yeah it's like

1682
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
Preparing for a disaster

1683
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
You hate

1684
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
You say that

1685
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
Preparing for the disaster

1686
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Makes it happen

1687
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
If it does happen

1688
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,168
Or if it doesn't happen you say that by revealing that the preparation

1689
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
For the disaster would make it happen

1690
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
Excuse

1691
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:00,384

01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,944
Total eclipse

1693
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
It's just a trap

1694
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,784
Yeah you you create a universe where you always win

1695
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:12,160
And then you never have to feel bad about yourself so why would you go back to the real Universe you know

1696
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Sounds fun

1697
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,488

Knowledge underscore

1706

We are going to be like the Dallas Zoo could please find a local charity or Bellefontaine area to help out people doing

1707
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:00,800
But until then I'm Niro I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark
