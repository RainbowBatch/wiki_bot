Do some experience

23
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
Afterwards

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024

And then they just took her to a river and told her to pray to Aqua Buddha

60
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
And that's the end of the story

61
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Right

62
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,823

Okay

113
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Flash Forward

114
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
26 months from now Alex's cell

115
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
I feel like

116
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
He's going to be like I don't

117
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Better

118
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,071
So we we start on the 3rd here on Monday

119
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,887
And Alex

120
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
In advance

121
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,799
In no way takes responsibility for stopping the antifa attacks that were alleged

122
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Supposed to bring up that they didn't happen

123
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
That seems really important to at least Menchie's

124
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
Days building up a narrative about how it was going to take over police station

125
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,767
Exaggerations

126
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:11,167
From a blue Facebook group group worth getting

127
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Yeah anyway that all

128
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Google Dowden know Wheatley

129
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
He's going to remove

130
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Computer chip from someone

131
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
No no you going to start

132
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Akash

133
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,343
I thought about doing a podcast once a week for I don't speak

134
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
From my own analysis the world but where I only High

135
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Highlight articles

136
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,423
That the podcast reading different sections of articles

137
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
Video clips

138
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
To do that I didn't want your podcast to

139
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:56,479
The show we know we know you intend to do that even tend to do that for

140
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,039
About the amount of time

141
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
What was

142
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
Audiobook of the news was that it

143
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
I'm going to do a show where I just read that

144
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
And that's

145
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Different

146
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Because it wouldn't have the parts where you scream

147
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
It wouldn't

148
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
It was

149
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Undoubtedly

150
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Just stop there

151
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Only knows how to do one

152
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,879
In honor of this idea for this podcast that he has

153
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,975
I'm just going to read headlines for the rest of the second

154
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
A lot of things that are important to be done

155
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:49,215
Because their fastest of the show I've always wanted to do that I've never had the will to do

156
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
What's today

157
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Relieved

158
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
5 minutes left

159
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Headlight

160
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
He ends up making it I mean he does

161
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Frequently interject with his own analysis

162
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Outside like

163
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Okay what have you proved

164
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
He can do it and you can just

165
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Completely disjointed

166
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,655
Connected headlight yes

167
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
What do you need it for

168
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
Man it's bad it's really bad it is

169
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
You can tell the audio's a little bit we

170
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Call Mandi background

171
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Something something is not quite right disconnected

172
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
Because of the way Alex's mom

173
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Connect to make sense

174
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,255
You can feel him having trouble just reading a bunch of headlines

175
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
Stories he hasn't read

176
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Audio formats

177
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,287
Miserable

178
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
The impulse

179
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,663
To be like this is all about the same thing

180
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,063
So I found it Rob do incompetent deposition experts

181
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
Incompetent news director real weirdo

182
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Drunk

183
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
C-pack

184
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Do you have anything nice to say

185
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
Drunk at CPAC

186
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
He's hired

187
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Idea of the

188
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Going up windshield

189
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Let's go down

190
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,039
Overhears condemning CDC stats show flu death drop

191
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Increase

192
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Number

193
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Every state following NIH guidelines

194
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327

195
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
Headline

196
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
I don't know what

197
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
To prove

198
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,663
It's it's interesting to me because I would have to either know that he's lying

199
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Or he has to have been

200
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:13,343
Tricked by the scale manipulation the grass are presented in

201
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
The show

202
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,767
Glee identical Rises installed the same number of people there

203
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
It's all out of

204
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
Somehow I feel like it

205
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
You know like he knows you lying

206
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
But he's been tricked by the grass so it doesn't know what

207
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Exactly

208
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
He's lying about

209
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
Eli

210
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,871
I think that's an interesting possibility and here's what I would say

211
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Like because we can't be certain

212
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
It's either a lie or he's so hopeless

213
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
And lost

214
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
He's helpless

215
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
That's what I mean

216
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
Galatians of things like an image

217
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,255
Right you just doesn't even doesn't know where he's at either way

218
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Rockin ignore it

219
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:00,191
So here's another story this is kind of one of the big headlines about the news

220
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Of the day and

221
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
I believe that

222
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
He got this just from a Gateway pundit

223
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Headline

224
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
It's really dumb

225
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
And gay or holding

226
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Miles on how

227
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Best to persuade

228
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Nutbush

229
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Quad Force

230
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Covid-19 vaccine

231
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
Online thesaurus please and type in

232
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Words for persuade

233
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Force

234
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Force

235
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
There's a Gateway pundit article about States conducted by

236
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
What sort of messaging is most

237
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
Effective in terms of getting people to take vaccines

238
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,479
There are 12 different messages that they would give study participants and then they evaluate their willingness

239
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Mystic

240
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Yeah

241
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
The control group was given the message that was unrelated to vaccine

242
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Just a quote

243
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Pastor Johnny cost

244
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
And benefits

245
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Bird feeding

246
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,559
There was the Baseline group straight message

247
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Text regarding vaccine

248
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,215
Experimental in nature ranging from messages about personal freedom

249
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
Two messages about how embarrassing it would be to knock

250
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Pocketbacs tomatoes

251
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,663
Is a pretty standard store to us or to study measuring the effectiveness of a particular type of message

252
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,247
Every advertising campaign does this as do politician

253
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
You're running for office

254
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
And I imagine

255
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Probably

256
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
Any kind of public relations matter is benefited

257
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,487
From studying how the public generally responds to a particular sort of message

258
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Not weird at all

259
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Also as Alex's reporting

260
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
That this is a federal government there's no evidence

261
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
The federal government is involved in the study at all

262
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,055
The list of sponsors and collaborators is literally just Yale

263
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,711
I think what happened here is that Jim hoft over at Gateway pundit found this study on clinicaltrials.gov

264
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
And because of the. Gov website

265
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
He just decided to report that this is a federal government

266
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
And now Alex is just blindly repeating that assertion

267
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:01,535
It tells me that neither of them actually went to the study page which is very clearly says of the top

268
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,607
Quote the safety and scientific validity of this study

269
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
Is a responsibility to study sponsor and investigator

270
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,311
Listing of study does not mean that it has been evaluated by the US federal government

271
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
There's a link to a

272
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,687
Disclaimer that makes us even more explicit

273
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
Clinicaltrials.gov National Institutes of Health

274
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
US Federal

275
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Not all listed studies are regulated and or reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration or other governmental

276
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Agencies

277
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
Information on clinicaltrials.gov is provided by study sponsors and investigators and they are responsible for ensuring

278
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
These studies follow all applicable

279
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
And regulations

280
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
MLM staff do not verify

281
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Scientific

282
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,479
Of the submitted information limited quality control review

283
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Preparing errors deficiencies and inconsistent

284
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
That's just

285
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
Nonsense the federal government

286
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,047
Probably probably

287
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,887
Assumption based on the disclaimer

288
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,983
Story

289
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,055
We just being completely misrepresented in order to make

290
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
Alex's audience that is addicted to being scared

291
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,455
A real problem

292
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
This is just Alex reporting on some new story he hasn't read whatever

293
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
Bulshit

294
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Pundit now we're getting

295
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Set it through

296
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Does his own

297
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Jazz

298
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
That really is is worrying

299
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
What was that Baseline

300
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Personal freedom message

301
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
Is a

302
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,855
He's reading that Gateway pundit article about this study about messaging

303
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Because he's just reading words and making up a story

304
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,511
He thinks that control message is a message about control

305
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
As opposed to it being the control group of the study

306
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
The same is true about the Baseline group

307
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,215
He sees these words and he's just reporting to his audience they mean something

308
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Completely different than what they do

309
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Like this

310
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,335
This is indicative of

311
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Failure to recognize

312
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
Studies even on

313
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
This is an in-depth

314
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Level of

315
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Ignorance

316
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,671
Nowell if you understood how controls

317
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
And experiments

318
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
You'd be like

319
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
So you have to

320
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Did not understand how it works in order to lie better about

321
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
About it you know what I'm saying

322
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Like it's a pretty foolproof, do you know there

323
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
Controls

324
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,895
God I don't even want to address that this is embarrassing

325
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
Oh yeah it's terrifying

326
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,783
Even if you're somebody who loves Alex and thinks like he's great

327
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
You should know like if you've gone through High School

328
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Control group

329
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Are what make it

330
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,535
You know that's the thing that's in experiments that is in order

331
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
To test

332
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Four variables

333
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Like you should know that very

334
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
I'm just

335
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,495
He was busy fighting influences when he was in

336
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
It's staggering

337
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
It's bad but I am not

338
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,735
Listening to this

339
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Reply

340
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Just being like

341
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
He doesn't know what it can

342
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
True group and can understand

343
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
I guess I cuz they don't

344
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Understand what

345
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Control group

346
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,303
Maybe that most of these people

347
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
Don't actually understand what their talk

348
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Like.

349
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
On a fundamental level

350
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
They don't

351
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
Lego like who's the who's the senator that just tested positive for covid

352
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Debate me on that

353
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,503
Gobert

354
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Itself gave me

355
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
You just don't understand

356
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
You got none

357
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,791
Alex gets

358
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Of course my friend

359
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,119
My only friend

360
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Beyond

361
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
My friends my only friends

362
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Verilife

363
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Plans the end

364
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
No safety

365
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
You're going to pay for submitting

366
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
So bad you better stop a bang but then you'll be so domesticated

367
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:53,375
Brains that you won't have any face but you go ahead and take the pill and kill yourself

368
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,959
That's where you're going and remember

369
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Cut off cut off by the brake there

370
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,663
Certainly

371
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
Patriot leadership

372
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
I was thinking

373
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
At Valley Forge

374
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
George Washington

375
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
Together and he was like

376
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Dino

377
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,208
Donovan's have any feet I get it

378
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
It's cold

379
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
And we're all going to die

380
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
We're all going to die

381
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
You are going to die

382
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
You're going to die

383
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Pay for your crimes

384
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
Everyone here is going to die

385
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
Give up

386
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
Yeah we trying to fight the British to be begging for death eventually

387
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
I don't know

388
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,832
Sort of like

389
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,136
This consistent pattern.

390
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Just keeps going

391
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
This this world like

392
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
There's a fatalism

393
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Do it Thursday

394
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,120
We're already in the pesos

395
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah the globalist

396
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Remnants

397
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Not good

398
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Kind of

399
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Mid

400
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Stage

401
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
This self-destructive Cult of Personality

402
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,272
He's at no point in time did he call it a divine wind it or ask

403
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,624
Play news

404
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
You should definitely not use

405
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
I'd like you to

406
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,048
On,

407
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
August seventy-year-old retired military people

408
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,176
Back to July

409
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,736
Actually I

410
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
Like I even have this quote at the ready

411
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Alex has been talking about this

412
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
For a while

413
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,184
This is all been set up to make you obsolete to dehumanize you

414
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
To suck the life out of you to dumb you down

415
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
Protect your family away from you

416
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,216
I don't want to be part of it

417
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Plan

418
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,616
About you and plan

419
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
We have

420
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Talking about

421
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
What we're going to do

422
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
We can't just sit here

423
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,464
The leadership of the operation might be down the road.

424
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
Black

425
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,144
Is it going to start

426
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
It's been going on a much

427
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Moreover

428
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Certainly

429
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
In the last month

430
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
And so

431
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
I mean it doesn't

432
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
I'm thrilled about

433
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,208
I was just thinking about how Jesus said like how you treat the least

434
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Diseases how you treat me

435
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
And

436
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,120
I feel like Alex wants to strap a bomb to the least of these

437
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Do you know what I mean

438
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
I don't I don't

439
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,776
So

440
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
Sort of more

441
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
Palatable

442
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Territory

443
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,152
I guess

444
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
Alex I think isn't Ancient Aliens

445
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
How old

446
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
Sumerian symbol of two snakes together

447
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Poor

448
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
The metal

449
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
Creatures Came From Another Star

450
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Now we work

451
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:39,680
British scientist all do this but they do to really get the knowledge in his excuse your mouth of drugs

452
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,200
Alien technology through Intergalactic space time

453
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Keep going

454
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,320
Earth

455
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
Bring them in the Bible says in the end time

456
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,720
The Gates of Hell will open hell will open

457
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Sure

458
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Yelm

459
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
This is

460
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:13,728
Just Project Camelot stop lighter leadership

461
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
The California wildfires are a cover for

462
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
Wild

463
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,504
Cool Russell coming back

464
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Coming back he was going to be in the galaxy

465
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,536
What's the most reliable sources and that's why I want to reach you from Erich von daniken

466
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
The Bible even says it

467
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
My next guest coming up

468
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
I think he's dead

469
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
Marion

470
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,896
Predate the Bible

471
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,200
And he's going off them

472
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Actually meeting alien

473
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,784
Then that supersedes

474
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
The Bible

475
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:06,720
You know I'm saying shouldn't we be listening to the alien folks more than probably probably irrelevant

476
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Flashbang I don't know

477
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,936
Okay smoked okay

478
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,288
And

479
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,896
I think just a little bit racist dance

480
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
What's going on here

481
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Alex

482
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,808
Seems to have a lot of victimhood narrative has had

483
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,880
And leads to

484
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
The statement

485
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,768
Guy in the super rare event you're in some Town 2kkk that's something to you

486
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
Super rare

487
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
White person incredibly common

488
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,336
Credibly common event that a black person attacks you because your wife

489
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
Do statistics are then covered up

490
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
Part of the PowerPlay

491
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
Did the globalist Deep state

492
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,624
6

493
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
Plus billion people that aren't White

494
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
We convinced them to hate white people

495
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:17,632
Pull down the first world ended no one has a chance of getting out of any of this

496
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
So that's that's that's an interest

497
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,984
Perspective that is racist

498
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,784
Because they cover up any proof that you would have whatever it is that I'm

499
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,648
The KKK who even ever heard of them what are you talkin about

500
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,536
People all the time

501
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,352
Racist attack against the non-white person

502
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
It wasn't Clan

503
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
I believe

504
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
He is

505
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,896
100%

506
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Trees are white

507
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,456
Yeah

508
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:13,184
Nancy Pelosi is talking about how people should get a stimulus

509
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
And

510
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
What is getting mad about

511
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Badger

512
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
And then

513
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Real non-sequitur on us

514
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
We need to stand up the American people

515
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:29,824
You talking about the American people by way of making sure people can

516
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Eat

517
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
When they're paid agitator say

518
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Snowboarders

519
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,736
So you are saying at all

520
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
So now Alex's implying

521
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
The Nancy Pelosi

522
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
Is funding all of the protests

523
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,720
Of people who largely are not fans of her

524
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,072
Philadelphia Police Department auction says the official budget

525
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Telldunkin

526
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
They can blow up the police station

527
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Going down all the statues

528
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,848
Money and give us their leftist organization their steezing

529
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
Fire

530
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,784
We'll have a new police department under our control he said it last week

531
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,624
Inter-Community wonderful

532
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,488
Didn't Somalia lady we saved you

533
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,816
Piston AR face go to hell

534
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
I didn't bug last hour I'm going to plug right now

535
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,264
Your financial support is obviously the total Zeitgeist we proven were in the center of the fight

536
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
Your financial support the spirit of the times

537
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
Weird

538
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Yeah

539
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,528
Conversation

540
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,648
She set up the Somali and State

541
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:54,560
Isaiah child refugees

542
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
I like to imagine that

543
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
City council has like

544
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
Controlled demolition of

545
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:07,104
Derelict police station

546
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
Second nap

547
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Also I checked into it

548
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
The preparation of this episode because earlier today Austin

549
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Budget

550
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
Police Department

551
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:26,048
Unapproved

552
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
So Alex is talking about

553
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
Make sense

554
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
You might have

555
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Jokes

556
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Some people

557
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Doesn't

558
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Ouchie

559
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
I mean come on

560
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,896
I would come on

561
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:45,504
Jamaica mon

562
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Serious an issue for me

563
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
Because their safety issues cuz you mean Bill Gates is coming accidentally vaccines that he says water doesn't kill us because we don't have a choice

564
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,352
Anyone coming to try to force me in oxalate you are take your job and I'll let you fly

565
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
Assaulting you

566
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
Prison for not taking her poison

567
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
So we are Crossing into an area where

568
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,104
The default does become violence

569
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
And the person we would talk about would be the frontman of this

570
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
Bill Gates

571
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
That's not my place

572
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,648
Attempts on their lives that turn them into victims affected probably going to Stage that

573
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,208
I don't wish any harm

574
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,000
Physically but their names

575
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,072
Should we destroy their own statements around corruption and onwards

576
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
Alex tries to be pretty

577
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,008
Like Trump in the military needs

578
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,104
Sure sure

579
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,152
Although it is

580
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
Fake attempt on their life

581
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,784
To get sympathy

582
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
You think everything is a weird conspiracy game

583
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,352
Garner sympathy for Fryeburg dr. fauci

Choking so much

586
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
As a defense against

587
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Dr. fauci

588
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,664
That is exactly what he would do seems

589
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,368
Some people Trump should probably do it and

590
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,672
I don't know he doesn't feel on

591
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464

602
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680

Upstate New York

607
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,416
Snitches

I should also tell you like you are from

609
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
I looked at this little bit and there's a number of places in Upstate New York that have pretty high burglary race

610
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,496
How old is what's his guy is saying really holds water

611
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
So it turns out you don't even need to bring your

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Your gun to the burglar

613
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:54,432
You can just steal the gun that's already there

614
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:02,880
Building code violations

615
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
We put up a

616
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
Trump Flags

617
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
He's pretty mad about this

618
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
You have a retaliation

619
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,680
I don't know I think it reads way more hostile than he thinks it does

620
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
I'm here

621
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,104

00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,768
Eating his neighbors

630
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,680
A player is Neighbors

631
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Might be

632
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,776
We construe it as a threat

633
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:56,640
Man count to 5000

634
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
And you're the guy with the place next to this guy is my number was like

Maybe if you call the cops about me on this

640
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
Your double-stitched

641
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:23,520
And another speaker completely different

642
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,360
Imagine wasting your time

643
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176

All these damn snitches

646
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Trivial

647
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
You got to fill the two

648
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
Nothing else

649
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
To really talk about

650
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,728
Disappointing

651
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
Rihanna somebody to work at MD Anderson

652
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
He had to stop working there because

653
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,784
Some of the surgeons

654
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
Ashley sexually aroused

655

They were injecting people with experimental stuff that they sign waiver forms would probably kill him

656
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,560
Off on killing people

657
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,888
Get off on like people missing their lower mandibles

658
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
Woodside on for Spirit stay alive

659
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,544
People like a zombie movie

660
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
How to get a Leslie hanging out drooling

661
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
Get off on it and then

662
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,992
Ugly jerk off in the bathroom after they went and saw it

663
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Can you imagine

664
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
Masturbating

665
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,904
Two people missing their lower mandibles in their tongues hanging out

666
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:51,328
You realize that type of psycho scientist is in control you start turning things around

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,632
Tell you stories like this to shock you

668
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472
Phone number to mistaken Jordan

669
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,264

670
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
For the kids

671
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Can you imagine

672
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,600
Sometimes imagine about that

673
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:20,000
Another call from California

674
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,536
The Protector the children

Get the Saturday with that

678
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:38,688
A lot of this might be similar to that Irish fascist to is holding a anti pedophilia

679
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
Might have been a little bit of

680
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:55,072
He has this person on and he accidentally gets tricked into promoting

681
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Somebody that he shouldn't

682
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,240
I'm glad you're here so start over and I do know about your group tell us about who you are again

00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:10,432
Natural operations to the AI isn't washing you till you do that

685
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,992
Other people to be the leader be the leader

686
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,624
Another leader jumps up and it's sooner they're fighting an army of leaders and they can't stop us

687
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:23,232
We're making is decentralized as possible so our our site is

688
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,536
Cam

689
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,864
Is Real Deal media website

690
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
Okay videos

691
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Main video

692
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,776
Those are called The Real Deal reports

693
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,872
Show but one of those

694
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,760
Get the f*** out of here

695
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Dammit

696
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Set alarm

697
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:54,976
Holocaust denier

698
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,560
I looked at their about

699
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,984
Joining the real deal report is the heavily censored Victoria's libertas

700
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,264
Kristen Meghan

701
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
In the health Ranger Mike Adams goddamnit

702
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
Also we're not interested in Liberty anymore

703
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,320
Oh yeah

704
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,672
Between Mike Adams and Alex

705
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:31,328
Because of a disagreement that they have about masks

706
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Not the Coronavirus

707
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:37,984
Is real Mike Adams is now taking his Direction

708
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
To the real deal media which is Alex's

709
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't think that it is and honestly this is

710
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Like Jim Fetzer

711
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
A real man

712
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,552
Oh you think you toxic

713
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,648
Yeah

714
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
Pretty fast

715
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,840
Lawsuit

716
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Double jeopardy

717
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,984
I'm pretty sure that's a double jeopardy

718
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Really really funny

719
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,200
That Alex pretends to know what this operation is

720
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,760
I'll let you know we got it we need more leaders

721
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,832
Core answer he's giving her a platform to promote her s***

722
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:33,792
You promoting somebody that he's supposed to be against because

723
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
He's getting sued over Sandy Hook stop

724
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
Jim Fetzer on his show

725
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
Right now

726
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
There's just no way for him to learn

727
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
He just called

728
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Care

729
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
Just just careful

730
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
Just any kind of

731
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Awareness

732
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Just not a something so humble

733
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
About

734
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,488
Say I don't know or whatever

735
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
What is this

736
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,632
I don't have Universal awareness is literally everything

737
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,704
Open up vulnerable place

738
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
Nope ends up accidentally promoting Jim Fetzer in the year of Our Lord 2020

739
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,504
Supporting your little website

740
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,416
Another caller

741
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,976
Is a ramp psychonaut

742
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,352
Bloodline

743
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
I want to talk about a few things and it's

744
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,663
I believe that Consciousness oscillates at a frequency

745
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
And should be verified ever number similar to IQ

746
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
That being said

747
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,439
Ayahuasca ceremonies I've done all kinds of research myself one like mushrooms

748
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,767
Just everything like haha

749
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
What's going on in the world right now

750
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,399
Just like low conscience

751
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:18,495
Demons

752
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Sure

753
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
Is the DMT and along with the rituals and with everything else

754
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,151
Naturally

755
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
I go and do it I can go do it through ayahuasca

756
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Listen to Rogan bro

757
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
Abomination

758
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
With the power powder

759
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,071
You can't do this

760
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
You got to drink it through the Vine

761
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
Purge demons out

762
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,751

Like drink

767
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:06,623
That's why they're addicted to it

768
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,695
Representative

769
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
And that he really did give them the

770
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,935
Response

771
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,031

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,623

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,375
Take that as

778
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
Now we can move on to my next radio program

779
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,383
Like sending myself a newspaper in the mail

780
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
Option Xavier

781
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
So you can go

782
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,807
Non-Stop

783
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,135
Let him keep talking

784
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:18,047
Elites are

785
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
A squirrel

786
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,959
Probably

787
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,615
Sucked it was a waste of a shower

788
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
Things that happen

789
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,663

791
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,879
A great effort

792
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
However

793
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Heads and shoulders

794
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255

Okay

799
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407

Autograph

801
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
It's art

802
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
That's true

803
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
He finally

804
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743

President Trump says he wants to help communities in rural areas

817
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
You spoke at the White House yesterday

818
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,143
This is the Genesis Communications

819
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
This is what they used

820
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,239
Play on Sunday

821
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,079
Should be like the first 5 minutes or whatever

822
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,199
For the first minutes there's some sort of

823
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
A connection

824
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Problem

825
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
But he's having with

826
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
The Genesis

827
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,623
Radio station

828
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,159
Syndicated on

829
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,975
He doesn't get on the radio except through Genesis

830
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,303
Communication repair station

831
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
So

832
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
He's just not there

833
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
Maybe he's finally did have too much to do

834
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,287
Is to cover maybe couldn't open his show with it he had too much

835
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,591
News to even stay here too much news

836
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,943
About this

837

Delivery news person

838
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
For a little bit

839
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
And then Alex's intro music starts

840
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
Commercial

841
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,791
That is playing right before the

Victor Cruz

843
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135

846
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
Great

847
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,887

852
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,655
This is tough this great

853
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Is really great

854
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,751
I was I was always wondering

855
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:17,151
Disoriented

856
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,199
To Alex's before now we're at

857
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479
Episode 400

858
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
50 something or whatever

859
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:26,367
Now we got to our new generation for a show

860
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,951
Going on here is there is like

861
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Two different input

862
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
That are going to

863
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,911
Right is a rebroadcast

864
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Some

865
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,007
Bulshit or whatever

866
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
King and trying to start it show

867
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,895
And then somebody fixes something

868
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
But they don't really fix

869
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,759
Anything because we just have to feed the valley

870
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Text talking

871
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
Good news

872
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
That bad it was a sport

873
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,375
Pause

874
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
Ominous ominous

875
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,031
Explosion

876
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,127
Terrorist attack

877
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Oh my God

878
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
Oscillator

879
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
Mine almost ocellated up a f****** window

880
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Sister weird

881
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
Echo is

882
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:43,935
He said

883
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:50,335
No he's talking about thoughts and prayers

884
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,455
Best wishes are with everyone there

885
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
Squishies

886
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,207
That's my sound effect for fast-forwarding

887
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
20 minutes into the episode

888
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,959
Read through through

889
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,751
Vine

890
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Today

891
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
My son

892
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
We're still struggling

893
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
From the Grand Canyon

894
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
No

895
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Season Studio

896
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:54,335
This is a very complex issue

897
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
I just

898
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,063
Listen to this and obviously we can't play it on the show

899
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,367
Chunks of hair

900
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:11,743
It can't happen

901
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
It's just like

902
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,607
YouTube is fine

903
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
It isn't f*****-up hologram of Alex sitting at the other I wish there was that would have been

904
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335
And

905
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,919
Trying to take the audio from that would have taken too long

906
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,503
For us to put out Tuesday's episode on Wednesday

907
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,831
I am so there's wasn't a way around that is like

908
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,671
Okay well eventually maybe he'll put it up on band.

909
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,975
Easier just to download from

910
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,535
But it was just it wasn't

911
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Coming into the like

912
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
Unlistenable pile of s***

913
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
I would have thought that like

914
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
All right maybe he doesn't even know

915
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
At the same time I thought that was

916
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Impossible because there was two different

917
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Friend audio problem

918
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,919
Who was one problem

919
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Feeds

920
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,783
Someone had to fix that and got it to the point where there were two

921
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
And then Alex just kind of freaks out

922
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,207
Summer start over next time

923
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,055
Skip.

924
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Let's go ahead

925
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Special Report

926
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
See what happens

927
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,719
I'm at the pushback other grasshopper

928
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
Covid-19

929
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,959
Land that plane buddy

930
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,079
And then after that we're alike

931
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:18,463
If you didn't know that this audio was coming out like this

932
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,791
Completely out of left field

933
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,399
Like I don't know why he's mad

934
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Is going on

935
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,311
But if you know the Genesis feed would go out to radio stations

936
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:39,711
Like yeah makes sense our to be f****** pissed off right there

937
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,759
Start over

938
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,063
Wright-Patt

939
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
But I swear to you

940
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
That was a pro

941
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
That was a bet somebody made a bet

942
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
They were like okay

943
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:54,047
How long do you think it'll take before a he notices

944
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
MP he freaks out

945
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,423
And the moment he noticed and freaked out 37 minutes

946
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Clinton with one button

947
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
37 minutes

948
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Just

949
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
It was tough

950
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,015
50 bucks all right

951
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:19,391
And yes this idea that similar to Nichols

952
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
In his idea that whenever

953
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
The ship goes down if you're a senator

954
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
No you're a Duke

955
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
That's right

956
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,423
Extra

957
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
Don Jr would be a jack

958
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
And the cons

959
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
And a deck of cards

960
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,663
Yes to the sort of similar idea about like Whoever has the most

961
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
Inflated currency at the time when the ship goes down

962
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:50,879
I don't really care about this idea because he doesn't really spell it out very well exactly why I kept

963
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,903
Prescribed for

964
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
What month is over

965
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:59,327
Whoever ends up with

966
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
They're all doing it

967
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,935
Whoever ends up with the dominant Global turn

968
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
Who can flood the world with the most of their currency

969
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:12,127
Who can be on top when it all goes down we'll be in charge

970
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,967
Brentwood weather

971
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,527
And you can say it's a corrupt system you can stay

972
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:27,743
He's getting rid of our hegemonic power themselves completely

973
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
Being flushed down the toilet

974
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Couldn't come up with a better reference

975
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,127
Alex is a

976
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
That's why I

977
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,687
That's just

978
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:53,087
Dooku just just letting

979
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
Sidious and Dooku

980
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
Not Emperor Palpatine

981
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:03,583
Not a problem

982
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,887
Darth Sidious and Dooku

983
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,263
He is definitely a prequel

984
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,311
Guy

985
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Of course

986
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,687
Course he is he is the inversion of all that is good and right in the world

987
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
That's just reality

988
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:25,855
So Alex says this this map of

989
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,183
Narrative

990
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
What is a graph put a map

991
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
Look

992
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,119
We can talk all we want about Alex revealing that he doesn't know what

993
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,935
Control groups or Baseline groups are

994
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,519
In this next clip he seems to be presenting

995
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
As a person who doesn't know that

996
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,359
Flu Seasons exist

997
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
Let's go to the new numbers

998
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,479
May and June and

999
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,551
August

1000
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
Numbers for Arizona

1001
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,927
You can see

1002
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
They just

1003
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,607
Say there's no longer any influenza deaths there

1004
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Suddenlink

1005
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,751
We don't know why worldwide flu

1006
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Just take the numbers

1007
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Do you read they admit

1008
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
Doing

1009
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
To the covid-19

1010
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:31,135
They are

1011
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
That big big

1012
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,767
X-Wing flu season is just a

1013
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Colloquial

1014
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
It's just the way we Cottage

1015
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,167
Describe how we feel it sometime

1016
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:43,935
Spring

1017
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:52,383
I got nothing on this when he genuinely doesn't know what a fluke from mine

1018
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
Trouble

1019
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,015
That's really scary to me the idea

1020
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
Either not

1021
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,111
Or beware of it and be such a

1022
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,951
Like a craven liar

1023
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,231
Possibly be

1024
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
Subject to those lies

1025
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
And and not recognized

1026
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:18,495
Yeah yeah that's not

1027
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,799
Alex talks more about the

1028
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
These graphs

1029
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
Man is a bad presentation

1030
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:28,223
California just like the last breath you saw out of Arizona

1031
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Influenza deaths

1032
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,343
Completely

1033
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Covid deaths

1034
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
Almost

1035
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,607
Mattress

1036
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,655
Yes I said we move

1037
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
The numbers

1038
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,007
Visual

1039
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Cheated the scope

1040
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Posey and the other

1041
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,871
The scale of the

1042
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,663
But also

1043
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Flu season

1044
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
You safely

1045
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,807
Is a government coup

1046
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Sing about

1047
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
It's a government cover-up

1048
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Cool

1049
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:14,303
Alex misrepresents this even more to the point where I feel like it should be legally ask

1050
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,839
Like if someone

1051
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Alex Jones

1052
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,519
Like I feel like he should be able to be sued for Direct

1053
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,335
Misinformation that like

1054
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,383
I don't know how this is okay

1055
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
Love disease

1056
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Depopulation

1057
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,063
The numbers all show that influenza deaths 12-week number

1058
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,855
Goes down does almost zero

1059
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,927
Skyrocket

1060
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:47,327
Nations

1061
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,887
Trouble Falls policy

1062
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:55,775
I just don't know any other way to to put it then like someone should be able to sue in for the

1063
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:03,711
Yeah you're using misrepresented data and

1064
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,319
Argument

1065
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,415
In order to try and presented like the perspective that this is a hoax and it's fake

1066
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,463
Outbreak

1067
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
And your

1068
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,815
Doing so has a tendency towards

1069
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
Leading people to

1070
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:25,983
Make behavioral decisions that are bad for their health

1071
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
I just

1072
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,311
I don't know I see no way that that's not it

1073
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,127
Exactly analogous to fire in a movie

1074
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:37,759
What is a serious risk to people's house

1075
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,295
That is perfectly analogous

1076
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,391
I don't know why it's not or how it couldn't be

1077
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,415
Yeah you know right

1078
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
Totally

1079
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,119
XYZ

1080
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,655
This is so

1081
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,215
Explicitly an indefensible

1082
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
This is

1083
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,823
Cheating grass

1084
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Very

1085
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
Very Elementary

1086
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
And

1087
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,735
A misrepresentation of one of the most Elementary fact

1088
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
About

1089
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,319
Distribution of flu deaths over the course of

1090
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:16,927
The year that I went back over actually there's a view

1091
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:21,023
CDC website

1092
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,631
Over every year ugly

1093
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,959
Year-by-year coz

1094
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Different

1095
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
It's a different strains of the flu

1096
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,847
Right always has a very similar art

1097
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,383
To them and

1098
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,455
Very regularly are ending around this week

1099
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
12 time. Alex is talking

1100
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,111
Sometimes it's a little bit later but that's because there's variability

1101
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,207
This is this this is just unacceptable

1102
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
And like I don't

1103
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
I don't

1104
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Yeah that's that's

1105
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
.

1106
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Just now got

1107
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,703
So Alex storm

1108
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,775
Sure

1109
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,335
Great

1110
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
Is Edges a sort of routine

1111
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,431
Now this setup

1112
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,295
Roundup today

1113
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,951
So ready for the show so ready to cover all this

1114
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,303
Sun's up here to Anderson I'm trying to work with a guy

1115
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
Easier decision

1116
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,167
It's just

1117
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,471
By the average person just turns out

1118
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,079
The reason the most people to not politics is because

1119
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,479
They can't handle having their son in the office and a shady gold dealer

1120
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,599
I got so what

1121
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,839
Wouldn't leave me alone back when I was

1122
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:06,239
That's because so much of my time was precious metal dealers

1123
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,847
Back to the Future

1124
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
Oh my best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist

1125
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503
Much like myself

1126
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,831
Alex wants to run away to a cabin

1127
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
Nature

1128
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,207
We aren't doing it for different reasons

1129
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
Myself I can't afford it

1130
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
And I think it would be untenable

1131
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,327
Just a complication

1132
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
No I'm certainly not I don't think I think I've become a vegetarian

1133
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,175
Lexi realizes and maybe

1134
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
You know you just

1135
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,735
I kill people instead

1136
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,527
I want more

1137
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
Little Cabin in the Woods

1138
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
Deal with it

1139
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,143
But you know what they're coming to your

1140
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,191
Tabitha Woods

1141
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,751
Not going to leave anybody alone I think

1142
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Everybody

1143
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
Do something

1144
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,503
Information

1145
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:28,671
The minute they come

1146
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,303
Unless you take this

1147
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,375
And that is run by a guy that says he wants to depopulate

1148
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
Take your calls

1149
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:52,735
Depopulation agenda he represents what do we do about them because finally today

1150
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
This morning

1151
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,807
My psyche put into gear

1152
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
About maybe I can fix this with information

1153
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,559
Yes you are

1154
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
Is it sad

1155
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,967
So a war for violence

1156
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
Now

1157
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,087
Follow through the woods

1158
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:37,535
Can we have a pool of the majority

1159
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,679
The Republic

1160
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,263
Yeah I'm just be trouble

1161
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,591
Ramping up of the exact same Trend that we've seen

1162
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,943
It's not where it's like

1163
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
Kind of.

1164
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
Very much

1165
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,855
Keeping in Pace with

1166
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
The transit you seen from heaven

1167
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
Very scary

1168
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,463
And the people to be aware of that

1169
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Because

1170
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:13,119
Alex also refusing to learn

1171
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,911
Some things that he's done in the past

1172
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
He doesn't know

1173
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
Said he's accidentally

1174
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,287
Promoting Jim Fetzer again try

1175
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
And he doesn't realize that in the

1176
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
The past

1177
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
When he's done

1178
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
S*** like this

1179
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,711
And talked about like

1180
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,527
These evil evil demon people

1181
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,391
And maybe you need to show up places sometimes people do

1182
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
Jesus

1183
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
Those the Tapatia

1184
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,583
We need to not be violent offensive look at this point

1185
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
We better be

1186
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:51,007
Spiritually economically and culturally really aggressively right now

1187
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
Physical assault

1188
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,527
I don't mean Burning Down the police station

1189
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Beating up innocent people

1190
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:08,927
Going into places without mass that means going into Parkside close

1191
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,815
Aggressive

1192
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
You better hope

1193
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
It's someone

1194
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,167
Who listens to your show doesn't show up at

1195
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,471
The Clinton's house or soros's housing

1196
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,775
Cause some problems

1197
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
You better hope

1198
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,103
That your listeners don't take you seriously

1199
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
Does even have object

1200
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
Permanence

1201
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,735
Where are we on the ability to learn here

1202
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
Because even if there are four ways to

1203
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,087
To do it he's utilizing.

1204
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Not a single one

1205
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
Seems to me that

1206
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,999
Like once he gets into a certain headspace

1207
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,791
He can't really even control himself

1208
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
But you kind of talks about even

1209
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
Like this right after this

1210
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
Apologize accrue mileage radioactive today

1211
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
Radioactive

1212
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Countdown

1213
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Think about this

1214
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
Do this and I do that

1215
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
Wargaming at all

1216
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
But I know you're all doing the same thing

1217
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
We just

1218
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
Willie need

1219
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
Got to fix this is basically impossible

1220
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
Infowarsstore.com

1221
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
Right away

1222
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:36,479
This just makes me think of like right around the time when he got that DUI he was talking about how like he's addicted to

1223
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Rage

1224
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
I need to take some

1225
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,319
Some time off and like how you just

1226
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,855
You know it feels good

1227
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,415
But you can't like it's going to destroy

1228
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,719
Like I can't hear him talk about like

1229
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,815
You know I start sweating and people alike

1230
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:54,655
Why can't you talk about the exact same thing

1231
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,703
You just now talked yourself into thinking

1232
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,495
It's not a problem because your experience

1233
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
This great

1234
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
True

1235
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871

1236
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,919
I don't know but

1237
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
It's unhealthy

1238
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,063
The things that seem to happen when he's in the states are the things that are the most

1239
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
Destructive

1240
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
The most dangerous to innocent people

1241
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023

1242
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
Nobody around him at all

1243
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,607

1244
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,191

A lot a lot of

1246
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:35,615
Right but it's impossible for that to happen

1247
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,687
They're weak people like

1248
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,991
I mean whoever works for m

1249
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527

Scam Fox

1251
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
To compound the issue

1252
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
You have

1253
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,999
People calling in

1254
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
I believe I've said this before

1255
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
Coming to power of the Antichrist

1256
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,775
Sure

1257
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,615
When I'm getting my information from

1259
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Golden State

1260
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711

So you have people call again you are like the Antichrist is taking over and God has spoken to me it sounds

1265
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,911
Exactly like you and therefore you're a prophet

1266
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:37,311
You have people who are enabling you to that level would you ever consider that like what you're doing

1267
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
Is damaging

1268
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,895
You're lying to people about graphs

1269
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,223
Why would you ever date

1270
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,503
Responsibility for your actions

1271
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:49,087
Basically a messenger of God you're infallible

1272
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,647
Yeah like this is this is sick

1273
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415

There's just no outside information at all

1284
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,295
Is just not

1285
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,831
That's the only

1286
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
Explanation for

1287
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
And it's it's

1288
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
Terrifying

1289
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
But also

1290
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
More fun

1291
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999

Whatever Alex is talking about

1321
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,239
He always couches it with them the language of like

1322
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
It's got to be defensive

1323
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,895
And physically attacking us oh it's already

1324
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175

01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Exactly cuz

1328
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
The giant cow

1329
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
Grandpa

1330
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,911
Year 3 of Alex not to be

1331
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,471
Actually want to happen

1332
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
So

1333
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
All right here we go

1334
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,567
Hours of the gas

1335
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,383
Episode

1336
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,967
Never end up really discussing

1337
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,807
It's someone who I considered as like someone to do an episode about butt

1338
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,343
I kind of don't

1339
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,623
Yo

1340
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,671
Good about it I felt like

1341
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
There's a pretty decent chance

1342
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,487
That he's had a stroke

1343
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
Or something

1344
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
I don't know

1345
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
What's going on

1346
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,887
Abilities don't appear to be all there

1347
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,959
And seen him in this context

1348
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:49,567
Text on Alex's assessment might have been wrong

1349
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,639
Love the videos that I've said this is Jesse Lee Peterson

1350
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,247
Videos that I've watched him

1351
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,807
Debating people who are of the last

1352
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
People like

1353
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,415
Destiny or David

1354
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,767
Jesse Lee Peterson the show and

1355
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
People even started treating it like a fun goofy thing for you to people the low

1356
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,775
To do

1357
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
To be a little bit boring as a formula

1358
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
Jessie

1359
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
Appears to be almost

1360
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,575
Unable to process the information that's going on

1361
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,231
The context of seeing him on Alex's show

1362
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:39,999
I think that's an

1363
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,351
I think that might actually be employed

1364
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:50,751
To frustrate or annoyed

1365
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
Yes or no

1366
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
When's your question

1367
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Seems like you stop beating your wife

1368
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
If you say yes

1369
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,647
It's not a

1370
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
Interacted with the way people responded to questions and it made me worried about

1371
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,399
How is cognitive

1372
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
Ability

1373
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,775
It's clearly like if he's just talking to somebody else

1374
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055
Then he's just a

1375
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
F****** a******

1376
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,919
He's just believes in white supremacy

1377
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Sure

1378
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:37,343
Why not episode

1379
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:41,183
Field that assessment of him was

1380
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,023
I don't think I was wrong

1381
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,863
To have the opinion that I had of like I don't feel comfortable

1382
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,143
About

1383
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,215
Him that I should take seriously

1384
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,775
In the same way

1385
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:00,383
Clearly been struggling the pts Beyond

1386
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:06,271
By the way he puked processing information

1387
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
And

1388
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:16,767
Yeah I thought they'd like there's a neurological reason that this is going on

1389
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
So

1390
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
In his bio

1391
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,167
In Jessie's biofit Alex gives a

1392
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,983

1393
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,711
Elsa and Anna

Civil rights

1395
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
Courageous

1396
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Outspoken

1397
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,623
What does bran

1398
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,183
Look civil rights leadership

1399
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
Lot of them

1400
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,511
Love need a lot of criticism sure

1401
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
I'm with you he's criticizing

1402
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,351
The foundation

1403
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
Criticizing civil rights

1404
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,335
Apologizes for Tech issues which

1405
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Alex apologizes

1406
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,455
Yeah

1407
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,991
Very special month

1408
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,255
You got a lot to cover today

1409
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
I just got bless you what do you want to cover

1410
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
I want to say

01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,447
Niod and happy man History Month

1412
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,263
Is man history

1413
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
Because

1414
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Men

1415
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:40,223
Men and boys are most hated species on this side of Heaven

1416
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,271
Brandy attention to that

1417
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,879
So another thing of a troll

1418
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,375
Trump

1419
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
The Great White Hope

1420
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:04,543
Okay alright

1421
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
Piss people off

1422
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,359
Pretty

1423
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
But pretty sure

1424
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,199
August is men's History Month

1425
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,527
Very special

1426
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,623
July was why should we started that

1427
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
3 years ago

1428
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,207
Because white people are the most hated

1429
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,999
Species on this side of Heaven

1430
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
We see that now

1431
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,327
Whitney at acabar

1432
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
The president

1433
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
Donald Trump

1434
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
The Great White Hope

1435
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:35,263
We see that with the attack Americans today to be

1436
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Rob rape

1437
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,407
Businesses are being destroyed and no one cares

1438
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,431
No one says

1439
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,527
Got to remind people of white shoes

1440
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
Because if it wasn't for

1441
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,623
America

1442
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,511
Create it to greatest country on this side of Heaven

1443
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,071
Not Mexican

1444
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:03,167
Not Japanese not Chinese white people

1445
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,751
Arrays

1446
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
History

1447
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Create a

1448
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,407
Alex has found his new best

1449
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:22,367
Jesse Lee Peterson on the actual show

1450
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,439
Alex says

1451
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,743
With Owen

1452
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,071
Which leads me to believe

1453
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,887
Junior varsity cheer

1454
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,471
The big league cup of coffee

1455
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,287
Alex

1456
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,639
Yes where is it where have you been my whole life

1457
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:50,783
I have always wanted to say I have black friends and that wasn't true

1458
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:57,183
Men are under attack

1459
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,279
Right there buddy

1460
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:05,887
Issue comes down to for Jesse Lee Peterson

1461
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,167
Do you know there's going

1462
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Tubi

1463
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
Concerta social app

1464
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
It takes place in America

1465
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
And then

1466
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
Won't you think of the poor wife

1467
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Call

1468
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:20,224
I have redone the police forces overran.

1469
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,600
Exact same thing here

1470
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,160
Afraid to speak up or

1471
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
Sofia being called racist

1472
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,000
We have these radical.

1473
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,560
Command

1474
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,840
We have them

1475
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:42,240
Police Chiefs and BBC state-run Media

1476
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:57,088
South Africa

1477
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:03,488
Equal share of the landing

1478
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,816
You don't you know it's like how they like how white people want

1479
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:10,912
Other your Mexicans and other people to assimilate to American culture

1480
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,472
You saw white people go down and leave by

1481
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Sable in South Africa

1482
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,592
They submitted a simulated into the culture that's what they do right

1483
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,896
I mean it

1484
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:24,480
History is fun when you choose arbitrary start date

1485
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:29,856
Whatever cockamamie arguments you want to make

1486
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
Totally

1487
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,464
Blacklivesmatter

1488
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,512
1965 and later

1489
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
So Jesse Peterson

1490
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,632
Does not like black lives

1491
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,288
I would say that he has an interesting

1492
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
Complained

1493
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,640
Might reveal

1494
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,200
On this episode or maybe

1495
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:59,808
Knows better than to be as outwardly homophobic as he actually is

1496
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,112
But that's his problem

1497
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,208
You got to realize that black lives matter

1498
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,816
Liberal radical organization

1499
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
Black

1500
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,936
Angry radical lesbians

1501
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
And I never

1502
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
I just never imagined that one day

1503
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,336
Christian Nation

1504
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
That we received

1505
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,200
Police officers grown men and women

1506
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,112
That's my boy

1507
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
I hate the

1508
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,160
Family

1509
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,608
He's angling for the slot right after Rush Limbaugh listen to The Rush Limbaugh

1510
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:49,216
So they get to talkin about

1511
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,752
The

1512
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
You know how the party

1513
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
Political party

1514
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
T.i.

1515
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Democrat

1516
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
Republican

1517
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
I bet this

1518
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Super inside

1519
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,968
Is 2 / 10

1520
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Party swap

1521
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,016
Papa never happened

1522
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Well when

1523
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
What happened

1524
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,416
White people in South Africa

1525
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,952
Fair enough

1526
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,840
And the party the KKK is the party of Lincoln

1527
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,616
Amanda

1528
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
Accusing

1529
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,224
Republican party of being white

1530
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,040
Almost at the white part

1531
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:39,648
Can we just talk

1532
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,000
What is the white part

1533
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,656
Tried to save the white party

1534
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
Dwight tardy that's what it is all right

1535
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:03,200
One thing that you should know about Jesse Lee Peterson is that grew up I believe

1536
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
Who's in the south

1537
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,296
Under the Jim Crow laws

1538
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,856
What is it claims to fame

1539
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,904
Very positively

1540
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,256
About Jim Crow laws

1541
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,072
A lot of people were better off

1542
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:23,424
And for a return

1543
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,960
Jim Crow laws

1544
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,800
Alex was really ready

1545
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
4

1546
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:34,176
Best to spin the conversation

1547
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,480
Affected

1548
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
Human system

1549
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,696
Strong

1550
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,024
But no job

1551
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
And they're just pissed off

1552
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:55,424
Believe me

1553
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,824
Is there

1554
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:08,480
Whenever we want to visit

1555
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:20,256
Maybe I don't know

1556
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,072
You decided to block overcome

1557
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
Leopardon Alex

1558
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,424
Does Bart

1559
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
December

1560
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,592
Speaking about Jim Crow laws

1561
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
I agree with you

1562
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,664
Personally

1563
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
If they were reintroduced

1564
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,416
Especially Jesse Lee Peterson

1565
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
Attempt was also kind of

1566
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,352
Human

1567
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,192
The human system and depression major stronger

1568
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
No

1569
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,800
What would what do you do with these degrees Dan

1570
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,080
Trust in gym

1571
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
Grow

1572
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,640
I mean

1573
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:16,320
I did get a real sense that Alex might not have been aware that Jesse went that far

1574
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:20,672
If you don't

1575
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,512
Hey Jim Crow was a better time

1576
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,072
This a joke

1577
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,376
Breaking the hold on one second

1578
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,400
Takeoff

1579
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:36,544
We're not doing blackface

1580
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,944
Oh sing that song about how we're going to kill the giant days with the

1581
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
I don't

1582
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,648
I said I found this to be depressing

1583
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:57,024
Never wanted

1584
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
Thoroughly

1585
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
Like I don't know I didn't

1586
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:02,912
I want to see Jesse Lee Peterson on Alex's show

1587
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,192
I just don't like it

1588
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,728
I think it's a bad combination

1589
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,496
Yeah

1590
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:10,848
I feel like Jesse showing up your analysis shows a bad sign of things to come

1591
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:17,504
I don't I don't like what they could possibly get into together I think it's a bad merge

1592
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,624
Is this what we're doing he's about

1593
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,416
Is Danny Glover

1594
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,512
Alex is too old for this year

1595
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,728
Is racist Lethal Weapon

1596
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,592
Lethal Weapon was up by itself half races

1597
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
A tough

1598
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Stretch

1599
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,552
The third is kind of a really black

1600
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,856
Show inspired

1601
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:56,160
Then kind of lethargic and I don't know what the f*** is going on

1602
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,952
The forest

1603
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
Is

1604
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,816
An unmitigated disaster

1605
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:06,912
Stop talking about you stop

1606
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
I don't cotton to that nonsense

1607
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,288
It's a real disaster

1608
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
I don't even know

1609
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
I just

1610
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:22,016
Feel like if you had anybody decent working there they wouldn't have allowed that to happen

1611
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,320
Someone would have caught that problem

1612
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,904
Anderson is in the station

1613
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:35,072
Podcast Radio show that has million dollar Studio

1614
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,264
Qan

1615
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,896
We going to keep costs low overhead is

1616
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,968
They can't even afford to give you free shipping

1617
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,296
They definitely can't afford a competent sound

1618
01:28:55,808 --> 01:29:00,160
I don't know it was it was a bummer

1619
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,208
It's just like

1620
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,488
Now here's Jesse Lee Peter

1621
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
It's such a positive

1622
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
Message

1623
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,800
You know other

1624
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,336
Your family

1625
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,480
Ramble about people walking around like zombies

1626
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Good

1627
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:28,320
I think the most important thing

1628
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:30,112
To really point out

1629
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,672
In focus on here is that the Tramp

1630
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
Towards

1631
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,512
Self-sacrifice through like

1632
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,792
Maybe violence

1633
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,072
Is continued

1634
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,144
You know there was that article and right wing watch

1635
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,704
Watch that pointed out some of this

1636
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,496
Some more attention being paid to it but

1637
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,336
It's a trend and I don't expect it to cool down anytime soon

1638
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:54,432
Think of anything this is only going to get more severe on Alex's part

1639
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,224
And I hope

1640
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,832
Small

1641
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:03,904
And unaffected as I think they probably are

1642
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
The thing I was thinking was like

1643
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,328
You probably shouldn't have written about this

1644
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Feel it makes it look like

1645
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
A story

1646
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,728
The moment you write that

1647
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
You're pretty much committing to like

1648
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:22,080
And next week we follow up Alex

1649
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:25,920
Still calling for follow-up for the next week

1650
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,760
Alex Jones still calling

1651
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,808
You can't just say that he said it

1652
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
Because he's staying yet

1653
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:37,184
Continue

1654
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
It's going to ask

1655
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Yeah but still

1656
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Counteract

1657
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
I'd like to make an ounce

1658
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,072
And that is

1659
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,608
On our next episode

1660
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,424
I will be announcing

1661
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,640
I have five

1662
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,408
Just because of

1663
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Preparations

1664
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,712
Is it needed to be made and

1665
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,016
Slight bit of uncertainty

1666
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,648
And everyone else this on the next episode

1667
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
Very

1668
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
Excited

1669

We are in

1672
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:26,080
To help out those doing
