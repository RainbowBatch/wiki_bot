1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Alex Jones

5
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,960
What's a Jordan is a yearly ritual

6
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,056
Around this. Your holiday season

7
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Every year

8
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
Are you a nice package of Williams-Sonoma peppermint bark

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
From my aunt and uncle

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,064
It's very nice I just got that I ate it already

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Are you very fast

12
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,976
Goodall man ABC I'm using this bright spot also 22 to make up for something

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Constantly forget to like thank them

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,912
Sure until I'm banking on possibly that my mom is listening to this podcast

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Exactly

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Not texting them

17
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
But also not texting your old boss busy I like it I love it

18
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
What are you got going on

19
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Today Dan is we were guests on the wonderful god-awful movie podcast

20
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Set dropped

21
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,776
Confusing movie we have to watch

22
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,176
Yeah we watched the Universe part 0

23
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
What

24
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Fun

25
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,112
You will not stop yelling at 10

26
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
If you don't understand what that is

27
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
Those

28
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Folk were having a song

29
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
What are the light

30
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
So Jordan today

31
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
We have to do our work

32
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
And that is

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
The most important work that we have ever done in our lives

34
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
And that is

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
Checking in on what's going on with reset War

36
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
We have to

37
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
Alex is going to say that this is the most important thing he's ever done

38
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
But I'm going to treat it as such

39
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Yes

40
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
I'm so there's been some developments

41
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,792
Medcenter last time we checked in and spoiler alert it's been released

42
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Have they disappeared Into The Ether

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
I have no reports okay on that

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Alright

45
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,032
So

47
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Transcending that has going on among

48
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
What's the info Warrior community

49
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
But I don't I don't have any other.

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
I think I probably didn't happen

51
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Doubtful but

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
I have

53
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Reached an impasse

54
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Slightly

55
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,280
And we'll talk about it over the course of this episode

56
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm up against the wall

57
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
I don't know what to do

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,424
And I'm getting it I'm willing to take advice from the audience on this one

59
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
I will talk about all that before we do

60
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll take you to some new from Virginia Beach Virginia

61
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
I'm about like Wavy Gravy

62
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,856
I like it

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,488
To the team

64
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,399
Separately double Patriot points till Valentine's Day

65
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm a policy wonk thank you very much and I can't Listen to Smashing Pumpkins now and not think of the time Billy Corgan was

66
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
Gaston in pool

67
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Oh yeah

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,599
Yeah but he was saying the world is a vampire he was being literal it was it was not

69
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
Metaphor

70
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,023
Quaintly put into a cage and transformed into a rat Chimera is there an issue

71
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Despite Israel

72
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,679
So I have a couple things that I want to get out of the way better than reset Wars

73
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
Before we get going

74
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
I have

75
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
The information that's available and I

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Have looked at what

77
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,711
Been going on with reset Wars and what's been going on with Alex on his show

78
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
And I am becoming more and more convinced

79
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
That I was a little bit off

80
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,647
I don't think that Alex is running

81
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Reset Wars

82
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
At all I don't know for sure

83
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
But it does not

84
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
View attached

85
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
To his main product

86
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,655
In any way

87
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
Completely separate

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Feels like a gig

89
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Did the vibe that I get off

90
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
What's this

91
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
Is it this is a this is like a Dulce thing

92
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Tim Burton producing Nightmare Before Christmas

93
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Timber new mate

94
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
That kind of thing

95
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,183
No no it was produced by the director of Nightmare Before

96
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
No no I don't have a totally different thing

97
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Monkeybone Monkeybone that movie Monkeybone was directed by the director of Nightmare Before Christmas

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Exactly

99
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,127
I worked at the movie theater or Monkeybone came out and you will not believe how many people were so different.

100
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:14,015
Ono 30 years for the Brendan Fraser to come back after Monkeybone

101
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,855
That's how good he never came never never end

102
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
God bless him

103
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,279
He shouldn't have weight Corky Romano is that before or after monkey baby under we may never know

104
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
So yeah

105
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
It feels it feels kind of like

106
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
He's a picture man

107
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
Something I don't know I don't know for sure

108
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Like I said

109
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Help to tell butt

110
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
Everything seems very discordant

111
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
The contactor is pulling out on this

112
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Maybe

113
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
The observer effect

114
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Everything

115
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Seems to disconnect

116
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,111
Is a little correction about this

117
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
And that is that

118
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,999
On our first episode about recent Wars I talked about how Jake Ducey has a podcast

119
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
And I said that it was on iHeart

120
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
And what I meant to say

121
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,727
Calculator this incredibly poorly

122
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,871
His podcast and I didn't realize this because we're not on a network and I don't know how these things work

123
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
Reached out and made it sound like they produced that podcast

124
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
I realized that is

125
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Kind of how it came off

126
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Totally not my intention and I

127
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,231
I did not mean to imply that the company iHeartRadio

128
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
That was just poorly delivered on my part

129
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Anyway

130
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
Look here's what's going to happen

131
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Alex released

132
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Reset Wars

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
The other

134
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
Couple nights ago

135
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
From when we're recording

136
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Like a Taylor Swift

137
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,431
Talk about that a little bit but before we do we need to lead up to it

138
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
By looking at

139
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Free videos

140
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Could Alex put out

141
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Promoting

142
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Hello release of up reset Wars

143
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
The first one

144
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Is a video that you put out called

145
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,511
Transcend the third dimension with Alex Jones and reset Wars

146
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
This is a good

147
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
2 minutes long

148
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
This but these videos I'm just going to play

149
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
Just cut it points for us to discuss share not

150
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
Not leaving much on the on the Cutting Room floor

151
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
And here is where we start

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
The archive

153
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Tunnel

154
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
The portal

155
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Is amongst the most

156
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Because

157
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
We know we came out of our mother

158
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
What

159
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
We know that

160
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Portals are tunnels

161
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Symbolize

162
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Coming from one state

163
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Instinctively

164
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,191
Symbol of the

165
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Transference

166
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Destroyed

167
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
What quantum

168
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Quantum mechanics

169
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Ever done

170
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
And all available

171
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Reset War

172
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
I think Alex maybe like

173
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
It'd be so fun if you just like

174
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Heard that Alan Watts

175
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
The drunk

176
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
Actually I could ramble of nonsense over

177
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
Soft music people see the f****** love that old man I remember reading the Dallas pool imagine if it was the reset

178
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
He's mine

179
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Yeah so what's going on here is that

180
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
16 there was this picture of Alex walking out of

181
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,999
Atonal looking pretty angry

182
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,863
6:30 or 4:40.

183
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
So I

184
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
On his property

185
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Probably

186
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
I think he's leaving his driveway

187
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
The man

188
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
How great would it be though if that was

189
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
In like

190
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Some random ass place in Florida and they're like

191
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,415
God dammit

192
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
Turtle tunnel

193
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
Nearby have been occupied Texas I have never looked at a tunnel and thought

194
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
Wow

195
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
That reminds me of vagina

196
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Is it

197
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
It didn't occur to me to drive beneath the mountain and go through this is warm but that rule

198
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
I want to go through it

199
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
Cuz it's like a womb

200
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
Yes yes strange don't know what it means to say that the tunnel is one of the most

201
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Tibial images

202
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Cuz I

203
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
I think

204
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
You could come up with a lot

205
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Of different

206
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Archetypal images

207
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Sure

208
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
I don't know I don't know how you rank them

209
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,495
But I guess tunnel is up there archetypal image

210
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,335
Also the idea that the energy can't be destroyed or created only change

211
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Hello that's quantum

212
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Mechanics that's just

213
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
The first law of thermodynamics

214
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
It's just how it works

215
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
I don't

216
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Noah

217
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
He's trying to say

218
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
We are but it's

219
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Confusing me

220
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
End of the social ears Engineers understanding the first law of thermodynamics is wonderful

221
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Straight I appreciate that

222
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
I'm confused as to how they can orca

223
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:23,519
Castrate movements based around that most scientists

224
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
I think that like

225
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Quantum mechanics

226
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,015
And so probably be understanding of it relies on

227
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
Stuff that was built out of the understanding of

228
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
The more basic for the

229
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
Sure I mean

230
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
To my ears

231
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,815
I am getting the vibe of people who have just

232
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Like

233
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Taking the pseudoscience

234
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
The four

235
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Humor's and just changed it with quantum mechanics you know like

236
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,591
Well if your bile is out of alignment then you're in trouble or just like

237
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
If your color about

238
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Quantum mechanics is out of

239
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Whack then you're in trouble like that gun

240
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,575
I feel like generally speaking it's just kind of like

241
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Bluffing depth

242
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
And this is big comes across in this next Passage

243
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
I hope you'll join me

244
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Secret

245
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Howard

246
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Incredible level

247
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
A lot of

248
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Others in the dark

249
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
We are literally talking

250
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Spirit Wars mine

251
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
Just a word to the wise

252
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Don't fall for it when people act like this

253
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Do that

254
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
When there's some kind of a nut

255
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:59,263
Unspoken piece of information that is transformed and empowered someone's life but also

256
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
A lot of people have found out about another using it for evil but I'm not going

257
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Talk about what it is or

258
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Don't believe

259
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
No it's not

260
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,807
Amir just stop believing hard enough

261
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
I believe it real hard

262
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
This reminds me so much here's the problem that I'm having right now haha one of my favorite gods

263
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
How to beat You black Emperor songs

264
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
Is essentially a tunnel is a metaphor

265
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,079
It's like an eight-minute song I can't remember if it's bbf3 or Moira or something like that

266
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
But it is this

267
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Lunatic poet

268
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
Who's just come out of getting a f****** Park

269
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
King tickets

270
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
And going off

271
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,391
Sovereign citizenship all put to godspeed You black Emperor music

272
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,743
And it's really really good and Atmospheric and it sounds suspiciously like this

273
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
But this is way worse

274
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Gatsby doesn't involve

275
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
If godspeed and Alex Jones had Italian

276
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,519
I might be f***** I might have no idea where the land but morally

277
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,895
Alex hear that

278
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
On way to inoculate yourself from me

279
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
But here here is the here's the end of this video if this is

280
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Pretty funny

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,159
You'll notice a change in audio a little bit

282
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
And yet you build be pretty

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Please do figure out what's going on

284
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Find out more and start your journey today

285
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Reset Warriors

286
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
You don't have to stay with him

287
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
You don't have to

288
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
Free will

289
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Eternity

290
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,423
So that was Alex yelling from the other side of the tunnel

291
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
Will Echo

292
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Hello

293
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
He's yelling from across the tunnel short

294
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
Amazing come with us just beautiful

295
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,623
That was disappointing

296
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Anyting

297
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,719
I have no idea what the hell does reset Wars about

298
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Vaguely spiritual

299
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
Vaguely based on like hypothetical quantum

300
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,911
Mechanics sure it's something to do with transcending the third dimension

301
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Also it seems a little creepier

302
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Then

303
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,639
Very creepy

304
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
The end of a tunnel a big like come with us

305
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Butts

306
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
Yeah that's upsetting

307
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,279
Satisfying but luckily Alex released another video about Risa or plugging the eventual launch

308
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Postpone the number of Thai

309
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
The second one was titled

310
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,495
The Earth and reset wars.com

311
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,919
Starting the video up I just I have to guess that it's going to be pretty grandiose considering the recent wars being put up there with a pan

312
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
A lot of important things like God and the Earth

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:26,367
This is the least viewed preview for recent Wars and it starts with Alex talking to a camera

314
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
In a wooded area

315
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
That I'm going to gases backyard

316
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
F****** around with here here's where we're at on

317
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Tune in to God

318
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
The Earth and reset wards.com

319
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,543
Grandiose

320
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
How do you say

321
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Pink butterflies

322
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Enable 2fa

323
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Gallstones

324
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Parents were born

325
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Naproxen

326
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
It's electric

327
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Cell

328
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
That actually navigate

329
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Layla onto the Earth

330
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Ley lines

331
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Connecticut

332
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
To lower animals

333
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Aldi's

334
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Trees

335
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Everything

336
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Conduit

337
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Football

338
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
Swinging

339
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,879
I would say I'd already Alex's way off on a bunch of stuff

340
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
The question of how birds know how and when to buy great is really interesting.

341
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Crazy field-of-study

342
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
The mechanisms that are involved for Birds aren't the same as what's going on with like butterflies but I guess they're both situations

343
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:50,591
Involve migrations cool call it all the same thing he's implying that

344
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,967
Decent hummingbirds and butterflies migrate to the same place they were their parents were born in order to mate and lay eggs

345
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
And that's not true

346
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:04,159
What I was actually referring to the phenomenon called natal homing which is weird

347
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Go to reproduce

348
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,767
This is not like messerli prevalent in geese or hummingbirds

349
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,119
Probably meant to use where salmon and turtles

350
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
Which are better examples

351
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
This is like really

352
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:22,847
Crazy stuff to be far beyond my ability to explain to sync lie here but there are few things that I need to point out

353
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,735
This has nothing to do with ley-lines which aren't even real

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
It does involve magnetic fields and the ability that animals like turtles and salmon as well as pigeons have called magnetic

355
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
No reception

356
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,487
The exact process of how this works is something the scientist heaven

357
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
I really reached a consensus on

358
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:47,935
According to an article in the Smithsonian some believe that it has to do with proteins in the retina that can detect magnetic information

359
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
While another hypothesis is that quote

360
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,103
Microscopic particles of the mineral magnetite said if certain receptor cells in the

361
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
The ear or behind the nose

362
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
And work as biological

363
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Compasses

364
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,087
It's entirely possible that some humans may also have very subtle levels of magnetic reception

365
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
But this is far from being proven in any repeatable experiment

366
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,231
Also a number scientist don't seem to have much

367
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Faith that even if humans

368
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Physiological

369
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,839
Physiologically capable of detecting

370
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
Changes in electromagnetic fields that

371
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Really means anything

372
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
There was a study a few years back done by a geophysicist

373
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Caltech

374
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,639
This guy wanted to know whether just simply whether human brains were even

375
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,711
Capable of responding to changes in the magnetic fields around them

376
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Leaving aside how it could happen is it was happening

377
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
People people in a dark box where he could have just

378
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
The field inside and quote

379
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
The experimenters recorded dipson the amplitude of alpha brain waves

380
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,279
Is in a third of the participant

381
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,399
There are a ton of caveats but even so this is a pretty interesting result for this trial

382
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
But what does it mean

383
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,799
Does it mean that we have electromagnetic abilities that are dormant and we don't even realize it

384
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Probably not

385
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,663
And it might not even mean that we have what you traditionally call ascent

386
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,831
It is article the Smithsonian thorsten Ritz a biophysicist at UC Irvine Irvine had a great quote

387
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,159
If I were to stick my head in a microwave and

388
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
Switch it on I would see effects on my brainwave

389
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
That doesn't mean we have a microwave sense

390
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,167
The decent articulated definition of apathy,

391
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Barry Pitt

392
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
Articles about this study were making the rounds in 2019 and I could easily see Alex reading a headline and disorder writing his own

393
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Story about it

394
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
I think that might be what's going on

395
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,223
Again this is all fascinating stuff and it's pretty exciting

396
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,063
See where this research will continue toward but the stuff Alex saying is a little much

397
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
He's taking a kernel of something event extrapolating it out far past the point where it be

398
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
I keep standing on Solid Ground

399
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,839
What was the ND seems to be getting into like epigenetics where the like instinctive pass generation

400
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Things are inherited

401
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
I don't know

402
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,959
Exactly how that applies or what is point even

403
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
Yeah that's always enjoyed learning about migration and the thing that I've learned her

404
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Repeatedly is every time somebody tells me

405
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Me how migration works

406
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
It will change

407
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,575
So I'm I don't trust how migration Works Beyond Magic

408
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
And then whenever they figure it out I'm going to be so excited to know

409
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
But until then

410
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
A lot of it also has to do with the Sun

411
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Speaking of the Sun

412
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
A lot of it has to do with internal clock

413
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
What's the weather like

414
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:30,752
Butterflies have in their antennae how do they have internal clocks they're not that big

415
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
You got tiny tiny

416
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
You know they want you to plug into

417
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
The Matrix

418
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Conduit

419
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Connect to the

420
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Sean

421
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
All the Third.

422
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Forgot

423
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Weider

424
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
In home

425
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Watching the

426
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
The Prado Matrix

427
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Chucky

428
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
VR real

429
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Cuz that binds

430
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Seymour the Third

431
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
And for even lower.

432
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Artificial

433
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Still like

434
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,904
Really wrestling to try and figure out what he's saying

435
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,440
Like what's the point

436
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
What are you driving

437
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
You can do anything

438
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,912
As long as you give me money

439
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
It does feel that way

440
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
Cuz we've got Okay so

441
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,104
The globalist want you to stay connected to the third dimension by way of

442
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
The Matrix or whatever

443
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
But

444
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,248
If you're someone like Alex then you understand the way there

445
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Geese

446
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,856
And butterflies migrate has to do with electromagnetic

447
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Things in their brain right

448
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,232
So if only you do the stuff that Alex does

449
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
You could migrate

450
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,584
I guess I just feel like what were

451
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
What his

452
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Like

453
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:06,240
Gameon that is an explanation

454
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
An explanation of like

455
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,824
You know

456
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Stuff is weird

457
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,640
What if we just

458
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,408
More like

459
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
Time

460
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
If we had the same abilities that he's describing

461
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
In like

462
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Birds

463
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
And I butterflies like

464
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
We just okay now we don't need GPS

465
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
I mean okay

466
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
What is a high school reunions but

467
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,072
A return to your home to breathe

468
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Right well

469
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
I guess but you can't you can't get there you know you're not going to be able to just stay away from flowers

470
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,920
Think there's a there's a pretty strong sense that this is just like

471
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
Go outside that seems to be like what the

472
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
The point of this

473
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
How to lock you

474
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
In the five senses

475
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
And worshipping at is the entire

476
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Existence

477
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
Distracted

478
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
Walking

479
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
The sound of a babbling

480
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Brooke is

481
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Hundreds of

482
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Times better than theirs

483
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,952
Do some Studies have shown the forest bathing can have a positive effect on people's mental state but these studies are far from

484
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Conclusive

485
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,864
And a review of existing research in the 2017 issue of the international Journal of Environmental Research

486
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
And Public Health

487
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Find some comfort

488
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
Locating biases and methodological

489
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Problems with the setup

490
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
All these previous studies that have been done on the health benefits of forest bathing

491
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
I have some of them or like

492
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
People went out and had to walk in the forest

493
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
4 hours

494
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:57,856
It's like I could have a positive effect on your well-being but

495
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:04,256
Yeah yeah yeah that's not really a long-term solution

496
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
Your mental state to spend time outside

497
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
If Alex is just saying the people

498
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,400
Should spend time outside I guess that's cool

499
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,496
Like if resources just scolding is audience to get away from the TV and take a walk in

500
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Park it probably can't hurt

501
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm sure somebody to do

502
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
Mystical nonsense he's attaching to it is

503
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:27,040
I don't know if that's helpful but at this point I guess the worst that's going to come out of this is like an info Warrior trying really hard

504
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
To tell him what a worm is telling him

505
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Believing you can do some internal superpower to find the spot where he was conceived

506
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
UPS

507
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,560
It is it feels a little bit like he's like

508
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,680
Redoing the guru movement from the 60s for far-right

509
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,984
Conservatives you know like I'm a little Dumber

510
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Yeah yeah like a Ken Kesey called abuse

511
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,736
To have all of these people come get into a hot tub with a mini tell him about spirituality and be like I'm a

512
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
Psychologist again I don't think

513
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Alex is doing

514
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
No I don't think he's that committed today

515
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,536
I do I don't this does not feel connected to what's going on and he showed

516
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Generally

517
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Let's say I mean

518
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Stephen Butch

519
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Writing of what

520
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,472
Keep saying still feels soda

521
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
Disjointed and improvised

522
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:25,920
You know it's like somebody was like okay let me give you the bullet points and we're going to like Will Ferrell

523
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,808
All this movie until today Saturday to go until like has Paul Joseph Watson style jumps

524
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Sending audio

525
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Shocking

526
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
And annoying

527
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,488
Well it is annoying but it's over like this is the best you got after

528
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,072
That level of editor

529
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,632
You do it and this is what we get not good

530
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,776
Also when I was saying that like what's the worst that can happen is like trying to listen to worms or whatever

531
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
The case except for like Alex is using this ideology to demonize and invalidate medical interventions for Mentos

532
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Go health issues

533
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,296
Like stigmatizing people taking appropriate steps to address mental health challenges

534
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
This is just unacceptable

535
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,952
Like telling someone is dealing with a mental health crisis that they just need to listen to a babbling stream

536
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,328
That's the equivalent of telling someone who just broke their leg in a football game a rub dirt on it it's just

537
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,632
Really really unhelpful

538
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
All it'll do is

539
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,008
Make people less likely to take mental health issues seriously

540
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,336
And blame themselves when listening to a Brooke doesn't help

541
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
As listening to a stream as somebody who was very much instructed to treat mental health that way all

542
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
All the way up until I don't know

543
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Yesterday

544
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
I-88

545
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Brutal

546
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
Soccer

547
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,440
Brutal

548
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
Fux with your head for the rest of your life because you feel like you can't share stuff with other people because then you're there just going to say hey

549
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:53,472
Suck it up because you like fine I'll suck it up then stay silent and then later I'll die of can

550
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Demotivated

551
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
People to even

552
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,896
Experience

553
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
What they're feeling or

554
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
Look for help when they're feeling something they need help

555
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,784
Hell yeah

556
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Just I think that

557
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,880
I mean I don't want to say evil but that's

558
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,672
Awful I mean an awful Behavior

559
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,512
Years for me to even talk to my partner and be like hey I'm

560
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Fox man

561
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
So what you going to do

562
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,704
Well I'm going to play another clip

563
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Dammit

564
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Through the

565
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Environment

566
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
But I do work

567
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
God

568
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
Smoothies

569
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
Conduit

570
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Like an animal

571
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Connect me

572
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
Listening to some of this and it's starting to feel like

573
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,776
A little bit like poorly understood gnosticism

574
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,384
Like there's some there's some Vibes that I'm getting there pretty pretty gnostic

575
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
Who are the ideas of what recent Wars

576
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,528
Seems to be based on traceback pretty neatly to Gnostic cosmology

577
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,184
41 this whole thing seems to be based on the idea that there's something within us that's more than our physical selves and in fact

578
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
We're trapped in these physical body

579
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,376
According to gnostics thought each person has a Divine spark within them which is eternal compared to the physical body which is H

580
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
Shelf life

581
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,520
Juicy's interview on Alex's Alex's comments about the whole thing so far

582
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:37,152
It really seems like their goal is to wake people up to this reality and that the moon of the globalist have been trying to

583
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,432
Keep humans in the dark

584
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
About the fact that they are

585
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Actually spirit

586
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,344
Does the direct parallel to the Gnostic belief about the demiurge and the archon

587
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
The demiurge

588
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,024
The creator of this physical reality which is actually a false reality and there's like the real reality of the

589
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Picked it up laroma in the goddess fullness

590
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,192
Archangel Michael supposed to be in Catholic

591
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
Mysticism I'm not sure but in this case it's just the creator of the physical world

592
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,896
It's a goal of the demiurge and his minions these Arkansas

593
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
To keep Humanity from recognizing that they contain this

594
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
Divine spark which connect

595
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
The Ultimate Reality

596
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
It exists

597
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
Beyond the false reality that we are in

598
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
Even all of Oz talk to you about the out of the system w

599
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,000
Keep you in your home watching The Matrix screens because they

600
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Keep us in touch with the third dimension

601
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
That's exactly the strategy that the bad guys and gnosticism Hughes

602
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
Gnosis.org

603
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,776
Humans are generally ignorant of the Divine spark resident within them

604
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,640
This ignorance is fostered in human nature by the influence of the false Creator and his ark on

605
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,736
Two together are intent on keeping men and women ignorant of their true nature

606
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
And Destiny

607
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,856
Anything that causes us to remain attached to Earthly things serves to keep us

608
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,672
And enslavement to these lower Cosmic ruler

609
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,744
I'm very similar to exactly what I want to say

610
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
And now

611
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,864
I want to talk about how his Consciousness is God experiencing itself

612
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
This too is pretty rustic at its core

613
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
In the secret book of John the story is told of the Gnostic creation of the Universe and Everything essentially spirals

614
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,616
Outward from the Sun

615
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
The one

616
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
The father of fullness

617
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
What's the beginning of everything

618
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,552
This one views himself in a Wellspring of Living Water

619
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Experience

620
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Seeing him

621
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
Are experiencing himself

622
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
Gives birth to barbelo the embodiment of forethought

623
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,048
Who would become the creator of all these other entities that would inhabit

624
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
The fullness or diploma

625
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,376
Then again also

626
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:38,240
It could just be a situation where Alex's misremembering the Carl Sagan quotes

627
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:41,312
We are away for the cosmos to know itself

628
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
So could be a little bit of what

629
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,200
Palawan

630
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:52,064
I feel like imagining that Alex is actually aware of an able to grasp agnosticism is probably giving him

631
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
A bit too much

632
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Credit

633
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:58,976
It's interesting though how much of an overlap there is a lot of these ideas that are being articulated in reset worth

634
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,024
But maybe it shouldn't be that surprising

635
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:07,680
I don't think it's indicative of all people who follow gnosticism but there is a bit of history of Gnostic ideas being used to prop up

636
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
The worldviews of white supremacist

637
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
The Nazis

638
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:15,616
You can kind of easily see how Nazis might use the creation story to Aiden there demonization

639
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Jews

640
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:23,040
Some followers of esoteric branches of Nazi ideology like Miguel Serrano believe that the demiurges is the god of the old

641
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Old Testament

642
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:30,208
And consequently they believe that Jewish people are followers of the equivalent of Satan I feel like being interested

643
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
Gnostic ideas

644
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,096
Should make someone like be suspicious or like no big deal

645
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,936
But when it's combined with the rest of the stuff Alex believes in preaches to his audience

646
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Comes

647
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
Little bit I'm not sure I

648
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
I'm not into

649
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
I think it's bad

650
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
Yeah I say eyes and here's my pitch know but

651
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,968
Picked picked up on it so far but

652
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
I think we should just return to Sumerian gods

653
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Exclusively

654
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:00,928
Play like let's just do eggs boil

655
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
Stay where we were we were crushing it

656
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
I bet it all went to s***

657
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:10,144
We don't even know how to speak super anymore see well I know what is Erich von daniken

658
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Speak it perfectly

659
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
He does not know

660
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Nature's good

661
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
I've heard

662
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
It's good

663
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,360
Okay

664
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
The natural

665
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Horrible rap

666
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Why am I

667
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Lower third

668
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
I'm not saying

669
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Incredibox

670
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Part of Who We Are

671
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
Keep us only

672
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Allstate

673
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
We don't rely

674
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Stupid

675
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,384
Best friend Joe Rogan primarily famous because he was a commentator for the UFC

676
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,480
Meathead Bros that makeup is fanbase loved Newsradio

677
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,344
Maybe maybe they like Fear Factor but I don't believe I don't believe that's the primary

678
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
Reason he has an audience

679
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,232
Interesting contradiction that Alex is presenting

680
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,840
He constantly talks about how the globalist want to convince you that you're dirty and bad

681
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
There's a human you're doing

682
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Something wrong

683
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:20,288
Then here he seems to be juxtaposing the beauty and goodness of nature with the ugliness and evil of Times Square

684
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:24,896
But ultimately what is Times Square other than a representation of what humans can create

685
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,736
It seems like he's trying to save a human to decide to build cities

686
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,296
That dark to his liking or dirty in bed

687
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
But I'm not sure what he's based

688
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,136
That honestly seems very very weird

689
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,488
Yeah generally speaking the original sin

690
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,560
People like to just Define whatever it is they don't like

691
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Has

692
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,608
Spiraling offer

693
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:51,520
So that way you don't have to worry about whether another God's at it or whatever you're just like see your ugly and Evil.

694
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,128
Maybe something that speaks to a deeper aesthetic

695
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Pleasing Ennis

696
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,968
About nature then

697
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
What's a building

698
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Sure

699
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
You know I'm an indoor kid I I prefer cities

700
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,232
Obviously you and I have discussed me going outside many a time and I'ma

701
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,888
So I've I find his spirituality been to be ridiculous I'm constantly reminded of

702
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Achievements of mankind

703
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,288
But what is it about Time Square that Alex

704
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
Is opposed

705
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
2

706
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
New York cuz it's not consumerism

707
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
No not a lot of people probably would take issue with

708
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Is it campy pollution

709
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Which would be a problem that some people would have he doesn't

710
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,696
Really believe that the problem

711
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
I'm going to go with Melting Pot

712
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,048
Is apartheid

713
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,584
Pearl City

714
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
Time Square was in

715
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
F****** Florida

716
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
The scientist was ruling over

717
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,568
We wouldn't have a problem with it Factor do it

718
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Stressful there's a lot of people walking

719
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Pink around right

720
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,432
Well I mean if your basic

721
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
Underpinning of your philosophy is that

722
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
The races are under

723
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,624
Equal and can never possibly coexist is equals

724
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,184
Then where would be the most

725
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,512
Threatening thing in the world to you because it clearly shows you're wrong

726
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
That might be

727
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
That's why you got to go to Nature

728
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Be there to make you feel wrong

729
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
The globalist are creating virtual reality

730
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Right

731
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
At 8 I think

732
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
Alex has a weird

733
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
Theory about why they're doing it

734
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
Bubbles cleaner building

735
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
We are to get us out

736
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Make a trance

737
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
All of the

738
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,672
So we come to them and submit to them and do whatever they say in the great race

739
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Reset today

740
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Let's go outside

741
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:55,680
I want to need Source on the globalist claiming that they're creating VR in order to make us less warlike

742
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,472
I have not heard anyone say that

743
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,264
Yeah I was looking

744
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Some of this

745
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Gerard like

746
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,992
Applications that are possible of VR technology in therapy settings to work for like children who have problems with the gray

747
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,064
Absolutely research is pretty exciting

748
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
But I don't think that's what Alex

749
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Just talkin about

750
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
I'm sure that would be huge for like immersion therapy isn't something along those lines that I can actually use

751
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,424
Totally without actually having to go to Virtual Reality

752
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
You're able to hang out with a giant bee

753
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
Who's cool what is he having boyfriends butt

754
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
Basically we're just describing Alice in Wonderland when you could do that in reality

755
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,112
Then you're no longer afraid of bees infect you think they're your friend

756
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
One thing

757
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,304
I've always bums me out about people who are obsessed with the fact that we live in a simulation or obsessed with believing that we live in

758
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Dissimulation

759
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,888
Is how disappointing VR is

760
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
In a simulation

761
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
Eventually br

762
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Like what a bummer

763
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,336
To have shity VR inside the best

764
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
2BR but I hear it's gotten a lot better I haven't checked in

765
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,944
In quite a while in terms of

766
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Piano

767
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,832
I haven't tried VR in a long time and tried like the Oculus or what

768
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Wingstop is pretty

769
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,160
Pretty cool

770
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
What do I do with your I get what you're saying

771
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,512
Take me to

772
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
Also if we are in a simulation of gives a s*** if we enter a second one

773
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Like an otherwise I'm really matter

774
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,824
It's just Turtles all the way down

775
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,968
And we create this alternate reality that Mark Zuckerberg is running or whatever and we're all forced to enter it

776
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:50,368
Great Angela simulation start yelling at people in there nobody's being bothered

777
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,672
Build a video game inside of Minecraft

778
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
After you like fine

779
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,256
Yeah it's a great way to play it I don't care

780
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,560
Get inside that simulation early

781
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,144
Set yourself up as like a Saviour figure boom

782
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
Yeah it's like snow crash

783
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:09,824
Just like hero you got to be there you got to be on the ground floor of the net and then you then you're good to go there you go

784
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,176
We talked already about how this is clearly there's cuts

785
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,968
Multiple takes going on

786
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
I would have cut

787
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
This

788
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
I would have done a second take on this

789
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,392
For sure

790
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
This is the reason

791
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
The great reset is

792
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
The Old World Order

793
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
The tyranny

794
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Trying

795
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,120
Suppress the Great Awakening

796
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:40,032
Okay so the old world order is folks like Klaus Schwab in the tyrant

797
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:43,616
It's right there. Alex and his buddies are engaged in the Great Awakening

798
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:49,248
And from this one might be inclined to say that if Alex and his buddies were successful they be creating a new world order

799
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
It would certainly be a world order that was new and different from the old world order I don't know what else you'd call it then a new one

800
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:02,048
World Order I'm so frustrated because just a few months ago he called them the New World Order

801
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:06,656
The Old World Order

802
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
You can't be

803
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,520
The new guy all your life cannot believe he wouldn't

804
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:16,896
Just like oh wait hold on

805
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
All of my ideas

806
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Oh well

807
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,504
This video ends with a call to action

808
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Of course

809
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,552
Join me now

810
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,576
20 today

811
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Reset War

812
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Globalscope

813
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
I open

814
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
You got three wheels

815
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
I have free will and I'm not going

816
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Power somehow Force

817
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,616
Maybe I'll join your dumb s***

818
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
So

819
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,760
The times going on like Alex putting up these promos for recent Wars

820
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,784
I don't know it

821
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Means

822
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
I don't get any sense

823
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,136
Of what this is the temperature

824
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
Esoteric pseudo-spiritual Babel

825
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
Like I do

826
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,280
Don't even know what's going on just buzzword

827
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:11,936
It's pretty detached religious Concept in Fort Worth Tarrant all being mixed into a stew

828
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,288
The only thing I got through line that I can find it like he's desperate to get people to sign up

829
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
That's basically all I've got

830
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,224
And that feeling of desperation could even pronounce when Alex released another promo for reset Wars that was titled

831
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,320
How Joe Rogan's Awakening affect the great reset

832
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:32,928
Eagle-eyed observers noted that this headline news the wrong spelling of effect

833
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,536
And as such the technical meaning of the title this video is that Joe Rogan's Awakening

834
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Cause the Great

835
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Reset

836
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,400
Imagine that isn't what Alex was trying to convey

837
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
I'm pretty sure this is

838
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:49,824
Just another case of bad editorial at Infowars and now it's doing everything you can to constantly remind people that he's friends with Joe Rogan

839
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
Amuse that Association to sell his balls

840
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
You got it

841
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,199
By this point to Promos in I was

842
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Not expect

843
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,807
Too much but this is the video where Alex is contemplating the flower

844
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
The report we put a Twitter picture up

845
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
So I couldn't resist as he's looking

846
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
Stone flower

847
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,255
So anyway here is here's where we start on this

848
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
Do you know world

849
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
What we call

850
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
You're always so hard

851
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Core program

852
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
This goes to a Bazaar

853
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,447
Notion that I've seen in other reset Wars promotion

854
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Materials

855
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,799
And that has to do with the idea that when you're born you're a blank slate

856
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Like there is just nothing going on

857
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,247
And everything that is bad interesting or whatever is stuff that has been pushed

858
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Sit upon you

859
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,551
Like negative feelings

860
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
Self-doubt depression

861
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,951
These are all viruses bad programming that has been put upon you by the global

862
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Dumb

863
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,887
I mean it's a goes counter to the thing he's supposed to believe

864
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,751
Epigenetics and stuff

865
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
Runs counter pretty heavily

866
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
There's a lot of

867
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Counterpoint

868
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,503
Yeah Alex himself will just bring up

869
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
But yes look did the bad guys hate

870
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,671
In a sense because it's a new life that hasn't been corrupted by their

871
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Other system I guess

872
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Whatever

873
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
How do you know who else is innocent and like

874
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
Totally cool

875
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Shelter Rogan

876
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,167
Alex

877
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Yeah they're cool

878
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
F*** you

879
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
The most alive

880
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Celebrating

881
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
It's just funny

882
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
Pizza think back on like

883
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
Nonsense ideas words like

884
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
About me to why are you so popular Alex Jones

885
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,375
Well for the same reason that the most popular podcaster in the world is popular his final wonderful

886
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:58,239
Great dad I don't know if you remember but back when he was trying to go Sneaky Snake

887
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,359
And expose Joe part of it was talking about Jose kids

888
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
Which was gross

889
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Personal attacks

890
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
Saint Joe's

891
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:12,831
Children let's listen to few clips from February 5th

892
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,671
2019 when Alex was going to war with Rogan

893
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
And then

894
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
It's insulting like I still want to hug you

895
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
I don't like you

896
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
I'm guilty

897
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
I need a bad news 20 years ago

898
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
I should have ignored that

899
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
Are Charming.

900
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,871
I want war Joe

901
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,943
I want more I don't want to be nice

902
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
I want a cleanser

903
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Hyundai

904
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:47,903
So it changed wasn't letting you on his show and let you on about

905
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:54,047
He's always been the greatest guy in the world as opposed to I knew you were bad news 20 years ago

906
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,607
Guy who won't let me on the Shelf

907
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,191
Yeah it doesn't feel like Alex ever grew out of that

908
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
7 year old level of under

909
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,127
Understanding where it's like I want to go outside no you have to go do your homework

910
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:13,247
You're my favorite person in the world I have no Rogan

911
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,135
I'm running away with you

912
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
So I think it is

913
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,743
This video is largely just

914
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
Vague platitudes

915
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Essentially I mean nothing

916
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Following

917
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
Globalist

918
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Culture

919
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Obliterate

920
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
All of that

921
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
Will

922
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
So they can impose

923
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
None of us really even means anything I can do

924
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,943
Saying things at Times Square

925
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
The important thing about being a

926
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
Call it later is

927
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Be as vague as possible

928
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,159
And then when somebody is like what are you talkin about you say

929
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
What are you

930
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Feel like I'm talk

931
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,535
And then whenever they say some b******* back at you or like see

932
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,911
The Revelation is upon you as well even better thing to do is just be super vague

933
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,983
The fallen on science and then never make yourself available to be quiet

934
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,383
Well that one's good but you're not going to get let off with that kind of behavior

935
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,783
Field mechanics that he's looking for a couple bucks

936
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
That's true

937
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,879
You can get a lot of money if you got a strong call to

938
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
Alex makes a bizarre

939
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
Claim here he seems to be saying

940
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
That

941
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
The globalists

942
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
Are trying to

943
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,399
Force VR goggles onto children

944
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,983
And I see no evidence of this being the case

945
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Albany

946
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
VR goggles

947
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
The imposition of

948
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,295
Real life Matrix

949
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
Onto them

950
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
Crush and destroy

951
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Child

952
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
That's not godly quotes

953
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Yai

954
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,959
Don't know how I feel about

955
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,775
The notion that kids are being forced into VR goggles

956
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,079
I know that

957
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,711
All you have to do to switch things up as far as fake quotes go is

958
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
You know

959
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,063
Far-right Thomas Jefferson said it new age

960
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
Gandhi said it baby that all you got to do pretty good sister sample

961
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,047
So do you think they're forcing

962
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,655
I didn't get off this I will tell you the image in my head that popped in

963
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
Because of the way that Alex

964
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Has built these people up

965
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
I get the sense that like they don't even have the ability to

966
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,127
Control it like if you put a globalist inside of a cage

967
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:26,527
They were and then like let him out with a bunch of Greece children around they chase him with a VR helmet be like

968
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
Or even

969
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:33,183
Like more to the point you put them in a cage and then you like

970
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
Sneak in like

971
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:40,351
A doll of a child it will think it's real

972
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:46,751
TV shows this is all set up

973
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
I don't

974
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
Yeah I don't I don't think this is accurate

975
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
Cool

976
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,991
So Elon Musk tweeted something that's similar

977
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
Theme to some of the ideas that Alex

978
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
Apparently putting in to reset Wars

979
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
My male baby

980
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Information

981
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Talking about

982
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Exact

983
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,631
Information

984
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
In the 6-hour class

985
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Is what month

986
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Radio wasn't invented

987
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Technology was already there humans

988
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Just

989
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Discovered

990
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,743
It's fun to say that three people invent did radio on different continents in the same week but that's

991
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
Because I wasn't being specific I'm honestly not even sure who the third person he's claiming invented radio is but the cover art

992
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,983
Comes down to Tesla and Marconi is being two people

993
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,799
Most appropriate to say are the inventors of radio

994
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,871
Which is to say that your wireless communication

995
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:02,527
Each of them has a pretty good claim to the title Tesla was the first to demonstrate wireless radio in 1893

996
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,599
Years later Marconi got the first patent

997
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,903
For wireless telegraphy telegraphy

998
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:13,023
Though Tesla got to the actual radio thing first Marconi would be the first person

999
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,071
Beside the signal across the Atlantic Ocean

1000
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
Really pretty

1001
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,911
The correct answer in this debate

1002
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
Is the inventor of radio is Marcone

1003
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
And we know that from 1

1004
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
Very

1005
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
Piece of information

1006
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
I can't believe you

1007
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:38,111
Fitbit today

1008
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
That's right

1009
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
Marconi plays the Mambo

1010
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,935
The radio don't you remember

1011
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:58,335
You know it's trouser Starship at that point

1012
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,895
Nowhere though

1013
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:05,759
James Clerk Maxwell who formulated equations about how electricity and magnetism

1014
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
1865

1015
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
And in 1886

1016
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,183
Heinrich Rudolf Hertz made a proof-of-concept that electric current

1017
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,487
Could quote be projected in the form of radio waves

1018
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,887
You can even predate the invention of radio as a broader concept back to 1866 when

1019
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
Quotes that wireless telegraphy work

1020
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,287
This kind of putting it mildly

1021
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:34,943
In October 1866 Loomis used to kites between 14 and 18 miles apart

1022
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
Vertical antenna

1023
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,551
High frequency detector and espark.app transmitter to

1024
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
To conduct his experiments

1025
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:47,487
Is credited by the Library of Congress is the first known incidence of Wireless aerial communication

1026
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:53,119
The transmitter and detector work together to successfully cause one kite to move the other

1027
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:57,215
Speaking to one another through radio waves

1028
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
For a dude in the middle of the Civil War not bad not bad

1029
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:09,503
It wouldn't be until 1915 that any speech would be able to be transmitted across the country from New York to

1030
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
Francisco and the concept of radio for entertainment purposes

1031
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,855
Wouldn't come along

1032
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
For quite a while after this

1033
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,743
The idea that radio was invented by three people on continent

1034
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,047
It's in the same week

1035
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Just decided it was true

1036
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,935
It's ultimately meaningless as a clam though since the development of what we know is radios Annex

1037
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
The cover the better part of 100 years

1038
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
To come from its conception

1039
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,335
Formulation and then implementation

1040
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,895
Although now that I thought about it

1041
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,711
Just saying the three people magically came up within the same weeks

1042
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
More fun

1043
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Yeah

1044
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,855
I'm probably more profitable one of the most destructive points of view of History

1045
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
In all

1046
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Time is that great

1047
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Man.

1048
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
Like

1049
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,999
Not even just

1050
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:58,399
The inventors or anything like that or or the scientist or or

1051
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
Actions before them

1052
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
Thousands of people

1053
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:07,359
Thousands upon thousands of people doing research all the time in communication with each other and some

1054
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:13,503
Sometimes not and sometimes not build the basis for these are called invention

1055
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Do you know it's not like

1056
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,111
It's not like all we was there to be discovered it's that there were

1057
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,903
People work

1058
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,303
Yeah there's a lot of things that are very fascinating in terms of simultaneous Innovations

1059
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
Any breakthroughs that happened

1060
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
And sometimes it's

1061
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
It's pretty hard to explain

1062
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,423
Why

1063
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,959
Those things

1064
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:39,359
Explain how it's possible these things were people came to the same conclusion

1065
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,199
This Innovation was based on a breakthrough that happen

1066
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,599
Previously that people are both working off the same competing against each other as well

1067
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,695
Explain everything but it does explain

1068
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Something

1069
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,071
Yeah so here is beat the end of

1070
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
A video of those

1071
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,703
Supposed to be a promo that had to do with Joe Rogan and didn't really have that much

1072
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,983
To do with Joe

1073
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
I don't know why this

1074
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
Was titled

1075
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,383
Joe Rojo Joe Rogan's Awakening affect the great reset

1076
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,783
Except for Alex wanted Joe Rogan be the title if you put Joe Rogan the title and people search Joe Rogan Maybe

1077
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,367
Pop-up marketing

1078
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Don't let them

1079
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
Crusher will do

Join me there

1097
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,167
Boots

1098
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
Like that

1099
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,031
Really dangerously close to saying choose life

1100
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,895
Giving me a chance to play some lineup

1101
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,759
That's not how bored I was getting with these these promos by their 25th

1102
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,575
Starship city shows up

1103
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,671
It's not cuz you were interested in the material for the hoopla

1104
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,767
Saudis promos

1105
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,047
Socks

1106
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,191
And I did not feel like I had a better sense of what any of this was it was just

1107
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,055
Especially if you're somebody who like myself who's gone

1108
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Through

1109
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,871
Like a lot of self-help

1110
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,967
Through a lot of self-help so put likes seeing a lot of these blogs

1111
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:55,551
These message boards of people trying to push this nonsense

1112
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,879
Stuff like

1113
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
This just sounds like any kind of

1114
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,023
Vague platitudes being used to try and sell something

1115
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
What

1116
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
On Sunday December 12th

1117
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
Alex announced it at midnight

1118
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
He'll be releasing

1119
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
The biggest

1120
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,215
The most important piece of work

1121
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
Recent Wars

1122
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:20,127
And I didn't know if I should take this seriously because he's done this in the past and it has not come out

1123
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
What

1124
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
At midnight

1125
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Exactly

1126
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
@midnight reset Wars change

1127
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
From being a

1128
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,623
Fill in your email and you'll get an announcement

1129
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
To being

1130
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
A new page

1131
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
At the top of it there was a video

1132
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
Those Alex sitting at a desk

1133
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,303
7 Minute long video

1134
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
It's just meaningless it's

1135
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Just

1136
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:50,591
Him reading a script to clearly like he's going 4.8

1137
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
Point B

1138
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
Not saying anything but he's

1139
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,687
At least like this is off-the-cuff

1140
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
This was him reading

1141
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
It was

1142
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
It's a disaster is fad

1143
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
Horrible video

1144
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,391
And a lot of the scriptures reading is actually

1145
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,927
Covered in

1146
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,719
The text on the page

1147
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
It's way too long

1148
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
It's

1149
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Reformat it

1150
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,679
And it's presented as a letter from the desk of Alex Jones

1151
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,447
Good God

1152
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
A letter

1153
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
Yeah

1154
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,335
It starts my dear fellow Patriots

1155
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
Jesus

1156
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
There's there's a number of things

1157
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,455
Things that jumped out to me

1158
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
I am at one of the first things

1159
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
Is a visit there's no there's no way out

1160
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,367
It's so out of his voice

1161
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
It has no

1162
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:41,791
I word choice similarities that Alex uses it is

1163
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
It's outrageous

1164
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,631
Like halfway down the page

1165
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,679
Beginning of it pretty boring

1166
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,471
It sure you stand her just kind of like

1167
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,799
You know what we heard in the recent Wars part 1 episode 2

1168
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,127
It's kind of like a globalist

1169
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,455
The page business starts to pick up

1170
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,271
There's a section with a big bold headline

1171
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,039
They wanted

1172
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,367
Install viruses into you and keep you from realizing your power

1173
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,439
Here we get back to this idea of the

1174
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,463
Blank slate

1175
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,999
Here's the stats section

1176
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
True...

1177
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,191
By using social conditioning they install viruses of negative emotions self-sabotaging behaviors

1178
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
Self-loathing

1179
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,263
Depression anxiety and many more

1180
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
When were first born our minds are completely blank slates

1181
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,919
It's why you see so many babies with thousand yard stare

1182
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,455
They're taking it

1183
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:37,855
Lot of babies staring into the middle distance

1184
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:43,487
Call the bus while it's raining outside wondering where their relationship with Raynaud's more baby

1185
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,631
Alright text they're taking in all the data from the world around them and trying to process it

1186
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:56,287
These viruses start getting planted When We're Young through movies television music and especially nowadays social media

1187
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:58,591
You all this babies on social media

1188
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Every time they said play Mozart for your baby in the womb but they weren't telling you if it's installing virus

1189
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,319
Susie inside your baby's head that are making them stare into the middle distance

1190
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
Yeah and I accidentally for my baby I accidentally play Tupac Hit Em Up

1191
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
Call your phone

1192
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,655
Program people with a belief that they're not enough and they're flawed worthless creature

1193
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,703
Bluewater unpack there

1194
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,751
Like first babies are not blank slate

1195
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,591
It's as we discussed and in many cases of mental illness has a genetic basis

1196
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,199
Like the idea of this being presented is stupid in the main effect that it can have it

1197
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,991
It's further stigmatize mental illness

1198
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,527
Dissuade people from seeking help

1199
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
And like I said earlier I find that to be repulsive

1200
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,647
Yeah I'm not bipolar type one because I just can't

1201
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:51,327
No I think it's because you're on social media as a baby could have been an early adopter

1202
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Friends

1203
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,423
The second point I have is like

1204
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
I think this is really important

1205
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,543
I was noticing it also as I was getting to this point

1206
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
The text is written and formatted intentionally

1207
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,175
To be like subconsciously persuasive

1208
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,503
Their paragraph breaks after every sentence

1209
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,551
Oh God

1210
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:17,439
Digestible tidbit and almost all of the sentences Trail off with ellipses

1211
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,511
Ending sentences in ellipses is a subtle marketing

1212
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,303
Amtrak that's used

1213
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,375
A couple different responses from readers

1214
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,703
The first is that it gives the impression that a thought has more

1215
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,519
Become which inherently builds tension in the reader's mind

1216
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,383
This has the effect of making the reader less likely to get bored and stop reading because the ellipses

1217
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Text Amanda thinking

1218
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
Did something big is coming

1219
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
The second effect of lips

1220
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
She's having writing as a bait indicate ink

1221
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
Complete thought

1222
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,111
Which allows the reader to mentally engage with a text

1223
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
And fill in the blank with something

1224
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
Which creates a subconscious connection

1225
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
Whipper with a reader and what's being red

1226
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
This is something

1227
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Canby

1228
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
Khalid on an ad copy

1229
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,911
But the way that's being overused in this text is almost embarrassing

1230
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,287
It denotes an awareness of this technique in persuasive writing but almost no awareness of

1231
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,079
How to use it appropriately

1232
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,103
Like if you use it

1233
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
Every set

1234
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,711
The formatting looks like s*** and it becomes obvious that you're trying to pull a fast one

1235
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,831
Obviously I'm not saying this is like brainwashing s*** it's just tacky persuasive writing trick

1236
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,111
That's being embarrassing

1237
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Singly overused

1238
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
A text but

1239
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Nintendo Super

1240
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,023
Clear yeah you can you can either be

1241
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,071
Using manipulative techniques

1242
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,119
Or you can be riding like a first grader

1243
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
They're very

1244
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
There is no they can seem similar but they are very different in fact

1245
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,383
The first grader for all of the other manipulative tricks

1246
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407
What are you

1247
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,967
Another section A little bit later uses this headline

1248
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,319
My goal in writing you this letter is not to convince you this is happen

1249
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
If I wanted to do that

1250
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,719
I could write you a letter the length of a book filled with proof

1251
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,839
If you don't believe it already even though these Elites have failed to keep their wicked plans

1252
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,143
For the third-dimensional control the

1253
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
Secret...

1254
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,983
I wouldn't read the word further this letter

1255
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:09,823
This letter is intended for the person who already knows this to be true

1256
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:16,479
That's you isn't it you understand what's happening at 1st and what's happening

1257
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,039
You know why this letter is of so important right

1258
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,879
This is just Elementary level persuasive bulshit

1259
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,183
Elizabeth sporting three very basic

1260
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,743
The first is fake personalization

1261
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:31,583
This is imagined to be Alex writing you this letter which is just nonsense

1262
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
If only because there's zero chance Alex Rose

1263
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,727
This is Jake Ducey writing as Alex I've almost no doubt of that

1264
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:43,359
The second trick is that it's creating the impression that by not putting this letter down

1265
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
You've somehow proven that you're one of the elect

1266
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
You understand the reality that others are too

1267
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,247
You dumb or stubborn

1268
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
Accepting the proof of that is a fact

1269
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
You don't need this letter to prove anything

1270
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,695
This is a really common manipulative marketing tool and it works pretty well because

1271
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:02,303
It essentially flatters the reader but the only thing the reader can do to Merit that flattery

1272
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,095
Is not walk away from the sale

1273
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,167
Well yeah you got a not walk away from

1274
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Is the use of questions

1275
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,287
You know the reader is prime to answer affirm

1276
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,079
Like it's really Bass

1277
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
Sales trick to get the person that you're trying to sell something with you about something

1278
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,247
To answer in the affirmative is to create a connection

1279
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,295
Get them saying yes early

1280
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:30,975
Another thing is important to understand is that this isn't just a sales technique it's usually a closing technique

1281
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
Usually want to create that saying yes as a way of getting

1282
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:40,447
Someone say yes to this ale I spent 10 years in sales and I was told by a lot of

1283
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,287
Very shady salesman how to make sales

1284
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
Be asking these questions unless you know the answer is yet right

1285
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:54,527
When it's like you know that this is important because you're great right

1286
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,879
Bet you're a super smart person right you're the smartest person I've ever met

1287
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:04,511
If you pay close attention to how this s*** is written like this copy a large portion of it is

1288
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Just

1289
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,071
Like used car salesman

1290
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
Closing techniques

1291
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,655
Little bit later we get another

1292
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,935
Manipulative sales tax

1293
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,519
I'm giving you the globalist entire Playbook

1294
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:20,383
So you can protect yourself from their attack on your freedom your mind your soul...

1295
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
We're calling it reset Wars

1296
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,271
I'm risking my life in my own freedom to share with you the elites

1297
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,343
Secrets of how reality actually works

1298
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
So you could use it to your benefit

1299
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
Dot-dot-dot

1300
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,975
I'm going to review what they're trying to hide so you can

1301
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,815
You can see their mind games from a thousand miles away...

1302
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,839
And you're going to

1303
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:46,239
To discover exactly how to fight back against the New World Order so you never end up a slave for their evil power...

1304
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,823
Reset Wars has the most detailed explanation of what's current

1305
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,615
We going on in the world...

1306
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,895
I can't tell you

1307
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:59,295
Exactly how deep this goes in this public website cuz they're already got damn prison...

1308
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,183
That's so good

1309
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,583
Yeah I tried all the way down to that I would throw sit at the wall

1310
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
Here you have the false impression that the salesperson is risking something by text

1311
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
You just go to the Omni

1312
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,567
Play this is

1313
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,895
This is too much even for me but listen I know it's important

1314
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
To you right

1315
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,711
And I'm just such a good person

1316
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,783
Such a good person I am willing to take this even a step

1317
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Further

1318
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
And I will throw in

1319
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
2 bath mat

1320
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:39,999
It's just that exact same thing but being Amplified to life-or-death Stakes for Alex or whoever is writing this

1321
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
Pretending to be a Leo

1322
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,887
Here you see the promise of this dangerous secret information that can't be revealed on a

1323
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,911
Public website

1324
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:51,263
For some reason because the writer this is being threatened with prison that doesn't make any sense

1325
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
This kind of

1326
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
Classic chest

1327
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,079
Not the Creator

1328
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,151
Super inflated impression of what's inside the magic

1329
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
Boxed

1330
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
It's too dangerous

1331
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,735
Steven open

1332
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Publix

1333
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,831
Also I would assume that it makes more sense to release

1334
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:10,463
That on a public website if you're being risks and there's a risk of being arrested

1335
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,023
Go ahead and get that out secretive

1336
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:19,167
No that you need to be arrested or something it don't snatch

1337
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,823
I can't tell you anyways though everything now

1338
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,639
Manipulative techniques that are way too liberally employed

1339
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,455
Thermite to lead you up to the actual cell

1340
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:35,295
We've put together a special offer for anyone reading this letter

1341
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:41,695
The material inside reset Wars is going to be retailing at $297

1342
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
More in the near future however

1343
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
For me

1344
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,287
We we are having a pre-launch member special at 25% off for a limited time...

1345
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,943
Taking the price down to just 222. I can't say no to that's so pathetic

1346
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
Even further

1347
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
Quote

1348
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Listen

1349
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:12,159
It's as simple as signing up with

1350
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:17,023
Immediately recognizable listen-only as in parentheses a****** after

1351
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,887
It's a simple as signing up and you'll get access to the material right away

1352
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,703
Here's why you need to take action right now.

1353
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
Dot-dot

1354
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,031
Currently there's an active subpoena out for me

1355
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,079
They're trying to take me to court so they can

1356
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,895
Completely shut down Infowars along with all my Prada

1357
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,711
And possibly even send me to prison

1358
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
They've already shot me down on all social media platforms

1359
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Stop.

1360
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,135
I'm even getting death threats every single day from Anonymous numbers

1361
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
Dot-dot-dot

1362
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
They're doing everything in their power

1363
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,511
Stop me from exposing these evil powers to the world

1364
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:51,071
I truly have no idea what's going to happen

1365
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,631
Or if they're going to succeed and shutting me down

1366
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
And if they do end up getting rid of

1367
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,727
Meet... You won't be able to get access

1368
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:58,751
The truth

1369
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,823
You won't be able to share this truth with the people you care about

1370
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,615
You won't know how to fight back

1371
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
This is why it's so important that you act

1372
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,711
Now before it's too late

1373
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
This is such a

1374
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,039
Amazingly abusive at the things

1375
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,183
To do to your audience I have not heard that many ellipses does O'Malley

1376
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
A****** taught me Emily Dickinson Street you know the places that I would like

1377
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
You reading text fragment

1378
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
Translate

1379
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,823
Piece of paper is missing

1380
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,943
These were standings for like a series of swear words

1381
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,759
None of the sacraments that are being a

1382
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,575
Express your are real this is all just more sales tricks

1383
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:49,183
Primarily creating the impression that people have to act now or they'll never be able to get

1384
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,207
Thing that you're selling

1385
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,607
This creates the artificial sense of immediacy where you have to act now it helps override people's rational thought process

1386
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,911
Reminder for second

1387
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
That any of this was

1388
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,727
Actually what Alex's position is

1389
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,031
Think about what a horrible piece of s***

1390
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
The traitor to his body

1391
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
PNC would be

1392
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,175
Give this six-hour course that he's created that's the way to defeat the globalist

1393
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,455
The enemy is that he's been

1394
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,503
Convincing battle with

1395
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
For over 20 years

1396
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,391
Many of these people are probably sacrificed quite a bit to follow Alex whether it's

1397
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
The respect of their peers or

1398
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,255
Money that they spent on keeping him on air so the fight

1399
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,535
To continue and Alex

1400
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
Keep documenting it for that

1401
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Goddamn

1402
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
Custody has been lost over Alex

1403
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:36,031
I'm here is the sales pitch for the course and if you believe this s*** without the course you won't

1404
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:39,103
Be able to if you quote won't know how to fight back

1405
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
You quote whoop

1406
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Be able to access the

1407
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,479
This is not an overstatement to say that

1408
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Is critically important

1409
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,063
Stuff for you to have if you want to save yourself

1410
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,623
Go to save your loved ones in the rest of the world

1411
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,415
You can even argue that

1412
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,719
The key to defeating the globalist is actually this

1413
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,279
Information getting out to as many people as possible

1414
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,583
Instead of providing this information

1415
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,607
Alex with Holt

1416
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,399
Advance over $200

1417
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,983
Give you access to this information without which of your helpless to fight back

1418
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
Against the devil

1419
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,871
Even though the best-case scenario where Alex actually believes all the complete

1420
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,663
Bulshit that's being set on this webpage

1421
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
He's a monster

1422
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,783
To be able to

1423
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:21,855
Ba bestowed life-saving information from him

1424
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:28,767
Thankfully I'm certain that Alex doesn't believe any of this s*** and it's just a cash grab so honestly it's just a standard Infowars bottle of f****** with

1425
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
With the audience of that monetize

1426
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
It's

1427
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
Awful that is

1428
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
So

1429
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
F******

1430
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
Naruto

1431
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,239
The idea of

1432
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
Oh man

1433
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,847
Imagine imagine if somebody had

1434
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,663
Follow this show for 20 years

1435
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
We were finally like okay

1436
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:52,575
We're ready to get rid of conservative evil forever

1437
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:57,439
It's behind a paywall

1438
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
Twenty-something years

1439
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,535
My figured out exactly how to get rid of Griffin

1440
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,351
I figured out the right-wing scam

1441
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,143
And I know the exact solution

1442
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
If

1443
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,471
You are aware of this and you don't understand this

1444
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
Your dad should already know Adonis

1445
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,895
Is there a short. Of time where you're going to be able to get this thing that I've created because

1446
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Can take me down

1447
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:26,623
25% off from you in order to

1448
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:33,279
I mean you know what to a certain to a certain point of view though if you're a group of people who believe the

1449
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:38,399
That you are safety and life is dependent upon spending $1,000 on an automatic weapon

1450
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:43,775
It seems like it makes sense to think that you should pay Alex 222 dollars

1451
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,359
No it doesn't

1452
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,431
Find a gun is buying anything

1453
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,991
Cool or whatever

1454
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,807
No it's not it's information

1455
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
This

1456
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
If this information is good

1457
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
And it actually is transformative in people's lives

1458
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,095
Help a boy more than $200

1459
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,631
If he gives it for free

1460
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,191
Totally the amount of money he would get

1461
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,775
From people just wanting to support him for being that

1462
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,335
A generous and that that caring

1463
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
I would be

1464
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:19,871
IFly

1465
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,199
Compared to whatever he's going to be getting to these $200

1466
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,247
I guess this desperate cash grab

1467
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Yeah it's

1468
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,551
It's really sad

1469
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:31,647
You put out something worth something for free people will want to pay what

1470
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,927
It's worth and more

1471
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,303
Take a lot of people's experiences but I think

1472
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
Alex's is structuring this

1473
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
It's very obvious

1474
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
He has no faith

1475
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
And the thing that you

1476
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,007
Doing he's just banking on people not

1477
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,823
Getting mad I mean yeah it's it's

1478
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,383
The f****** Ted Anderson gold sales bottle

1479
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Of like

1480
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,991
As long as I get you to buy the first thing you're obviously not coming

1481
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
So I just need you to buy one thing and then what other things are going to be going to be another round of course

1482
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
He offers a 30

1483
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:12,607
EBay money-back guarantee

1484
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Globalism 30 days

1485
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
Think I think

1486
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,471
30-day

1487
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
Money back guarantee

1488
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
At least you could do I suppose

1489
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,383
But I also think there's pretty good reason to believe that most people want

1490
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,943
Take advantage of that because

1491
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
The way that this information

1492
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
Appears

1493
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
Tubi

1494
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Being presented

1495
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,367
The cryptic Miss of it

1496
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,415
The vagueness of the nonsense

1497
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,999
I think a lot of people will be prime to blame themselves

1498
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,863
They don't get the magical transformation that Alex is selling them

1499
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,239
I just didn't meditate hard enough or whatever visualize hard enough

1500
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:55,615
You see that a lot in like comment section Moto people who like like Dulce

1501
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,175
Who do this Law of Attraction stuffy nose like

1502
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:02,271
I haven't made the money yet but I'ma keep on trying I don't know I'm doing something wrong

1503
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
I need some advice on how to do this right

1504
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,647
And then 30 days

1505
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
Going to be up your refund there already

1506
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
In this place of like a

1507
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
You know

1508
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,143
If I admit I was conned on reset Wars

1509
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
How was I not conned

1510
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
On info

1511
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
How can you

1512
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
How can you be

1513
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
So f***** over

1514
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:30,175
With this b******* that you spent 232 Suboxone cost

1515
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
You know so either either you say well I got conned and he's been lying my entire f****** lie

1516
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,879
It would be a little threatening to to think

1517
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
If you if you're in

1518
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,743
For this right yeah that's

1519
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,303
Oh maybe 911

1520
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:54,751
So another thing that I find really fascinating is the disclaimer they needed to put at the bottom of the page

1521
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
It reads quote

1522
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:02,175
The contents of this program entitled reset Wars is designed for instructional and educational purposes only

1523
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:07,551
It expresses the views opinions and Analysis of Alex Jones and Alex Jones exclusively

1524
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
And such

1525
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,903
The content is not intended to represent or warrant

1526
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,535
The accuracy or truthfulness of any particular statement or any information disseminated.

1527
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:22,399
And accordingly Alex Jones as well as all individuals are ant

1528
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,215

1529

Disclaim any and all warranties or representations of any nature whatsoever

1530
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,479
Frankly we don't even want to put our f****** names on this s*** now

1531
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:42,879
He's getting all this money taking anyway but it's all Alex and I was also just claims that Halo

1532
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,951
By the truth of any of this

1533
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,279
What do you think this is been evaluated by the FDA

1534
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,375
Beyond that likes the ideas that he's

1535
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Saying or like

1536
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
Get the pieces of evidence he has four things

1537
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,799
Like if you were if you were a consumer and you're like hey this is a lie

1538
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,151
Algebraic I'd like to point you to the disclaimer where I never claimed

1539
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,015
You should know when you bought this that I had a

1540
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:16,415
Had a boilerplate sitting here that said yeah no s*** it's not real fine print where it says come at me

1541
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
And I will say

1542
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,207
Don't care

1543
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,487
Joker

1544
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,607
It wasn't true in the first place of course it wasn't true why else would I put this f****** decyfer down there

1545
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,887
Yeah it's a little sad

1546
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,167
Jesus a little sad

1547
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,751
We get to the Dilemma that I'm in

1548
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
It's like a CEO

1549
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,871
Commercial for f****** PetSmart is that they're being like

1550
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
Honestly I don't think this

1551
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Is very good program

1552
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,479
At all I don't think you should do this

1553
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,271
Jordan

1554
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
I want to

1555
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Distill

1556
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,135
No

1557
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,415
The actual course

1558
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
Obvious

1559
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
But

1560
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,255
I'm not paying

1561
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:58,655
200 something dollars for it I mean I don't want anybody who's listening to buy it and then give it to me or anything

1562
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:04,031
I don't want this money to go to him do not give him money but I still want to

1563
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:09,407
I don't have any idea what point he's even trying to make with these promos

1564
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
Reading over the copy it's just

1565
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Sales tactics

1566
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
And like

1567
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Audible bad

1568
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,671
I listen to that interview with Jake to see when he was on Alex's show and

1569
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
Nonsense

1570
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:27,071
About MKUltra the Wikipedia

1571
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,887
I don't know what it is I'm curious

1572
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
Most important work ever

1573
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:39,103
I don't know I don't know what to do maybe some archive obsessed infowarrior will put it out on B Tour

1574
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,687
Maybe get it from f****** The Pirate Bay

1575
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,479
Do you know who knows

1576
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Does me

1577
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,295
What an Alex

1578
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
I don't I don't know if some certainly some contradictory ideas about intellectual property

1579
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Yeah

1580
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,535
Typically

1581
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,863
I've had a rule against covering things that are behind a paywall

1582
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
Make it except

1583
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
And in this case but

1584
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
I still like

1585
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,519
I'm struggling with this

1586
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,823
But I also really want to make clear that I'm not

1587
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,639
Struggling in any performative way to try and get an audience

1588
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,783
To send it to me don't want that don't know what to do

1589
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:25,951
I think you're right I think eventually it's going to be posted somewhere

1590
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:30,047
It might be it might be a situation where we have a little bit of a delay before

1591
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
Park

1592
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:31,839
3 attack

1593
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Will get there

1594
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,191
Somebody's going to put it out

1595
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Frankly

1596
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,359
There's no way that it's really that sustainable for them to not eventually be like okay well the game is up

1597
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
We might as well just have it out

1598
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,783
Yeah it it may be it may be a situation where you just want to hit people

1599
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:52,575
For whatever it's worth

1600
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Upfront

1601
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,391
And then and then eventually

1602
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
Once there a warrant

1603
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,327
You. Is over

1604
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
Absolutely

1605
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
I think this is a little bit disappointing

1606
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,983
I certainly was very disappointed by this

1607
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,384
This entire path wanted to know more about what reset Wars was I don't feel like I do

1608
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
I do know that

1609
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:20,480
I think I think I know exactly what I knew before which is a f******

1610
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,136
Hat in the flower is a metaphor for a scam

1611
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
To Big scab

1612
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,976
I don't I don't feel like this

1613
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,024
Exploration has gotten us any closer

1614
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
Truth

1615
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,680
It won't be back for another reset Wars they want we know a little bit more

1616
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Galaxy

1617
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,032
Started his career man put it behind a paywall

1618
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,080
As the tip of the spear

1619
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
Fighting on your behalf

1620
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:53,248
The oncoming murder of the globalist

1621
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Just

1622
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,344
Unacceptable if you believe any of the premises

1623
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,184
If you believe that you're fighting against the literal devil and somehow

1624
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,744
Waking up of the population

1625
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,072
It has a bearing on whether or not you'll defeat the Devil

1626
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,376
The idea that you would have to pay wall is

1627
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:14,752
Absurd absurd and unacceptable

1628
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,360
Prohibitively evil yes beyond evil like that scarf

1629
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,408
Begging to a new level

1630
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,224
I'm fascinated by it like

1631
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
How you could

1632
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Defend that

1633
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:33,440
I don't think you could not put a lot of money into

1634
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:38,560
The course is just sitting at the desk

1635
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Look it's just

1636
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,984
It's not like he flew across the world to record himself

1637
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:51,616
Basically it's a show with a script that was written by a

1638
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
How do I will check back in

1639
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,992
But there's some big updates

1640
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
Primarily interested in this cuz this

1641
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,344
The show is it is

1642
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,624
It's mostly

1643
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,648
Vaccine

1644
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Conspiracies and then

1645
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:09,536
Apparently he said that whether weapons were involved with the tornadoes

1646
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:13,888
I mean what are you going to do we already talked about it as dumb belief in and whether weapons

1647
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,960
That again in this situation

1648
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:23,616
That's Craftsman he's truly he's trying to say whether weapons so people will talk about him saying weather

1649
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
Weapons that was bulshit

1650
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
I don't like it

1651
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:32,320
Back with another episode on Friday.

1652
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
Put our own letter up

1653
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,280
We're also on Twitter

1654
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:47,680
We are in 30 technology underscore fight night go to bed Jordan

1655
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:49,984
What the sex robot

1656
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:58,432
