00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200

We need to give an apology to Chumbawamba we implied that they had fascist leaving

75
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Mixed up in our mind

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
Because Chumbawamba parently are anarchist

77
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,143

Troublemaker

110
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Inside him

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,743
I told I always think that April Fool's Day is going to bring it out of them and I always think I've listened to

Happens

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
It doesn't happen today

118
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
To learn

119
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
About what time

120
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263

Fox News

130
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
When they're owned by

131
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
Controlled opposition these guys all are

132
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Alex

133
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Dia lot of his rhetoric creeping into the right-wing media

134
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
Self he started

135
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,319
See his narrative being mirrored

136
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
You saw her earlier with the Glenn Beck

137
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Serta thought that was an isolated case

138
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
But now a party becomes

139
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
More

140
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279

Past the original like

143
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Huge push rap

144
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,775
Tea parties all over the country

145
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
Glenn Beck

00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
12 starting

147
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
The pieces are starting to fall into place

148
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
His laundry is being aired

149
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
But he doesn't like who's doing that laundry

150
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
The terms of the black president

151
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
Starts out

152
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Who knows

153
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Why

154
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
We need a bigger boat

155
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,519
Maybe no that's okay

156
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,039
The secret government as the boat or whatever

157
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Assertive

158
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
What would you call it like

159
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
The skeleton of the house

160
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
In order to build that don't need the girders that Alex has

161
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
Isn't going to fly they don't have

162
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
And Alex has been working

163
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
15

164
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
8 years

165
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Building that f****** Foundation

166
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,615
Realized

167
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
What they realize they had to do

168
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,247
Illegitimate president

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Present

170
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Because he

171
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,903
Whatever other reasons they would have makeup

172
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
He has to be all-powerful and

173
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Timer

174
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,095
The same time being ineffectual and non-existent

175
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,495
They realize the effectiveness of that alive

176
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Alex has been doing

177
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
Who knows how much of that is intentional at all like

178
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,855
Come out here and say that Fox News

179
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
Looked at Alex and said let's get us some of that or anything like that

180
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Could be pure coincidence

181
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
How do we make this Morris

182
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Stream the possibility

183
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,911
It doesn't mean that they're ripping off Alex but Alex is it for sure

184
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
As he's being ripped off the American public

185
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
I want me some of that but I don't want Alex

186
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
Parking lot

187
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
Alex Alex

188
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Somehow

189
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,999
A Megan Kelly a blonde white woman spouting bigotry

Fox News

195
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
These

196
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
I don't know I

197
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Glenn Beck was on

198
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Yeah it was on

199
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
Diablo

200
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Alex

201
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
Does something that I do ever

202
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
At this moment

203
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Alex Jones

204
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Is this is

205
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
A turning point

206
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Funded the weatherman

207
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
Interesting Lee he had a harder time bacon billares

208
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,911
What the f*** are you talking about information

209
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
To back up his claims of all these

210
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Nefarious organization

211
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
We have never heard

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
Alex

213
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Say something

214
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
About

215
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
A boogie

216
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Puppet

217
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
The market April 1st

218
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
2009

219
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
Is the first time in our in our travels

220
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
We've heard that that

221
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
As

222
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Early as we

223
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
We can find

224
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Soros

225
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Now it's in

226
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Interesting to me phrases

227
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,679
Because it whenever you talk about these big bad guys before we heard it a hundred times

228
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds Rockefeller Foundation

229
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
This freezing is very familiar to me

230
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Present

231
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Further down the line

232
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Linguistic patterns

233
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
What's tomorrow's forecast

234
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Snoo

235
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
I don't know if it means anything

236
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
I'm not entirely sure

237
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
I need to give it some more examination

238
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
Particular phrase

239
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:50,815
Freezing of it that closure in the way that he rolls

240
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Three are the ones who

241
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
You were doing it that we've heard now a million

242
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Expected to come out

243
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
If he's adding shock collars

244
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,735
Fellers the Rothschild and Rose

245
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Sprint Center right away

246
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
Right I'm part of this could be a blip

247
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
It's entirely possible because George Soros

248
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Did come out and do an interview that I

249
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
I think it was ill-advised

250
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Because the propaganda

251
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Made about it

252
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
What are you talkin about how he was having a great

253
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Recession

254
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Because of the best petite

255
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
Did call a bunch of stuff and a billionaire

256
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
The recession

257
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Is it you should

258
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
And then the other things

259
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
Get here he had a lot of feelings about the

260
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
G20 and how was one of the last opportunities to save the global reach

261
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Assertive

262
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
The news around

263
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
2000

264
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
So I also

265
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
Consider the possibility

266
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
George Soros

267
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Evil Boogeyman

268
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Reaction to him showed up in the news for a bit

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
Soros Foundation combo

270
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Adjust

271
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
Throwing a minute player

272
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Is weird

273
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
I don't know we'll see what

274
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
What are the

275
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
2009 episode

276
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,215
Secretly Shadow country

277
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
So Alex has been real hot and bothered

278
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
About the

279
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Summit over there

280
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,551
Obama's going to go meet with the queen

281
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Is that

282
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
G20 protests

283
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
They're all

284
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,583
Apparently paid by Soros they're all fake

285
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
The opposition

286
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
Real opposite

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Which is him

288
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Everybody else is up

289
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Bunch of posers

290
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Johnny-come-lately

291
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Or something like that

292
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,039
Colter's

293
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
He knows

294
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
But they're not regular

295
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
The physical

296
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
All real Anarchy

297
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
One has to see it to believe it I have experienced

298
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
What's Ryan let's do something

299
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
Anarchist

300
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Unleashed

301
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
Marxist

302
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
The movie

303
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
Red-bearded Tommy

304
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
Shenanigans

305
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
No no no you misunderstood the story it was a different Cummings

306
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Marxist

307
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
And he is the one who's

308
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Delete it

309
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,951
The emaciated

310
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,047
The fake Antarctica

311
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,655
Xou talks to the leader red-bearded Potbelly

312
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
I do believe

313
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
Understand anybody who would do any of the actions

314
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
I do understand

315
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:57,087
Patrolling

316
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
Unfolding is a real series of events

317
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,535
Colorado

318
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
I guess he met one

319
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
Over there with his zits

320
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
I don't think

321
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
It's a real stereotype

322
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,879
Just be proof of Alex having that one anarchist

323
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Any thinks they're all like that

324
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
Heavy metal

325
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Maybe smoke map

326
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,887
A lot of

327
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Yep

328
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
A really sleepy

329
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
G20 update

330
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
I just don't want to look

331
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
That it all

332
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
They're basically just saying all the pictures you see you like protesters bloody

333
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
And stuff like that.

334
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,807
Let's just be water

335
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,487
That wasn't fake

336
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
20 Subs

337
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Because

338
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Alex

339
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Distracted

340
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
A b a b

341
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
Fight

342
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Coverage of Obama showing up

343
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Buckingham Palace

344
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,895
Just doing his British voice all over the place

345
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
All that stuff

346
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Then

347
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
You decide

348
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
He's going to blow everyone's mind

349
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
Sounds like you're going to be all three

350
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
This is real in fact I even

351
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Research on this

352
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:22,495
University

353
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,335
It's called the groom of the stool

354
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:32,735
Are you not going to discussion

355
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Practice of the groom of the stool

356
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Respect

357
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
It wasn't so much just wiping at Queens ass

358
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Is a close adviser

359
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Someone had to be with

360
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
The Royal at all times and all that back then

361
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Sometimes

362
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Caught up in the idea that

363
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
That it does

364
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
He is so defensive about the idea

365
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,711
At least an hour talking about the school

366
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
Not only does he spend an hour on it or so

367
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
He also has to call in a bunch

368
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Intrastaff

369
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,791
Tabac him up it's kind of crazy because that sounds exactly like something somebody who was

370
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,143
Pounds on me talking about for about an hour

371
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,239
Conversely kind of sounds like a mystery shows

372
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,919
Broadcaster who invented Monopoly

373
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
But it is first clip of that

374
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
Alex Erin Dyke

375
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
To talk about this

376
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
This is Phil

377
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Binational

378
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
To examine medical Wheaton

379
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
And I got to have it

380
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,440
Carted around and talk about this

381
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
State secrets of the

382
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
Stool

383
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,568
Thermistor

384
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,688
It is strange

385
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
What are you saying

386
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Aaron Dykes is actually right

387
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Pretty consistent

388
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Among a lot of heads of state

389
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
They don't let

390
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Just go anywhere

391
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
Because it is a state

392
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Secret

393
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
In Subway's

394
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,096
Because if the foreign hostile leader or whatever words

395
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Take their waste

396
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
Big Lot About

397
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Central Health

398
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,032
Blackmail them

399
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,848
If someway that could be exploited for

400
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
I don't I don't know what other ways other than

401
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,808
I think you are missing the number one way to exploit

402
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
Use it to clone a new Obama

403
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
Accelerated

404
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
Even able to do that

405
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:32,448
Cynthia 300

406
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
Took over China in

407
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
There is a

408
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
There is a sensible reason to visit doesn't have to do with like

409
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Or anything like that

410
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
Could tell a lot about a person

411
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,840
Because

412
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
I think

413
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
What I would think is

414
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
No tolls

415
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
Have you no decency

416
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
W bush had

417
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Misunderstanding Alex is lying about Aaron dykes

418
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
It's pretty close to right

419
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
At the same time neither of them

420
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:38,496
No that's a conversation any of Alex's

421
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Underlings conversation and let whatever his

422
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Frozen

423
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Let It Go

424
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
Okay

425
00:23:54,112 --> 00:24:00,256
Alex isn't satisfied Paradise backup

426
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Chameleon

427
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
Just fun to remember

428
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,176
Also it's fun to remember that

429
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
EEOC complaint against Alex grooming him for homosexual

430
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Hey Rob

431
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Sorry buddy

432
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
We're discussing the green

433
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Explain

434
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,752
This is real I

435
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,824
Aaron Goodwin gravel see you later

436
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
We read

437
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
At least 10.

438
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
10 minutes

439
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
They do it

440
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
You didn't read any of those reports

441
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,256
The picture that I want to present to you of

442
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
What's important about Alex's group of the school.

443
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,936
He is so defensive about the idea that people don't believe him think he's making it up to be grocer funny

444
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,008
Multiple employees real

445
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Coach with his life

446
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Google Hangouts

447
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Hey now I'm going to make Mark mad but agree with the school is

448
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:31,392
Honestly coaches more efficient

449
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
You see this show in Psych

450
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,256
Better

451
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
No I love

452
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Talk about

453
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,448
I would like this to happen forever you're probably right actually because

454
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
That should just

455
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Continue

456
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Kind of racist

457
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Try me

458
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Mice

459
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Directions

460
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
Careful

461
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:13,120
Careful rabbits

462
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
Name of other animals

463
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
And we are

464
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,032
A couple uses in there that make me think that this

465
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,064
What is what I feel what I hear that

466
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Let's beatbox

467
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,984
The last Australian

468
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Australia

469
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Understand

470
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
From jokes

471
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,016
The fact that I do about Australia are actually

472
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Jokes

473
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Basically

474
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,928
Conception where the

475
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Which we do you mean

476
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
The government is

477
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
Feeding off of them

478
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,144
Where is the government

479
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Yeah in the illegal immigrants

480
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
I don't think you're an animal in the bear or something like that

481
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,992
Just about the

482
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,808
Animal metaphor

483
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
What's throat to braces

484
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,136
I think

485
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
If you could eat you

486
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Confronted him

487
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
And you said hey Alex sounds

488
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Mighty racers

489
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,840
He would say I'm just talking about illegal immigrants I'm not

490
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Specifically say

491
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,264
What I mean

492
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,592
Unfortunately

493
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
A couple minutes later he takes

494
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,992
It's a call and things get a little too overt about what they mean by a grill

495
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Warren in Ohio

496
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,928
Already Attica Ohio.

497
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,744
I can hear the stress in your voices and at your retina

498
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Falling down and scraping the

499
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Performance

500
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Stroke

501
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,520
It's not

502
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Under

503
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
The rules code regulation

504
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
Virtual contract

505
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,232
Because it's powered

506
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Beat the land

507
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
You are

508
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
My ancestors

509
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
Talking too fast

510
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:55,072
Makes me think you might be staying at all

511
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
There

512
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,400
Care about her family

513
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,960
Close to

514
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Espousing

515
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,824
Sovereign citizen freeman-on-the-land kind of

516
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
But never wants to

517
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
To use those words

518
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,088
Have you noticed any would look like an idiot if you overtly came out

519
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Absolutely

520
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,720
So

521
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Send to it

522
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,888
Tell me more about your ancestor was an aide-de-camp to Washington

523
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:36,288
While of course

524
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
Okay so first of all

525
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,872
Give me advice

526
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
We have very firm evidence he's like

527
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,832
Exactly what I said thank you for cutting through this whole illegal immigrant

528
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:53,440
Which is the problem for him trying to take some sort of position

529
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Play like he wasn't

530
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
The second thing that clearly damaged

531
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
Straight to the

532
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
Uses words like

533
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Illegal alien

534
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
And some stuff like that

535
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
His audience knows exactly what

536
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
This caller is fully demonstrated

537
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
She heard Mexican when he said that

538
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
Because that's what you meant

539
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,896
Responding the way you described

540
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
Shows

541
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Me to get that one

542
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
AR stock

543
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
They're not free

544
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Because

545
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,048
Birth certificate they have social

546
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Security numbers letters everywhere around the flag

547
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
This is the beginning of a trend on the Zephyr

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,104
Episodes that I haven't seen before that make me

549
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
And it's quite frankly a bunch

550
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
People

551
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
Expressing

552
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
A bit of bitterness but also

553
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
Jealousy of illegal immigrants

554
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Undertale

555
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Create the perception

556
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,488
There's a free one

557
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
A tween

558
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,096
The noble white Sovereign citizens are the ones who are oppressed

559
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,680
It's hard it's hard to look at

560
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:10,240
Illegally to another country

561
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
You can do that

562
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
Touch our country

563
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
So we'll get back to that.

564
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,528
The theme that runs through

565
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
But Alex

566
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,088
Distracted

567
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Back to this

568
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
I said something

569
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Tell me what you want to say it's bad

570
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
It's just bad

571
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,424
Speech issue article Fox News

572
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,856
The word negro racial slur

573
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Because what he is trying to say

574
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Is that negro mean

575
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Black

576
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,656
Spanish

577
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Black Spanish

578
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,080
And what he accidentally says is not

579
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
Negro Blanco

580
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
Negro Anglo

581
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,760
So Alex

582
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
Hey hey hey hey

583
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Didn't mean thing

584
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Brave

585
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Okay

586
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,168
In Europe

594
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,352
And then it came out

595
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,656
And so that original

596
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,728
Piece of information

597
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592

Classify the word retarded as inoffensive

601
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560

00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Picture of

6 million diet ask

628
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
We know it was in the millions but not just

629
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Because the Soviets

630
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,248

631
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832

639
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
This idea that this guy Robin page

641
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,384
Guarantee that

642
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,688

Correct this time

648
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,184
Guy is a sort of vague

649
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976

Sign language

663
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
This guy

664
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,776
The trouble that he got in was because he gave the speech

665
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Restart

666
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,736

Complained about was this a GF

671
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
I'm trying to incite hatred

672
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Towards these

673
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,472

677
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,224
From this article in the telegraph

678
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Express any concern

679
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,272
Time but a letter

680
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Complaint was received later by the

681
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,112
The police and another person wrote to say

682
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
He disagreed with the remark

683
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,768
Robin and a further five months later was contacted at his farm

684
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,096
In Cambridgeshire and that's by two officers from gloucestershire

685
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
Interview

686
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
I ended up

687
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
Overnight

It was

691
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
It's like trying to

692
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
Incite racial hatred

693
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
Little ambitious little

694
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Capricious of the police will have you

695
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,808
And in the end he was exonerated

696
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,136
He got $2,000 for his trouble

697
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928

698
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,792

County Jail

701
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,776
He did end up getting fired from his

00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:40,800
Host

703
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
Later

704
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
News article

705
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,600
You found himself in hot water of a quote

706
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
Joke about giving contraceptives to immigrants in raisins

707
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,768
While a local liberal Democrat

708
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
We complain

709
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,304
Do the charities

Through

713
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
So

714
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,312
There's been other racism

715
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Because that's

716
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,152
How a bad word

717
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Nicole

718
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:22,272
Cuckoo it's this guy has a pretty good track record of minimizing

719
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
Experiences

720
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
Non-white

721
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,856
Traditional farmers

722
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,648
And then also

723
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,952
Advocated for

724
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,584
Drug of the Moon all the time

725
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,776
Look in our world

726
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
That was very tame

727
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Racist

728
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,992
People are very polite

729
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
Narwhal

730
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
The feeling of like

731
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
This isn't going to

732
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
He just

733
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
You just said that he wants to give immigrants

734
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,216
Contraceptives

735
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,360
That's Bush League that's horrible

736
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,176
Assuming sexual assault

737
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,504
Like it's an old white dude

738
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,488
Bombshell about

739
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
He is

740
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,376
Done a little about how he is jealous of

741
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
Because

742
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
Did you do a number one or number two

743
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
One who is wiping

744
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm not sure

745
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,616
Holocaust

746
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Revision

747
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Apology

748
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,503
In a conversation defending the r word

749
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
I guess

750
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,391
Just to get Bingo on the scorecard for April 1st

751
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,999
He's got to have an interview with someone who thinks you don't have to pay taxes

752
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
How much are car is great to have you here with us

753
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,983
Thanks Leon I'm always glad to be here

754
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:22,847
So do you think the Tommy Cryer beat the IRS existed

755
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,127
This is very similar to

756
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
The last guy who

757
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
Quote

758
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
PIRA

759
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
What which guy was wasn't that a Project Camelot episode where they

760
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
The government

761
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Meet 300,000

762
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
They always win

763
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
Actually technically win

764
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
Thought his case

765
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Criminal case

766
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,895
And that was because

767
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
In order for him to be convicted of this crime

768
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
They had to be convinced

769
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:04,063
That he believed he had to pay taxes

770
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,623
It was willingly not doing that

771
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
He was able to prove in court or convince this journey that he actually didn't believe

772
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,071
They let him go

773
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
On a technicality

774
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:23,519
It doesn't reach the criminal statute

775
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,847
So now this is interesting.

776
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Pacifica

777
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
You should know that

778
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
This episode is on April 1st

779
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
2000

780
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,111
Tommy Cryer got back up in the irs's

781
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,951
A file to court something

782
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,487
The US Tax Court

783
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
He was trying to say that

784
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
You didn't

785
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,863
1.7 million dollars in taxes

786
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
From the years 1990

787
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,727
83 through 2001 that the IRS

788
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Hey buddy

789
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
Yo that vine

790
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,823
Yeah they good day after this interview

791
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:03,455
He doesn't steal and on top of the world

792
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Buckeye believes me

793
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
I'm going to go ahead and f*** with you

794
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Convicted of criminal.

795
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
Bees puns

796
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,815
And tons of

797
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Unpaid

798
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
He's filed its petition

799
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
And he said that there's a little bit of a discrepancy

800
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,799
The amount of the claim deficiency is

801
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
Disputed the correct amount

802
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
What is $0

803
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,527
No that's not true

804
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Hey what time you cry or did was

805
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Trying to get

806
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
Date delayed

807
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
Sweet kept pushing

808
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Court date

809
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
And finally

810
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
12

811
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,055
The court granted him another delay

812
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
All the way up to that point

813
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,527
2009

814
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,599
From early 2011

815
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,207
He was sort of going through like a petty I'll mail you a letter or tell you you're wrong

816
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,791
Kind of thing until little bit later

817
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,863
Baby a year-and-a-half

818
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,679
These delays

819
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,751
You got a delay and they rescheduled

820
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
October 22nd

821
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
2012

822
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
That never happened

823
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Because Tommy Cryer died on the

824
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:42,783
4th of June 2012

825
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,695
I don't know I'm not sure about that

826
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,463
Full list

827
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
To use

828
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
In order to move the tape

829
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,559
Court case

830
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
I don't know all that stuff

831
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
I don't know all that stuff but I do know

832
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
Only got off on

833
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Going to prison

834
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Because the courts

835
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
Jersey

836
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Yogi believes it

837
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,663
Having

838
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
Bruschetta prison for that

839
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
I guess

840
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Avenue

841
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Push it back over and over and over and over

842
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
Feel like I remember

843
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Think about laws

844
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:21,951
Not being a dick

845
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
I don't know where the line is but yeah

846
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
That might just be an ass

847
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
Ignorance of the law is no defense

848
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,911
Whatever

849
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,959
Possession is 9/10 of the law

850
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,799
This is my advice to everyone always go for a jury

851
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
It is all white and your black ass

852
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
Don't go

853
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
Episode we talked about how robbed

854
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:54,719
Other guy were down in Sacramento trying to get

855
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,351
Camp this

856
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
That sort of that sort of thing

857
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Yu-Gi-Oh he's

858
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
Rob Rob

859
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Come in here

860
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Is that Alex

861
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
Keep saying that

862
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,975
He's filming this for his new documentary

863
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Multiple times

864
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Caesars like

865
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Say that again

866
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:43,103
You know you're still doing the radio show here I know you want this documentary to shine but do this

867
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,503
This camera this time

868
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:54,367
Move your eyes we're going to give you a leading question

869
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Use more or less doing

870
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,743
Is Rob.

871
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
Really reinforces my

872
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
But this story

873
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
Appeal to Infowars

874
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
Tony racial basis

875
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
That we've heard so much of

876
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:22,015
Imagine that

877
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,063
Loans

878
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,695
We didn't we did notice Hispanics in the sentence

879
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,303
Hispanic there's a couple

880
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,471
Illegal aliens around we actually didn't seem too many in that area

881
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,055
At all

882
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:05,791
These illegal immigrants we've already established Alex believe means Mexican they know they're doing

883
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
They are the game the system

884
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:13,471
All these houses and riding around in these awesome cars

885
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,031
Who's the coolest

886
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,567
Is this

887
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,359
Is it like the scene from Heat

888
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
Where's Lex

889
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
You know what

890
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
Outside

891
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
I were so no ice

892
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,647
You do it but I respect you know I don't think so I think it's

893
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,463
Beautiful reality in order to Foster

894
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
Feelings of jealousy and

895
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,583
Anger towards minorities

896
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
Yes

897
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Probably the best way to put

898
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,959
That is

899
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,263
That is exactly what that is and of course

900
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Narrative

901
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,687
Oh yeah

902
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
April 1st

903
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
Got some breaking news on some of the gross things

904
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,815
Rising back and forth

905
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,887
They are devaluing the dollar

906
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:20,287
Global Currency

907
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,407
Who's at the news is admitting you should buy gold stocks

908
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
Credible

909
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,159
Get that gold gone

910
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,463
When's the first

911
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
I feel like that sure was

912
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
Looking like looking back on it I felt like

913
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
There was so much

914
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Alex started

915
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
New comedy with

916
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:54,079
The queen stuff like that

917
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
Truth and comedy

918
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
Adele close

919
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
Try to talk about something funny

920
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,879
Giraffe

921
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,671
Amanda's tax protest

922
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
A guy is just a

923
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,231
0

924
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:15,583
About slick I've not heard a ton of times when there's been like

925
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Fairly consistent feelings of

926
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Jealousy

927
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
Towards

928
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Immigrant

929
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:25,311
And stuff like that before you wrinkle I don't know where that's coming from

930
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
But it is definitely the same

931
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:33,247
Place the other immigrant narratives

932
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,271
The listening to him

933
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
But I

934
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
I didn't know what to

935
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
To do with it until I was glad

936
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,671
I didn't think there was a ton of

937
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Is what I'm saying

938
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,767
There's just a lot of Gristle

939
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Bill Hicks

940
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:54,239
Maybe he's actually Mort saw newspaper

941
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,383
I feel like

942
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
Could be

943
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
I didn't feel like there was meat there

944
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
But thankfully I feel like as we get to April 2nd

945
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
There's a little bit more meat

946
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
April 2nd

947
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Super excited

948
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
But before we get to that we have to see the trend

949
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,559
Continue from April 1st to April 2nd

950
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,167
Realize that more and more Fox News personalities

951
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,959
Or sounding like him

952
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
F****** pisses him off

953
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:45,695
It's true all we can talk about

954
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,815
New world

955
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:01,311
By admitting I want apologies

956
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,687
Certainly not out of any of those assholes

957
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Turn on the TV

958
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,927
Do apologize

959
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
Alex Jones

960
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:30,239
We just wanted you to get there on your own we didn't want you to feel like the establishment had your back

961
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:36,895
Your voice could not be created it if you felt like anyone supported you so weird

962
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,735
Make you stronger

963
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,599
That sort of thing

964
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,159
Even more of these

965
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Personality

966
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
You take Target at 4

967
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
Starting to sound like me

968
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
Avocado

969
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,599
I accidentally got too involved in the late nineties when I had nothing

970
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
Just talks about how

971
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
You've got a sense

972
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
What's to come

973
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,895
Martial law

974
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,367
With physical Force

975
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:58,559
We bust our butts to expose the terrorists program

976
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Didn't happen

977
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,863
Must have busted your butt

978
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,167
They must've really busted their ass for real

979
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,983
Also I always love it when I hear Alex Bay

980
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,287
It hit me like a ton of bricks last night

981
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,127
This thing I say all the time

982
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
It was a tsunami of information

983
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:23,391
That would be like me getting on the show be like Jordan

984
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,439
I need to tell you last night I had a

985
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
Breakthrough

986
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Alex Jones

987
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,535
Is that cool

988
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,143
Holyshit sky

989
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
Is if we bust our butts

990
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
I'm trying

991
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Alex

992
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Is not

993
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,359
The level man I didn't realize realize

994
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,431
This guy's got here will you know when I woke up the other day

995
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
I was just

996
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Blown Away

997
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,807
I don't think this shaded gold salesman is on the up-and-up

998
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
No

999
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
No Doubt

1000
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,623
3 years later

1001
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Figuring that out

1002
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
State of Minnesota figure that s*** out

1003
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
They are the

1004
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,071
The state of Minnesota is correct

1005
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
So

1006
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
I told you I found

1007
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Real juice

1008
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Real good

1009
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Richard Nixon

1010
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,751
Was that

1011
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Pink

1012
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,895
Cuz you're going to hear the content of the clip

1013
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Talk about

1014
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,015
It's not how I'm going to flex on this year

1015
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,391
I have talked to multiple Hollywood people in Austin

1016
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,231
Crazywise

1017
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,071
I remember 10 years ago on Erlanger

1018
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
Pleasure

1019
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,343
People thought I was crazy

1020
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:05,023
Play believer

1021
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:14,239
Animals

1022
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
They secretly

1023
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,103
Who am I

1024
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:24,991
I want I was listen to figure out what it was

1025
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Just be the p

1026
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
Got2b

1027
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:35,231
Oouu in Hollywood who's a member of PETA

1028
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
No

1029
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,047
God damn it I mean

1030
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,119
Something I don't know what to go on Alex's totally right

1031
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
They do sacrifice

1032
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,055
Something from the center

1033
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Commercial

1034
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Consumer research

1035
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
It's interesting

1036
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Remix

1037
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
I'm about this report about Pete

1038
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Consumer research

1039
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
Because it doesn't

1040
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
It comes from the center for consumer

1041
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
Freedom

1042
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,439
One simple instant of Alex

1043
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,231
Speaking but I don't think it is

1044
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
For a number of reasons

1045
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
The first is at the center for

1046
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
Consumer research is a real thing

1047
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,143
That's a legitimate

1048
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
It's run out of UC Davis

1049
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:23,103
Consumer attitudes towards food safety and they follow academic guidelines with their work

1050
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Professional Outlet

1051
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,967
The story about Peter with that organization lens

1052
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
Is it credibility

1053
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
On the other hand

1054
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
The center for Consumer freedom

1055
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:35,391
Is it comes from

1056
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Full source

1057
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,047
The center for Consumer freedom is not a research Outlet

1058
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
It's a front group for a lobbyist

1059
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,447
Bourbon is known in many circles as the quote AstroTurf

1060
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
Because the way he does business is

1061
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,311
Turn the front groups to create The False Image

1062
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
Support for various things he's loving

1063
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
Make it look like you're coming

1064
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
From the Grassroots

1065
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,783
As opposed to the actual giant corporate clients who pay his bill

1066
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
Literally creating

1067
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
Page

1068
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
Interesting

1069
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
Chiasso

1070
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,975
Even told his corporate client

1071
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:17,375
Quote we run all of this stuff for nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors

1072
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
There's total anonymity

1073
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,959
People who don't know who supports us

1074
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,543
We've been doing this for 20-something years in this regard

1075
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,591
Answer the degrees to anyone

1076
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
Is concerned about that I will tell you

1077
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,199
There are all sorts of ways

1078
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
The firewalls that have been established

1079
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,527
To get this done on an anonymous basis

1080
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,623
I'm religious about not allowing company names to ever get used

1081
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,927
At least I'm not going to allow them to get

1082
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:46,303
Get used and I don't want companies to ever admit that because it does give the other side at wait

1083
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
To diminish our

1084
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,911
18 literally a James Bond villain

1085
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:58,335
He thought speech

1086
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
There's no problem

1087
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,135
No one will ever know what hahaha

1088
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,207
Plant

1089
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Search business owners

1090
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
Does make them

1091
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,607
Feel like okay well we're never going to get

1092
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,655
That's one of the things you have

1093
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,935
Assure them if you want

1094
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Get them

1095
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,495
Give you that dirty ass money

1096
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
You guys want to do so

1097
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Guess what

1098
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,359
No one's going to know about if you give your buddy

1099
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
Original group was called the guest choice

1100
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
Gucci specifically started

1101
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
To create the appearance

1102
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:41,855
He was representing Restaurant Group

1103
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,695
When in reality he was working for Philip Morris to buy

1104
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,167
What is well

1105
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:01,311
Communications Philip Morris's program manager for public affairs Barber

1106
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
Clearly laid out his strategy

1107
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,431
If externally perceived is driven by restaurant

1108
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:11,295
There'll be more flexibility allowed benefits by Philip Morris

1109
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:15,647
9 months after their founding Philip Morris attorney bharti Berrington Road

1110
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,279
USA is still the only contributor

1111
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,607
The promise others

1112
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
They were the sole people behind

1113
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Philip Morris

1114
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
Tobacco

1115
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,799
Maurice gave Birdman over $600,000 that year.

1116
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,079
Grassroots opposition to the

1117
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
He doesn't have a ton of Indus

1118
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,479
He organized the employment policies Institute to attack unions

1119
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,503
Initiatives to raise the

1120
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Minimum wage

1121
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,831
But it's funded by money from the restaurant and hotel in

1122
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
He organized the American Beverage

1123
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
The fight against drunk driving laws

1124
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,255
Which predictably is financed by the alcohol

1125
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
This is all Rick Berman does

1126
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
He creates organization

1127
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
Official sounding names

1128
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
To serve the interest

1129
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
A big business

1130
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
That is it

1131
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
Can scam you got to give it to

1132
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Great

1133
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,335
The millions of dollars

1134
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
It doesn't seem like

1135
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,015
I mean you got to create a shell company

1136
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,879
Relationship

1137
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
Creating your own University degree

1138
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,815
With the lawyer

1139
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,863
No no no no no

1140
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
In this case if you do it wrong you're going to prison

1141
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,727
Right

1142
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,519
But you don't need someone else

1143
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
To help you

1144
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Make a fake diploma

1145
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
Do that on your own

1146
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
In this case you need

1147
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,247
Other countries

1148
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
In 2002 the guest Choice Network renamed itself the center for Consumer freedom and a lot of its focus

1149
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Safety organizations

1150
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,839
It's a surprise no one that the list of donors included hundreds of thousands of dollars

1151
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,887
From Monsanto Cargill in Tysons

1152
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,239
Food it should also surprised no one that they received over $100,000

1153
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
From the coke like foundations

1154
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
The donors trust donors Capital fund

1155
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,407
As well as over $600,000 from the Bradley

1156
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,991
The foundation was founded by Harry Bradley

1157
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:23,391
Who interesting Lee was a founding member of the John Birch Society along with Fred Koch father of Charles and

1158
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
Because Brothers

1159
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,535
These are very startling connections but leaving those aside the reason

1160
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,071
For Center forever

1161
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Consumer freedom

1162
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
To attack Peter is very clear

1163
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,447
Outcry about factory farming

1164
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
4 years

1165
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
Any particular was

1166
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Huge Target

1167
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,543
Rid of Tyson Food

1168
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,103
Whose cruelty been exposed by Peter multiple time

1169
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,151
This is the perfect articulation of his

1170
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Strategy

1171
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,735
2007 interview with 60 minutes

1172
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Where you said that it is

1173
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
Approach to shoot the messenger

1174
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,831
Instead of addressing

1175
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:56,927
Disgusting animal cruelty conversation into attacking

1176
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
Bwahahaha

1177
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,255
Every single f****** sense

1178
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
He said it should end with

1179
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,071
Wahahaha

1180
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
You f****** Super Bowl

1181
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,935
Story about Peta killing animals

1182
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,751
Particularly

1183
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Evil organization

1184
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,335
Valid criticism

1185
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Cat makeup

1186
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
Capito another places

1187
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,503
The reason the numbers that they sent a consumer

1188
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
More freedom is able to

1189
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,575
Bestop birth animals

1190
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,391
Peter killed the reason that it's so high that year

1191
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
Is it they were called

1192
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
Policeman in North Carolina

1193
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
The ton of animals were being

1194
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
And killed at shelters

1195
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
There but it's very inhumane ways

1196
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,215
For instance being Gaston metal boxes or shot with 22 handgun

1197
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,335
Peta came and assess the situation and provided more Humane euthanasia methods

1198
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
At no cost

1199
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,895
They assessed the alternative

1200
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
Handling the animals creating an actuary

1201
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,783
The only viable option

1202
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
For most of the animals

1203
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,111
We're sick neglected

1204
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
Read severe aggression

1205
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Problems

1206
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,975
I would love to live in a world where no animals were put to sleep

1207
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
But I also recognize this

1208
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Severe over

1209
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,815
Population problem for dogs

1210
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,839
Cattleman's country

1211
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,143
Now I'm miserable sick animals life would be

1212
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,239
One of those places

1213
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
Shot in the head

1214
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:21,663
I'm not thrilled with animals or anything like that but I'm also not to do

1215
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
Like

1216
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,015
Closed-minded or short-sighted to think that it's intrinsic

1217
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
When you haven't

1218
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
Situation where it's like

1219
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,855
There is nothing

1220
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Can do to help

1221
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Hannibal that's going to live in

1222
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
Yeah that's

1223
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:39,583
This is reality in that article put out

1224
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
Consumer freedom

1225
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
It's clear what

1226
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
Rick Berman is paid

1227
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
DeSantis corporate clients

1228
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,727
You don't want to have to

1229
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
Pabor to do their dirty business

1230
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,591
Peta makes it difficult for his big food client

1231
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
To keep abusing animals

1232
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,735
To keep overhead love you being paid big bucks to Target them with propaganda

1233
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
No nuance

1234
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,415
Alex Jones is literally passing off Pro corporate interest propaganda is research on his show

1235
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
The fact that he says

1236
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Visit from the center

1237
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
A consumer research

1238
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,303
Leads me to suspect that he was trying to muddy the waters

1239
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
And make it more difficult for his listeners

1240
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,399
To realize that what he was doing

1241
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,959
Was repurposing corporate propaganda

1242
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
On his show

1243
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
I expect that

1244
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
I can't prove it

1245
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
You know

1246
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,383
There is a world that exists where he just misspoke

1247
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Incidentally

1248
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
It doesn't

1249
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Wasn't

1250
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,087
To cover up the idea that this is information that's coming out of a

1251
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Barely

1252
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,159
Easy to get to the bottom of

1253
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:39,743
Corporate shill

1254
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
Yeah that's clearly not a real thing

1255
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
So I'll just say the real thing

1256
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:52,799
Yeah so is listeners are left in the dark now for the fun

1257
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,871
A little part it should be noted

1258
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
Four things that Alex is absolutely ago

1259
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,759
In addition to having taken their money in 20s

1260
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
16 that you worked as a

1261
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
Consultant for Monsanto

1262
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,391
Specifically about how to make your GMOs more appealing

1263
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
To the public

1264
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,767
So he's like he's like that one we talked about

1265
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
Propaganda

1266
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,607
F****** soldier-of-fortune

1267
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Like he just

1268
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:22,495
Maybe we should

1269
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,311
Concerta Consulting Group will come up with propaganda

1270
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,615
I will just have all this s*** for like

1271
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Sopita

1272
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,455
Disclose their donors

1273
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
And then we'll put

1274
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:39,903
I feel like that's not the plan that I really know

1275
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,183
Nevermind

1276
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,463
I'm going to back away for

1277
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,279
Alex is doing this

1278
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Anywhere

1279
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Elpida isn't

1280
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Use against

1281
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
I guess

1282
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
I'm not sure why

1283
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:56,799
I guess that's the only thing I can see

1284
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:01,663
Did you just look at them external associate them with more less

1285
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,503
I guess but I don't know exactly why he's

1286
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Queer

1287
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,879
Example of

1288
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Affront

1289
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
4

1290
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Corporate propaganda

1291
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
That's funded by

1292
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
The Koch brothers

1293
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Monsanto

1294
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,071
Tyson Foods

1295
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
And

1296
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Foundation do

1297
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,191
Who founded by

1298
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:30,591
Friends with Fred Coqui burger and was a founding member of the John Birch Society

1299
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
All of this together it's

1300
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
Very

1301
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,759
It just keeps coming up doesn't weird

1302
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:43,135
Weird

1303
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
I don't think they're good people

1304
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,279
No they're not they're actually bad

1305
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
People like

1306
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:56,191
Like not but not level

1307
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
They're almost a shadow

1308
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
Ball of

1309
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,847
I wonder if

1310
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,407
Discord info

1311
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
Foment

1312
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
Muddy Waters

1313
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
And destroy

1314
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,831
And make impotent

1315
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
True social change

1316
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:18,463
I know baby that's the conclusion the stock has will eventually come to you

1317
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,375
Corporatist

1318
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,191
We're just talking about stealing

1319
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,983
There's no

1320
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
There's no larger picture to it

1321
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Necessarily

1322
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,639
What we can we can say for sure is it looks like these are real bad

1323
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:40,479
People people that

1324
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
They're not nearly as bad

1325
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
Is everyone who works at

1326
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,183
They pressured

1327
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
He's been to parties

1328
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
What are you not cool

1329
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,431
I guess

1330
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,247
Haven't gotten invited

1331
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:22,207
Like a day after they're all I know

1332
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
Alex

1333
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
Make a call here

1334
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
This takes us back

1335
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
April 1st a little bit with some

1336
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Comfy like

1337
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,031
Go back to Tom Tom

1338
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,151
Yeah I think you made a really good point about the illegal alien

1339
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,943
Earlier in the show about how

1340
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
That they

1341
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,759
They are truly free

1342
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Innocence that

1343
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,575
You know they have

1344

Tower family structures

1345
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:55,999
I think Tom is listening to show on a day delay or something like that you must be listening to yesterday

1346
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Sorry

1347
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,303
And they're rejecting

1348
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:04,703
These are mechanisms of control that that the American people that the citizens of the United States of America open the Excel

1349
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495

Even under Obama

1355
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
Actually especially

1356
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,351
We increase

1357
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
The number for

1358
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,471
Black mark Autobahn

1359
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,311
It's demonstrable enochtrue what he saying

1360
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,527
Given credit for the things that we judge

1361
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,063
Like people who are

1362
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Ostensibly closer

1363
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,951
To being on his side

1364
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
I hate him for everything but at least we got rid of a lot of

1365
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Implicit division

1366
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,775

01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Isn't it

1370
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
Clearly a racial division

1371
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,247
That is what you talkin about other terminology

1372
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
Very very

1373
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:27,135
So frustrating because it looked the reality is

1374
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,439
With all the

1375
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,511
Staggering about but if at the end

1376
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
His presidency

1377
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815

01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,639
The scales are think yeah

1385
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,943
Obama's

1386
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
Right right

1387
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Deportation

1388
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415
May I agree

1389
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
Things that are good

1390
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
You can't help

1391
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
Has been talkin about

1392
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
You'll recall

1393
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Popular Mechanics

1394
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Get out

1395
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Set this next Monday

1396
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,287
He's going to

1397
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,431
The internet rumors that are going around

1398
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,735
So immediately Alex's

1399
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Response was

1400
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,831
Preemptively debunk is debunking

1401
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,391
Because I know what he's going to say

1402
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,975
Yeah I'm going to get ahead of the game

1403
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
He keeps saying he's going to do it

1404
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,071
I will get down to the wire now

1405
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,631
And in this next clip he realizes

1406
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
He still hasn't done that yet

1407
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,751
And he needs to do it because he said he's going to do it preemptively

1408
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
And there's less

1409
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
Power if you put it out

1410
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:49,567
After the fact

1411
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
Course because he's not psychic

1412
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,687
What are meeting about how we got to get to work done

1413
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:04,415
Do it

1414
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:08,255

1415
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:23,615
Ever had an offer production ever

1416
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,271

1418
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,871

01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,807
This implies that they never have

1421
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,191

Expose him

1427
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447

01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:13,951
Fishing trips going to have to wait kids sorry about that

1434
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,791
Hilarious bomber

1435
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
I have to hate Glenn Beck

1436
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
We listen to the

1437
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,111
Wow

1438
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
If it's any consolation

1439
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,583
I'm not going to do that work actually

1440
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,799
An Irish coffee

1441
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,823
We can't go fishing

1442
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,639
That's good fun

1443
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,711

Deception

1450
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Hang up on it

This guy calls into Alex show

Sean Hannity Show for plug

1457
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Alex's

1458
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,175
Alex has a very interesting take on it

1459
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
That he would never say

1460
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
Right

1461
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,439
Delayed because

1462
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
Call Danette Deadpool at the liberal-left

Left left

1465

Maintain control

1466
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
As soon as soon as I heard myself come live on the show

1467
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
Radio

1468
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
Trinity.

1469
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Start the next caller so I didn't

1470
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
No one got really got to hear it

1471
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:33,471
Sean Hannity

1472
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
YouTube correctly octopus

1473
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:47,295
Imagine the Sean Hannity

1474
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
Start a website in Westport on it became incredibly popular they were

1475
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
Probably one of the most popular

1476
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,959
Politics in order to get

1477
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,751
But that's not

1478
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,311
Texas Giant message board

1479
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079

Lion Air

1481
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Clearly

1482
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:18,527
Do you have the right to kick people off that message board

1483
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,111
Alex

1484
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,927
He does think that the government is directing Google to do it

1485
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,743
But I honestly think

1486
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,303
That is just his way of getting around this

1487
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:34,655
Like a champ you know I don't I don't take this call 100%

1488
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,423
Does Wales like

Well in order for this to appear to be sent

1490
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,055
I must believe the government is secretly behind.

1491
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
2009

1492
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431

01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
I got to call my wife

1533
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,896
And tell her to tell the kids I'm not going

1534
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
Play Mackenzie realizes he's got to get ahead of it

1535
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,976
Time goes by

1536
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
He has.

1537
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Another little block a call

1538
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,864
Dismiss call witch

1539
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
I really think

1540
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,704
I know we don't play too many calls

1541
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,240
He is on the show

1542
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,800
Just a couple Clips backwards

1543
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,336
Jealous of the

1544
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
Illegal immigrants Ohio

1545
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,832
George Washington

1546
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Haha

1547
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,000
I think we do a pretty good job of giving across back

1548
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,792
Section of Alex's College

1549
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,704
Gemstone better kind of boring

1550
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
Certainly.

1551
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Not worth

1552
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,312
Looking at or anything like that or not unfair at all

1553
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,944
This next clip if I only played this it would be unfair

1554
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,136
If I played Just

1555
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
This call

1556
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,720
It would be painting the picture that all of Alex Jones

1557
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
The callers are

1558
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Totally crazy

1559
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
At the same

1560
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Time

1561
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,632
This call is not far out of the Main Street

1562
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,448
Super unfair with me

1563
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,240
Just play calls like this

1564
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
But this is business.

1565
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,128
Let's go ahead and talk to Maureen and Virginia you're on the air

1566

Scary

1575
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
We need to remember

1576
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
We serve the most

1577
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
Most high God

1578
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,256
These other idiots

1579
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
Exerting

1580
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,072
He only took

1581
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,888
One-third of the angels with him it's going to be a

1582
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
Two Against One

1583
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,192
Fight

1584
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,224
Pictures of this battle

1585
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,296
Who won at the Alamo

1586
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Since You Beyonce

1587
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
We have

1588
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,768
Partner

1589
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
10 cm

1590
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,584
Eclipse

1591
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
Studio

1592
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:04,896
It's the same thing as in that interview with Rob

1593
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,712
Stuff like that

1594
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,760
George Humphreys

1595
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:16,160
Cold Asian people Oriental Ono

1596
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
You quotes Friday Night Lights

1597
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:22,048
The Open Heart

1598
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,168
Listen I'll tell you this right now

1599
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,496
State and got out of there and he had

1600
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,848
Still did it

1601
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,408
6440

1602
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Clear Eyes

1603
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Demonheart

1604
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:47,392
Doesn't matter if you're white black Oriental clear a code

1605
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
Stuff from the apartment

1606
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,632
As I was listening to it I was just

1607
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
Like it was all just

1608
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,960
He said

1609
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
It doesn't give me much hope

1610
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
The new film

1611
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
Groundbreaking

1612
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,640
The same thing

1613
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,480
I understand correctly

1614
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
George Humphrey interviews

1615
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:19,648
For this new documentary also in the original movie

1616
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:23,744
Go to Sacramento to

1617
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
Write about a homeless encampment

1618
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:31,680
Evil Dead 2 worth basically a remake

1619
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,960
The first documentary

1620
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
I suspect

1621
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,776
I haven't watched it yet

1622
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Quality

1623
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
I don't

1624
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,016
You know why because I mean compared to

1625
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:50,624
I don't think it will be because

1626
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,928
We're going to try this one more

1627
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:59,584
Lester

1628
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
Footage

1629
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:08,032
The Blair Witch

1630
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,920
Billy try to f*** with Glenn Beck

1631
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:21,344
Oh man how great would it be if his kids had already cancelled on him going fishing

1632
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,648
Create this whole psychodrama

1633
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,744
I was trying to find a way to turn

1634
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,536
Extinct

1635
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:36,448
They've sold their fishing rod by him the proof Glenn Beck's a liar

1636
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
I don't know

1637
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
Shards of magic

1638
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:48,224
Interesting I think this episode is

1639
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,856
Oversold

1640
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
Cirrhosis

1641
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,488
Protesters

1642
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,048
Receive the friends of fox

1643
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,584
Becoming more like him

1644
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,864
You getting f******

1645
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,888
Pissed off

1646
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,168
Glenn Beck

1647
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,960
Because that works that's

1648
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,312
Talked about him in the past about how he's a snake in the grass and I'll do that

1649
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
Sean Hannity

1650
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:19,712
All these people coming and being

1651
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
Two similar to

1652
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:25,600
They're exploiting by Revenue Street

1653
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:31,488
The clear evidence that he's just sort of funneling corporate propaganda

1654
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,256
Botanica come

1655
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,280
From somewhere else

1656
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
Tickles me to no end

1657
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
Deezer

1658
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,472
Like surprising and

1659
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,776
When you think about it incredibly obvious

1660
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
He would notice before

1661
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,616
The rest of the car

1662
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,688
Realize that Fox News was becoming info

1663
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,552
Steven wanted

1664
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
Is revenue the rest of us

1665
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Crazy

1666
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
We didn't realize that they were

1667
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
Taking their first step along

1668
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,536
Dabney

1669
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:13,216
It is like one of the only insightful moments

1670
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,544
We'll see we'll see how this all works out I am very

1671
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,616
Most liked a lot of this being about the queen

1672
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
How she shed

1673
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:26,784
Call Larry Nichols confirmed

1674
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,880
I'd rather not too late

1675
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,184

2009 April

1679
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376

Kohl's

1686
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:08,000
But

1687
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,048
If there was a giant message board

1688
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,608
That was an alligator stew the one that Sean Hannity

1689
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
Kitty created

1690
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,936
Analogy

1691
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,496
We are on

Next time

1695
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
I would like

1696
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,696
Lauren from Ohio hasn't killed anybody

1697
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,792
You killed somebody

1698
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,632
The clear on murder

1699
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:51,520
Look messed up you have no evidence that she's ever killed anybody and irresponsible accusation

1700
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,336
So at this point any further Evidence

1701
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,384
Lauren from Ohio

1702
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,688
Technically probably has

1703
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
That's out

1704
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:08,416
Alexandra Thurston color my huge fan I love your work
