1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Around

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
What about Alex Jones

7
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,912
Jordan Jordan

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Unprecedented

10
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,568
Did Jordan my breakbot in the same thing it was last episode

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
But I finished it

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
OU finished and I had her back in the cartoon again

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
No I I watched all the Amazon original series cuz I couldn't stop

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Everybody

15
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Is just great and it all the characters are great

16
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
John Hodgman

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
In the second season

18
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Freight

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Yeah that was rhyme

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,568
Going to be a small roller

21
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,712
I know that there's a lot of other things we need to complain about Amazon and Bezos about

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Obviously

23
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
This doesn't rank really high

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
The terms of other complaints

25
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
You know

26
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:09,024
I did unionization squashing you're sure it's a lot of problems of Amazon

27
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,376
Maybe not having a secret

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
Is right up there maybe 48 it's like how Alex

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,872
Complaints about the robots of the grocery store is I can

30
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
It's the bag of your own groceries of media consumption

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
I make sense

32
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
What about you

33
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,744
I will announce this now

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
Very excited I will be making a return to Stand-Up post covid

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,960
Whoa that's true I was for my first stand-up

36
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,336
During the time that covid was like really

37
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,224
You do look pretty vaccinations coming around I didn't want to do it and I couldn't

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
People in that City I thought that was a really responsible choice on your part

39
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Now it is in October

40
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
And it was booked by friend of the show Matt drift

41
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,608
Play there a lot of people in the higher Q rating than to get through

42
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm excited to announce that here

43
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,336
I feel like there was some open questions about whether or not you even were going to continue pursuing

44
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
People being interested in by requesting

45
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,088
Basically South before the pandemic

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Nazi if I want to give it another shot if you still connected with

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
The bad kind of expression

48
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,376
See if I still get the feeling so it's always fun to do one of the shows the draft ebooks to

49
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Although

50
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
You probably have to go to the Burger will probably have to go to the bank

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,664
Yep I'll come with you I will be there as well

52
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
Not performing that I will I will be there

53
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
Nice to see you

54
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Baby nice to take over the entire show and

55
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
And then the rest of the comics are like I don't understand what's happening right now

56
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
None of these people know

57
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
That sucks

58
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Take over anyting

59
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Jordan today we have

60
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,799
A present day episode of The Alex Jones Show just got

61
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
I'm trying to shoot for something a little bit

62
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Different

63
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
I'm trying to

64
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
Take an analytical perspective of even myself and how I engage with the material that we're covering all right and I think

65
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
One of the main problems that I have with the present day

66
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
He's sometimes I try to bite off more than I can

67
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
Can chew that I mean cover in more than one day at a time

68
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
I think that the really hard in the present day because Alex is mood is never the same days in a row

69
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
You expect him to cover one piece of news

70
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
Yeah but he was really big on a Monday

71
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
He probably is going to forget about it by Tuesday

72
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,711
We're all going to be dead on Tuesday Wednesday we're winning

73
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Cheapest just

74
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Incoherent to the point where

75
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
Painful for me to try and make it

76
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Palatable to an audience

77
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
And it's frustrating to me to try and talk

78
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
To you about it

79
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:26,655
Well why is he in a better but I don't know

80
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
Could be anything

81
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:33,311
It's like he used to do is serialized show and now he's doing a monster the day kind of feeling

82
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Yeah everything's a bottle episode

83
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
F****** weird

84
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
Think that maybe a better approach to it would be to just look at a day at a

85
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:48,671
Right

86
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,511
So

87
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,863
I sped into the bike that cuz I know you're trying to lull me into a false sense of security

88
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,471
There is there is a metagame currently going on between us

89
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
On June 13th is the as the kids say

90
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Okay

91
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Is wildin out

92
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
He is on fleek

93
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
I disagree with your use of fleek

94
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
But we shall see

95
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
Not sure what it means

96
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
Business on this before we do let's say hello

97
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Oh that's great

98
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
So why first

99
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,191
Rev Dr Robert EO Speedwagon

100
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Call Alisha Adventure saw there's a character

101
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
Call Robert

102
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Speedway

103
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
Whoa

104
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Could be alright

105
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,183

Money off that heroin

112
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
Freakishly large

113
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
It's time to get deep

114
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
Giving someone life is giving someone death

115
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
You can say that

116
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Life is good

117
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879

Look I've got to I've got to leave you hanging out that way it's fair

132
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
One other thing was that Erica send a message

133
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
Special drop played

134
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Why not I think the people are itching

135
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Temprid SC

136
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951

137
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023

00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
Mama shark beat beat beat beat beat

I'll be right back

140
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Always good to hear some daddy shark

141
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
So are we talking about June 13th but here is not a caltex dropped

142
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Today Show

143
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
You know I would never say if I got killed

144
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Start a civil war

145
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Good

146
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Well one

147
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
You would already be dead so you wouldn't have the opportunity beforehand

148
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Deadman switch for a civil war

149
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Austin the meaning is the

150
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
Opposite of the meaning kind of thing I would never say

151
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
The planet when I die I would never say that the only reason you would mean

152
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,295
If you want that to be true

153
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
Almost nobody would say that

154
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Except for maybe Mandela

155
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,023
So Alex has got a piece of news

156
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Is here on the 30

157
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
Papism Sunday show on the 13th you've gotten

158
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
The news that's a this gentleman by the name Christopher sign

159
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
It passed away

160
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
He was a reporter Auntie was the person who is credited with breaking the

161
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Story

162
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
The president and former President Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch

163
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Right arm at CarMax

164
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
And of course

165
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
That means this was annexed

166
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
What is the next thing to come in a season like this

167
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
What is the next move always

168
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
And the movie been tearing all over the world

169
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Well it's this right here

170
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
That's what it is

171
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Forty-five-year-old

172
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Christopher

173
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
Sign

174
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Award-winning

175
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
TV

176
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
We just had a

177
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
I was super happy

178
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Well he got executed inside of his house

179
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
And his body wasn't even cold

180
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
Blood related before they said it was a suicide

181
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Just like Breitbart

182
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Suicidal

183
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Breitbart

184
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Suicide is a heart attack

185
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
They said he did a lot of Coke

186
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,991
The situation with his is the reporting on it is

187
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Treated as a

188
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Respective

189
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,415
People reporting

190
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
Signs of Foul Play

191
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,327
But generally would lead investigators to initially give a

192
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
It looks like a murder

193
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
From the inside like everything I don't know all of the Pacific

194
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
All the details

195
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
You know this is the same thing that Alex does all the time

196
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,527
It's like they're saying that it's suicide in order to make sure that there's a cover-up as opposed to

197
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
There's reporting that it preliminary indications appear to be

198
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
That this

199
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Was the case of

200
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
The cover-up because they're reporting that it's

201
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Not a cover-up

202
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
See

203
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Make sense

204
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,447
Yeah so one of the things to keep a real sharp focus on here is how definitive

205
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,287
Reporting this as an ex

206
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Funeral Home

207
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,383
Funny how that just

208
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,759
Flies over me.

209
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:44,159
That guy was executed with no evidence or thought or anything like that and I'm like well of course he's just

210
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Can I claim that

211
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:50,559
He's the crying that the media is definitively saying that it's suicide when in fact

212
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
The articles that I could find about those were saying that

213
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
It's being handled the investigation

214
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Is presumed to suicide

215
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
Intel other!

216
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
And Alex's doing

217
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
The exact same thing just the office

218
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
He's claiming the media is doing it

219
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
That is jumping to the conclusion of

220
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,855
Knock Lovelace execution for sure because they

221
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
It's almost as if he forgets that there are real people involved in the story

222
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
He doesn't care

223
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
So he also was treating this like a real departure

224
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Trump

225
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
The way things were

226
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Let's say yes

227
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,775
Suicide threats

228
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Clinton

229
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Because he's supposed

230
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,271
They have the judge Department in the FBI all Alabama corrupt

231
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Partially

232
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Well

233
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Been waiting for a green light time

234
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,695
To go offensive

235
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,767
His execution is a message everybody

236
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,119
Check to see a lot of these killings that he was definitely murdered in my view

237
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
So

238
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
This is this is pretty

239
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Definite

240
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,591
But also there's a number of things that he doesn't ever substantiate anyway

241
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
On the show which

242
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Just me the problem

243
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
The first is he doesn't

244
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
Show or give any evidence

245
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Of him saying I will never kill myself

246
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
That's just something that he says

247
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Quesadilla tries to make Muddy

248
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
And then the other thing is he's taking

249
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,071
Can things completely out of context there is an interview that you did on Fox News this Christopher sign

250
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,399
Were you saying that when he did this reporting he was getting

251
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Threat store

252
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
But

253
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
He does not say that they are from the Clinton

254
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,615
There's a hundred different explanation for where these threats could have come from

255
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,687
I mean I guess if you want to jump to a conclusion that like

256
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Bill got on the phone

257
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
I guess you could use that first person I've had a kid

258
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:55,231
I guess you if Alex wants to just make that conclusion job and and take

259
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
The only evidence that he plays or

260
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,887
Is it always this Fox news interview

261
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Proof that the clintons worth retina

262
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
I guess

263
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
You can but he can't prove that what has the Fox news interview

264
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
It was within the last few years

265
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,431
Okay wasn't recent okay so the interview where he's getting

266
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
Threats is from a few years ago

267
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
Also he's saying that it was when the reporting happened and that was 2016 5 years ago

268
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
Fairly certain people that had to have Let It Go

269
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,047
No they just let you forget about it

270
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
I don't know president

271
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
That's true

272
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,983
Because you was partially destroyed by this reporter partially taken down

273
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
So Alex jumps around a little bit

274
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Just throw a few darts

275
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
Surround there's one of them

276
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
Heading out now Mainline doctors sweetly to Mexico

277
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,391
People are seriously magnetic

278
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
And then we find a literature about its design

279
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
To grow magnetic

280
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
Prions in the body

281
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
See apparently Alex is on the magnet tip

282
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Magnetic primer

283
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
In the body

284
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:16,127
Iron in the blood

285
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
Do they inject you first and then they like

286
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,551
Is it like an embryo that grows with inside you and then you give birth to a magnet baby

287
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
I don't know

288
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
I don't know cuz I would doesn't explain and I don't really

289
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Is a little bit

290
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Viral videos of Schubert

291
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Sure

292
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
I got you into it

293
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
To talk more about this it's just a throwaway things I guess

294
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
Active baby I need more information about that

295
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
I was like how small his geography is

296
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Like if this is the

297
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,015
Biggest world in the world from Italy to Mexico

298
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Chirp

299
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
So

300
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
The clintons

301
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Rick Heller

302
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Time is it the beginning of

303
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Because they were waiting

304
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
For the green light or something

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
Do go ahead and take out people who know

306
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
They're dirt

307
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,311
A couple hundred here a couple hundred there's no wait awhile

308
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
You'll see the top of group it is

309
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
Arkansas Savings and Loan

310
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
People that know about their corruption in euros

311
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
The Africa scams and deals

312
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,207
But this is how I believe the first Salvo and I've been predicting this is coming

313
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
What about Larry Nichols

314
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
We don't talk about her that's it pass

315
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:44,191
That was just bring up Larry Nichols at all here like he passed away within the last year

316
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
I swear I

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
I think we're the only people who notice

318
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
I really I really do kind of feel sad about that we talked about it when he died but it is a bummer

319
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
Alex doesn't even bring up

320
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
If this is if you're doing Clinton conspiracies

321
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
You gotta bring up the the Larry nickel

322
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
You got to say like a convenient

323
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:11,327
Now we back up their killings Larry Nichols is no longer with us in waves

324
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
Is the oracle

325
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Hot man

326
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Why would they kill in Waze

327
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Doesn't that make

328
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Lesson

329
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Now you got two ear to kill it

330
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
And then

331
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
The tide go out

332
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Chenab

333
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
And then come back I feel like I

334
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Connected killings in a short. Of time and then along

335
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
Series

336
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Length of quiet time would

337
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
More suggests that it was

338
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
You know it's a sensation instead of like

339
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
And isolated event

340
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,143
Well if you're not on their Trail

341
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,007
Because I think I've got it

342
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,615
So we got another straight Dart here off of the assassination

343
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Narrative

344
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Very bad development

345
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
On that front a federal judge has ruled

346
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
That

347
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Employers can order you

348
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Protective vaccine

349
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
In experimental testing they won

350
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
To have the job

351
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,303
Well I guess they commanded you got to inject cyanide

352
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
My Free Will you can kill yourself

353
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
The point

354
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
How would you get a job

355
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,847
Hospital employees who refused covid-19 vaccine

356
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,223
According to Alex's politics he should not be opposed to employers having the right to make these sorts of Demands

357
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Employees

358
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Right-wing libertarian based on that believes that he should the employer the right to make whatever requirements

359
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
They want and the employees should have the right to

360
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Accept them as a condition of employment or find a job elsewhere

361
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,887
Vaccine requirement is something that hurts a business's ability to attract potential employees

362
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,727
The free market will sort that out according to libertarian ideology

363
00:19:53,983 --> 00:20:00,127
Come on be unfair for everybody else libertarianism is about fairness for me

364
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Call those people

365
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,479
117 employees out of the 26000

366
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
Houston Methodist Hospital System refused to get vaccinated

367
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
How are suspended from their positions

368
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
So they sued the judge recently dismissed

369
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
What are the reasons that they're kasecamp

370
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Possibly win in court is

371
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Because they're in Texas

372
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
And in that state

373
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,447
Every week protections for employees in cases of wrongful termination

374
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Bedard in the judge

375
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Decision they spell this out

376
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:36,735
Quote Texas law only protect employees from being terminated for refusing to commit an act carrying criminal penalties

377
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
To the worker

378
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,623
Based on that standard refusing to get a vaccine can't possibly meet the criteria needed to satisfy their charge

379
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,903
But interesting Lee

380
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
Alex is example of injecting yourself with cyanide

381
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
I was hit that standard for wrongful termination because that would be a criminal act that would be the only example

382
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,543
Chile Jesus so anyway this is crazy huh

383
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
I mean they have

384
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
Sort of these that he's weak Protections in place

385
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
And warriors

386
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Can make

387
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
These

388
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Sorted

389
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
Conditions of employment center Alex

390
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,903
Thrilled with that until he's not for everybody

391
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,024
This fits my policies and telefono

392
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
So now back to the vein

393
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
Varsity storyline which is

394
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
Dot-com

395
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Boating information

396
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,872
What is the headline for today

397
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,248
Emergency broadcast

398
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Like the emergency

399
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
Reporter who exposed Clinton control of

400
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
FBI

401
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Executed inside his home

402
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
Very very professionally

403
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
The problem here is that Alex can't prove any of this

404
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:00,448
Recycle the scene play out over and over again and conspiracy culture

405
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
By Alex reporting this as a defendant of execution

406
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
You feel like he's just creating a thriller plot around a tragic

407
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
But ultimately there's a lot more going on

408
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,224
Because Alex is so sure that this was a professional X

409
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
Execution he's giving the audience permission to be just as certain

410
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
And this leads to problems they encounter people who don't share their certainty

411
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,744
People like victims family members are government officials or media figures

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,072
Who don't comport with the conspiracy version of this death are now

413
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
Is being participants

414
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Or engaged in the cover-up

415
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
These people often get hurt or harassed

416
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
Sometimes in these conspiracy campaign

417
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
Alex don't give a s***

418
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
About them or their well-being

419
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,480
There's nothing wrong with holding some skepticism or asking questions about events that happen

420
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
The appropriate thing to do then however

421
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:51,136
Is to explore the questions privately by reading or interviewing people

422
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
We're doing some other kind of investigative technique

423
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
I'm trying to find some actual information

424
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
This is not what Alex does

425
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
He doesn't ask

426
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424
He makes decisions about how to write other people's stories so they fit the narrative that he

427
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
To make a profit off of

428
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
And it's to the detriment of the people who are involved

429
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
The word

430
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
The worst part is just

431
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
Like

432
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Putting that per

433
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,200
Professional in there yet

434
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,064
Okay so we do look into it we find out that it's absolutely a suicide

435
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,648
Right well that's how you know it was a professional right only a professor

436
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
Evidence of

437
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
The conclusion that Alex is already read

438
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
You can't

439
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:41,056
Applicants and overwhelming evidence is even more evidence that the conspiracies true

440
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
To be just a little bit of evidence in that sweet spot

441
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:48,480
And this is bad because I mean obviously I think anyone listening to our show can understand why this is

442
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
Is bad

443
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:54,880
Even more than we've already discussed and that's because Alex is presenting this as like

444
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
A real escalation

445
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,048
Same things from the globalist assassinating reporters in order to cover up

446
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,680
They're dirty and there's going to be a lot more of the crossing of the Rubicon

447
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,616
Padma hold other Rubicon

448
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
It's because the globalist are so incredible

449
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
Everything they're doing

450
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Willing to kill

451
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
Hundreds of millions of people attended vaccines

452
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
They're willing to do any

453
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,912
I just don't understand how anybody could hear this show

454
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
And not think

455
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
He's telling you to

456
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
Kill people yeah that's the only

457
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Like they've gone offense

458
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
Assassinating the people who are putting their business in the streets

459
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
And Reporting the truth quote on quote about things

460
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Sprite right so

461
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
What what

462
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,576
How how does

463
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
I don't understand how he can present like

464
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,672
Do do anything violent

465
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:04,768
You literally cannot use the metaphor of Crossing

466
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,144
In the Rubicon because the point of the metaphor of Crossing the Rubicon is that once this happens

467
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
You cannot be unhappy

468
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,240
Yeah

469
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:20,128
The line the language that he's using it and the way he's presenting the stories very specifically about like

470
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
The game has changed

471
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
And now the Rules of Engagement are differ

472
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Right

473
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
I don't understand how he

474
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,576
Can pretend that that's not what he's doing

475
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,160
I don't understand how this could be the inciting incident if

476
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,208
We're already confirmed that

477
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,512
The people who have the vaccine are going to

478
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
He kills or already dead or whatever it is

479
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
This seems like a d escalation about if anything's

480
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,264
Thank God they're only killing individual people instead of murdering the entire country

481
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
The stakes are weird

482
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
They're not quite as in order as the Matrix related

483
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
The hundreds of thousands of people are billions of people live in packs

484
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Well it's the way that Alex needs to tell the story

485
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
That's

486
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Stroke

487
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
That's just passive murder

488
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
This is active but this is when the Cold War goes hot

489
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
So this clip is 4 minutes long

490
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
And I think it's a ride

491
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,144
Journey

492
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
It's

493
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
Starts

494
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
With Alex

495
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Enthralling

496
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Clip of Sia

497
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
Christmas I'm talking on Fox News

498
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
That clip does not get

499
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
Okay then said it will be a ride

500
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
Alex Rambles about how big of a threat

501
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
He's under us about himself cuz of course he does

502
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
For the course

503
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,976
Admitted ends in a way that will take your breath away

504
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Doritos from the grave

505
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,120
Talking about all the death threats and courage

506
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
Is that all these big lawsuits filed against us

507
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
Job

508
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Party groups

509
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
A lot of stuff that

510
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Disbelieve me

511
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
What

512
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
I know it's rather big National talk show host

513
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
Take the threats and bass

514
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Stop

515
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,424
Back off

516
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,800
Sure for me it's about

517
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
I feel close to God

518
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Composite right there just to

519
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Is Macho

520
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,368
In his conception I think that is the same

521
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,256
Endorphin rush or whatever that someone would get from posturing as a macho person

522
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
It's just putting the

523
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Context in language of Godly

524
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
Or whatever

525
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,776
I think the only time that I am close to God is when I am acting violence

526
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
That's not good

527
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
This even entertain selling out

528
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Alone and

529
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Why the service of humanity

530
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,184
I'm just a very blessed person

531
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
It's not going to be a failure

532
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
It's going to be a real success

533
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
Is a reckless enough to kill me

534
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
Put me in prison

535
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
VIP Automotive

536
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Locations of cooking up

537
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
Fine I understand

538
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,568
That's not me bro

539
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,128
Throw

540
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,176
Amazon pro

541
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Another

542
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Even after I'm dead

543
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
That sucks but whatever

544
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
Easier

545
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,816
But I will not have them kill me

546
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
I didn't say

547
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
That

548
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
How they operate

549
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,592
What they've done really good manatee plasm

550
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
You know it is a come when you're there with your wife and kid

551
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,968
I'm just going to be completely honest about this

552
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Tough guy turn levels

553
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,112
But I have to really think about everything operates at and then the way things really are

554
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
And so I mistaken the Spy

555
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,256
But I do need 24-hour day security for my children

556
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,144
I'm really most the time but I need to have real security I mean guys on the road

All the time

558
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Because you know

559
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
That was a big

560
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,016
Just a reminder two-and-a-half minutes ago Alex was introducing a clip

Unpause

00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,576
Car bomb goes off

572
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
This is a very good chance to return

573
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,440
They're little armies Busan

574
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,024
They'll kill Tucker

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,552
Killing people

581
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Guess what

582
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
I'm going to be a soft target for these people

583
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,048
I'm not going to let him tie me up or they blow my wife and children's heads off

584
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
Sure

585
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
For the real security I need I'm leaving at that I've got done

586
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
The time

587
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
What is happening

588
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
All the time

589
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,712
My family

590
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
Target

591
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,344
Selling products

592
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
Opera

594
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,776
Thrilled to have your ad play George Noory

596
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
Is he selling products based

597
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,344
Getting people to pay for security for a family

598
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
Okay

599
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Alright

600
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,464
Basically he's saying that if you don't buy more of his pills

601
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:03,072
His family will be murdered in front of

602
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Wow

603
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
I just thought I thought it was pretty shocking

604
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
That it ran into money

605
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:14,592
At the end I shouldn't be shot it was going it was so intense

606
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,456
It's like so off track from where the eclipse started in what he was

607
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Trying to do

608
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,112
We just cover this story and he's not talk about himself like I don't want him to kill my family

609
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
I need more security

610
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,464
Okay here's a paranoid spiral

611
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,024
Whatever I can go well I get it

612
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
I think that's in the Alex Jones wheelhouse

613
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
Then when it turned into like

614
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Using that paranoid

615
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Spiral

616
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
To be like I need more money for the security detail

617
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
That's what I like

618
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
This is crap

619
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
He saw that they were coming up on the commercial

620
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
He knew that he was about to go to break

621
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
He's like

622
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Oh my God

623
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
At

624
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
Perfect

625
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
I can't afford security I need you all to pay for my security Rudolph

626
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Absolutely brutal

627
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
I don't know what world

628
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,632
I don't know what the rest of the world would look like if one day I woke up in the headline was

629
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
Tucker Carlson dies in carbs

630
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Like

631
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
What

632
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
The IRA is back like what are we

633
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
The IRA limit in New York

634
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,128
I think

635
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
If like

636
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
Selected people like Ron and Rand Paul and Alex Jones at Tucker Carlson all died in a short. Of time

637
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Ivan

638
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
Even I as somebody who'd the space of being full

639
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Disinformation

640
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
And bulshit

641
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
I like those problem

642
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Well f*** there is a problem this is an issue there

643
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
They're probably still wrong

644
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,104
But you know hey maybe there is some kind of a fringe left-wing terrorist

645
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,920
That we have not been aware of

646
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:57,504
Or something would be a shock if we discovered a strange

647
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,344
Paramed paramilitary leftist organization

648
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
I would I would start having

649
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Some questions if there was a convenient series

650
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
All of these people.

651
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Even if it was

652
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,216
Justin Tucker Carlson a car bomb

653
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
Holyshit something's not right

654
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Yeah

655
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,664
What is happening in this world

656
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,224
I mean all of this

657
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
Predicted didn't happen there was not

658
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
You know this

659
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
This wave.

660
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,208
The 13th right okay we're recording this on the seven

661
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
That's correct okay

662
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
Tucker is still technically alive from what I understand you

663
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
So is Ron Paul

664
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,448
You just can't kill rampal with the car bomb

665
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,984
He's to craft

666
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
He smelled it out so

667
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
But again

668
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:57,408
Seems like Larry Nichols would be exactly who Alex would want to throw into the mix on there

669
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Patel Brother

670
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
Not bring him up at all

671
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
They just forgot about him

672
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,296
In this next clip Alex salute

673
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
That's the short sets for sign

674
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,000
And then of course makes it about himself

675
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
Grotto

676
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,144
Brave died

677
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Hellboy

678
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
The coward Taste of death

679
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Okay

680
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
I'll tell you

681
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
Again they are bringing us

682
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
Free books to read about it

683
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Grandpa about it when they were alive

684
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
And a certain point you're just like well

685
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Alright

686
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Sleeves up here

687
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,424
Nobody should be offensive rebound against you

688
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
Used

689
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Neutral coming for long time.

690
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
They're going to start

691
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,600
I don't understand what offensive Lee Violet even means anymore on his show

692
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,000
Keep your eyes peeled for people to attack you saying that we wore mode

693
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,352
These people like to blow up the Waco Branch Davidian course

694
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
OKC is their fault not ours

695
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,496
I don't understand I don't understand

696
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
These terms even mean in the way he's using them

697
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,872
Because I have a definition of offensively Violet night don't think

698
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
April 2nd

699
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,992
Is the way he's using the term does not seem the same

700
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
Silence talks about Karma

701
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
Oh he should not what goes around comes around my biggest want to find out

702
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
There's a large Bleach

703
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Face.

704
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
Call it karma what goes around comes around going to reboot yourself

705
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
In my life

706
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
I never even wanted you bad stuff every time I did

707
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,104
Great life.com would because I really been pretty good person

708
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
And I really want

709
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
Weak or stupid

710
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
And you think you're going to get away get away with it

711
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Caught my attention

712
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
To the wild

713
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,288
So here's here's what was missing from the broadcast

714
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,592
I treat people like I want to be treated

715
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
And what I don't do that I'm guilty

716
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Okay I'll try to make it

717
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,112
Weak or stupid know what's weak and s******* all over people's you f****** piece of s*** New Order

718
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,256
And you think you're going to get away with it forever you're not going to get away with it

719
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:57,120
Damn he still bad it's just really bad at using swear

720
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
You know what else do you like

721
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
Clippers at in the video

722
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
And there's a look on his face it's like

723
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,568
Did it again

724
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,480
I don't think he's that good of a performer to be able to give that subtle look of like

725
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
Yeah

726
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
I slept in

727
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Screamed obscenities again

728
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Weird

729
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
Play childish

730
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
Bums me out

731
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,256
I feel like people should learn how to swear

732
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,584
For someone like myself where the potty mouth

733
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,632
I accept that

734
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah it's still the way I would squares is a little childish

735
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
It's a little bit

736
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,032
Yeah AB dub

737
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,104
Teach children swears but I am saying as a child you should learn them

738
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
So Alex needs to get his family

739
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Security

740
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,808
But he also in a sex with his talking about them as if they're just like collateral damage

741
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
And by that I mean he literally says that their collateral.

742
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
My family so much

743
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
There's no future

744
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
If you don't make me swallow so I've taken out of my mind

745
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
The opposite of sociopath

746
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,424
Just my

747
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
Collateral damage

748
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
It's not like I asked for this

749
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
My family

750
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,640
Government make me stop what I'm doing

751
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
But I will not leave on the chessboard

752
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,784
The chance of them having their victory

753
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Where they kill me

754
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
And my family and then blame me for it

755
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
So I got to have people cuz I don't

756
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't have a computer

757
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,864
Working working working working for comes out always

758
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
Security I was already

759
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:41,312
Calling my security police agencies we done and then I saw this story on Infowars

760
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,664
2 hours reading all about the angles of it at all

761
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Anytime I'm with

762
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Really sounds Speedy to me

763
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,856
Yeah this is really f****** on accept

764
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
Audible

765
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,744
They're tossing around here he's connecting thoughts on the way there

766
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Very scattered

767
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
I'm it's a little bored

768
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,168
I assume this is all because of the few articles that were like

769
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728
Alex was coordinating with Trump for the 6th

770
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
Thrive

771
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
Maybe he does

772
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Mention that a little bit

773
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,200
Show me pulling Eclipse it was disconnected from these other

774
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,528
This other story

775
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
Totally dismissive about that

776
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:31,488
To be dismissive

777
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:35,584
Yeah yeah we're going to the Capitol

778
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,888
That is that is true

779
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
100%

780
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,960
I don't I don't think that it's related

781
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Right

782
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
But he's just

783
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Going so hard with

784
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
Personal Chittenden the factor

785
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
Like the moment you go from

786
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
Like we need to protect our family to like

787
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Acknowledge that your family's already dead

788
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:59,392
Is is when you turn people into a holy Army and there's just no

789
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,976
I mean. He's in some ways Crossing the Rubicon if you will

790
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
That's f***** up I don't disagree with you but I also have heard him say stuff

791
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Like this in the past

792
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Things have gotten like fairly intense

793
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
For him he will he will

794
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,688
Talk about like I give my family up to God

795
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Before it just seems like

796
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,296
And it's rare and feels

797
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,880
Worse it's it definitely well in our current context

798
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Today feels

799
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Pretentious

800
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
More than it would have been like

801
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:41,120
The late nineties you know you didn't get the sense that everybody was kind of itching for a holy war in the late 90s

802
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
Battle over f****** say

803
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Satanism or whatever it is you know

804
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Yam

805
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
So Alex is spam

806
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,128
All of the show

807
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
Rambling about his own

808
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,479
Need for security and how

809
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,271
They story

810
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,623
About this Sir Christopher sign is really a warning to people like him

811
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,183
And you are really real narcissistic s***

812
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
Quick fix

813
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
Quick thought

814
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,095
Thought

815
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,423
Art snipers on the roof more to keep people in then

816
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Keep people out

817
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
I'm not sure but Alex has many time starts better yet snipers on the roof of Infowars

818
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
To keep people in

819
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
I don't know

820
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
You see people in the back of your sniping on top of a roof

821
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,807
So that's why I've always seen it

822
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Interesting

823
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,647
Anyway Alex is not covered really anything

824
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
But he has a lot of

825
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
All this incredible news to cover tonight so much

826
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
I'd so much preparation for the show today

827
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
And I haven't gotten a lot of that.

828
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,751
Want a message to reporter

829
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
You do not

830
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Report

831
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
On

832
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,407
Clinton with the Attorney General on the tarmac

833
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
What

834
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
You do not report on this thing

835
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,671
That will literally never happen again and was widely reported

836
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,975
Every Outlet

837
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Alright

838
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,375
All the New York Times journalist

839
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,679
Dad Washington Post

840
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Dad

841
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,799
It seems like he's very desperate to excuse him not doing his job

842
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
That's what it feels like

843
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
So I was like okay well at least he's getting interest

844
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
Everybody's got more time on the show

845
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,551
He can get into these stories that he's failed to cover because he got caught up in this

846
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,087
Next

847
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:43,487
What domination in Conquest in war with us because

848
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,655
I'm not against nerds I don't even get into what you want

849
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,007
Alpha

850
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
They're not

851
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Ugly

852
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
That's like they're covered

853
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
Anybody that they would call

854
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,527
In modern parlance a Chad or someone is

855
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
The enemy

856
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,367
Will show chin modern parlor

857
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Crazy little scientist

858
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,511
What's algae

859
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
I don't I don't know if

860
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,911
How I feel about Alex

861
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
Talking about Chad's

862
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,591
Sometimes nerves bully meeting with their brains and I'm supposed to believe them with my bronze

863
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,871
I don't like it

864
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
I don't I don't I don't know what this is

865
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Useful

866
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,247
Kuwait has spent time

867
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
On the show

868
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,855
I mean saying

869
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,415
Inferiority complexes is

870
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,743
Something vetted maybe Alex

871
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,351
What's on the phone

872
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Channel

873
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:58,751
Wait wait for you mister pop the problem is I like some of these wimps

874
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,663
Pretend that they're constantly under attack in order to escalate the things that they're talking about to make themselves more interesting

875
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,503
He's door Kendall constantly talk about how they're so tough

876
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Deep down inside there.

877
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
Bello super into Star Wars but they tell you that they weren't super into Star Wars

878
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,023
You think they rendered right

879
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:26,143
So Alex is another clip that he wants to play too but up to this guy Frank

880
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Figliozzi

881
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
Is a former FBI

882
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
Agent

883
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:38,175
Guy in the FBI that does have a name of an F-350 gliozzi

884
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,063
Never heard what I was saying that he wants Congress arrested

885
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
It's not quite

886
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Not quite

887
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
But Alex

888
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,671
Also wants

889
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
Congress arrested

890
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
Watch them to have trials

891
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
Okay that's import that's very nice of him now they already know the outcome

892
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,495
Without trial with arrest members of Congress I would stash we off the air

893
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Everybody

894
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
The water's edge

895
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
McDonald's

896
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,551
What they've done yes

897
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,135
I would want without a trial cuz that's something I kept my kid

898
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
Rules

899
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:27,071
Jerks they always get rid of chivalry

900
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
That was get rid of the rules

901
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
One step ahead

902
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Then there

903
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Just in my wheelhouse that point

904
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,359
My wheelhouse people like me

905
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
I don't want

906
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
More

907
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
I don't want that

908
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Like a pig in slop on start

909
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,367
Bhuban like asleep

910
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,463
Am I really feel sorry for the staff

911
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
Because I looked at every possible exit from this

912
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,839
It does not end well for them

913
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,935
I don't know I don't know the difference between this and being like

914
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
We have cells in every city

915
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
Totally

916
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:14,943
Basically how a terrorist makes threat of a terrorist with a f****** mask on going

917
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,271
We will Grill your soldiers.

918
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,599
F*** off with your trial b*******

919
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
How dare you tell me that you just upload files

920
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:34,399
Come was anything other than the one that I have for rent

921
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
But the trial is important

922
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Silly

923
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,591
Also I love the idea that he's like Mitch McConnell should go to prison

924
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:47,711
Except when he's acting in line with what Trump wants

925
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,575
As long as he's doing that I was aboard him staying in office when I will

926
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
Defend him

927
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,879
Also deserve to go to prison

928
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:00,255
You know what really shocked me they had a Mitch McConnell story I recently they had the gall

929
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
To ask Mitch

930
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
McConnell if he would see the Supreme Court just

931
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,167
By biting intro yeah I saw that

932
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,983
Do you think McConnell

933
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
I said

934
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Yes

935
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:17,407
A nice cuz I did see this story and I thought it was like

936
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,223
What a waste of everyone's time

937
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,783
What a waste

938
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
List of everyone

939
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Outrageous course he wasn't going to do that in 2024

940
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,631
Frank figliozzi

941
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
I think his interpretation of it is a little bit off

942
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,007
This is such a criminal statement

943
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
I publicly on the hill that what happened on January 6th as domestic Terror

944
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
What have we learned

945
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,247
From our experience with International terrorism

946
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
In order to add nothing

947
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,087
Resting

948
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,135
Operatives is merely a speedball

949
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,415
Not a roadblock

950
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
In order to grow really tackle terrorism in this line.

951
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,303
You've got to attack and dismantle

952
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,887
The command-and-control element of a terrorist group

953
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
And on football

954
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
Take it back to the beginning

955
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
I know this is painful

956
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
We've got to attack

957
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
Let me chill

958
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Shutdown

959
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
The Brain Trust if the Republicans

960
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,159
Pedophile seats for kids are open the borders and

961
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:37,791
Philosophical

962
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
I don't

963
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,055
Know if that's the one I would I would have taken away from the

964
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,639
But I have some problems with what I figure they were saying

965
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,223
Just from a different angle

966
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:01,343
Certainly the way that we have carried out a war on terror around the world is a good model

967
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,391
How we would approach the best

968
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,743
Flawed I can't think of anybody I want dealing with domestic

969
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,607
State terrorism less than everyone who has dealt with every type of terrorism

970
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,191
Concept is not busy

971
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,519
I think there's a lot of dangers when you start

972
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Trying to apply

973
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,359
The way that we have as a country

974
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Behave

975
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
These RV International terrorism

976
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
I am trying to apply that to domestic

977
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Issues of terrorism

978
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,855
I think they'd tell you run into a lot of issues and I hope I would hope that we

979
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Choose a different way.

980
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:41,535
Brooks if there's anything that we know happened it's that whenever our soldiers trying to deal with International terrorism

981
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:47,935
To those places they viewed everybody as a possible combat and then that's what I want them to bring back home right possibilities

982
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,239
Everyone you live with is a combat

983
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,335
It's not good and I would argue with

984
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
Figliozzi on that on that tack

985
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,943
I would also

986
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,039
I would also say that there is something to be said for the other point

987
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
But he's making though

988
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
You're disconnected from

989
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,999
That's why it is that everybody who got into the capitol on the 6th

990
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,791
Isn't necessarily going

991
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
Cause the

992
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:17,119
Kind of changed that you would hope to write

993
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:20,959
Prosecutorial Eeyore from disruption of

994
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
What causes

995
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,287
That's not be approached

996
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
That you want to take there's a broader Spectrum

997
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,663
Of love and end

998
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
And things that you would want to do

999
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
Yeah

1000
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
I do agree with that

1001
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
I just don't agree with

1002
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
His

1003
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,159
His comparison between International terrorism

1004
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Domestic terrorism

1005
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,279
And I also agree with you that what lessons have we learned nothing

1006
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:52,191
Nothing also Frank figliozzi has not been in the FBI's enter 2012

1007
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,031
He does not speak for any organization in any official capacity

1008
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,567
That is what I was looking

1009
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Looking for

1010
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
So

1011
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
I just

1012
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
I think that Alex is interpretation that this is silly

1013
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,015
It's just the same thing that sadist hypersensitivity that you see in the right

1014
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
You know like when Biden says that

1015
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
The main Terror threat in the United

1016
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,135
Midstates comes in the form of white supremacist groups

1017
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,975
The metallics and all of his friends reported Biden said that white people are the bigger

1018
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
Just threaten the country

1019
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,303
It's just the same game being played here

1020
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
Hummingbird

1021
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
To act like that

1022
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,727
That obviously if there's anything that we've learned from the way that the right is

1023
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
Behaved whenever there's even the slightest

1024
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Threat to

1025
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Their ability to act with a

1026
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
Computer date

1027
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
It's to go ape

1028
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,991
And clearly that's the best strategy cuz nobody's been able to do anything about it

1029
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Yeah it is

1030
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,087
It does gum up the works really does

1031
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,671
Like you said he has a lot of big news to cover

1032
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
What a big stuff

1033
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,767
Sure got this clip of Frank figliozzi

1034
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,351
The fix yours is

1035
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:57,471
Problem

1036
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
And this is

1037
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Just

1038
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
I have no idea

1039
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
I have no idea why this

1040
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,735
You please a video of someone coming out as a trans

1041
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
Man oh boy

1042
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
People clap

1043
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
Yeah

1044
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,111
And I don't know why he's mad at

1045
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,439
Play crate all the people who were working in their life

1046
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,743
Brainwashed by leftist

1047
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Behavior

1048
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Manipulation

1049
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,471
Squeal and squawk and scream

1050
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:33,311
Because this person is declared themselves something else instead

1051
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,103
Celebration of transhumanism

1052
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
And there's a weird social worker in the Press like

1053
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,551
It just goes on and on here it is

1054
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
So these are the Lost helpless people

1055
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,671
The system is now in total control off

1056
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
I don't understand

1057
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:24,255
What Alex is going off of

1058
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,791
Other than

1059
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
There's a person speak

1060
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
Looking to a group who support them then

1061
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
Affirm and validate them

1062
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
I don't get how he can

1063
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
Take this and be like hahaha this person has been

1064
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Been tricked into doing

1065
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,431
Or whatever it is

1066
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,991
The only way he can do that is by

1067
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,783
Complete invalidation of

1068
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
The existing

1069
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:52,671
That's really the only way you arrived at that conclusion is that everybody

1070
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
It is being

1071
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,303
No I I was kind of Blown Away by

1072
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,351
You know like I stay away from

1073
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
From that world so much but

1074
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
My

1075
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
Family is

1076
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Like

1077
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
Told me about some

1078
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,127
Super Christian literature written by pastors and s*** that are like

1079
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,407
Here's why

1080
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,943
People think they're boys

1081
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
Zora

1082
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
Not like

1083
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
This is Eva

1084
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
Possible

1085
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Blanket rejection of the

1086
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,855
The possibility

1087
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:22,879
And

1088
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
Your like Society has failed

1089
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
So I mean

1090
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,791
I had no idea really how deep that

1091
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,583
Believe what I thought they'd at least we're like

1092
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,607
Oh they're human

1093
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,143
You know like it's it's just

1094
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,447
Mind-boggling

1095
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,775
The sorts of things that Alex is taking his time with

1096
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
And Manny gets to the end of the

1097
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
It's towards the end of the show and realizes

1098
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
Haven't done my job

1099
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:52,575
The great Owen Shroyer coming to hook two hours of live radio / TV and I'm in

1100
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:58,975
I got the time

1101
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,047
Reporter that exposed

1102
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,607
Call FEI being under control the Deep state

1103
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
Yeah yeah

1104
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,519
I kind of wasted the first hour of the show so

1105
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:17,919
I'm going to do the actual job on another show and maybe probably won't

1106
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:24,063
Yeah I am supposed to do

1107
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
And interrupt him and

1108
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,207
Keep him from doing that very same what I'm going to be soft

1109
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,999
Sandwich

1110
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,583
A all-time little respect for this

1111
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:43,007
I understand that I was like who cares I'm still on air

1112
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
This is your show

1113
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,823
This is your two-hour block

1114
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
You can't just

1115
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
Co-op someone else's show

1116
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,943
Have you liked all that we're going to do the real stuff

1117
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,527
I'm just kind of felt I'm yelling about bulshit here

1118
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,855
I tried to get you to pay for my family's Blackwater guards

1119
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
Power Rangers

1120
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
It is

1121
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Just dumb

1122
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:06,559
It is very out I would like to get mad at him when he's doing his job

1123
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,143
Get mad at him when it seems like he's

1124
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
He's on his

1125
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Olden time

1126
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
Yeah yeah

1127
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,751
I do prefer

1128
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,335
Feeling like we are actually responding to something

1129
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:23,199
Deserve a mutual professionalism

1130
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
So Alex

1131
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Racist

1132
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,343
Forget to hear at the end of the show

1133
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Can't close without it

1134
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Nope

1135
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
So

1136
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
I don't even know how to set this up

1137
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
It's just outrageous

1138
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Barry group killing black people and

1139
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
Dumping them down a drug dealer neighborhood

1140
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
Gangster rap

1141
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,455
Tells you all day how much they love black people and how they're just so sweet

1142
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,551
Are you drive down the road almost all the Billboards are black people for every corporation

1143
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
And all the big TV ads are black

1144
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
The global of corporations are

1145
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
Putting a black

1146
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Face

1147
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
On everything they do

1148
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,119
Is it all black people

1149
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
You got to be nice to them

1150
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:16,703
Camouflage

1151
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,007
Can't have people paying you got to be.

1152
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
You are going to then

1153
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,919
Your operations and say black people are doing this

1154
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,711
Anderson conscious level

1155
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,247
If you hate the government you hate

1156
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,271
Corporation

1157
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
The UN

1158
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
You hate all this

1159
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,391
What are you do

1160
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Oh God holy

1161
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,743
Shitz racism as always

1162
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
Is everybody else's fault

1163
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
I was blown away by

1164
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
DeSoto

1165
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,703
Articulation of how Alex sees the world

1166
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:53,311
Yeah wow BLM gave us NWA 40 years ago

1167
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:59,711
I would guess that Alex is using some sort of selection bias about all the Billboards are black people

1168
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
Babies could be

1169
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,319
Maybe you getting mad cuz he sees some black people there in

1170
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
Because that's different to me I notice it's so now I assume that it is going to 100% the opposite direction

1171
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,935
You're all of the instances of the things that don't make me mad

1172
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,751
Because seeing black people in ads makes me mad

1173
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:29,407
I am a child I am a child I think like a child and I have no higher order thinking

1174
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,431
Skills whatsoever

1175
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
Yeah

1176
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
And misses

1177
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Is a bit much

1178
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,831
So again

1179
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,159
Why does racism happened Dan

1180
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:46,815
It's because the government and corporations put a black face on things nothing to do with I don't know

1181
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,631
Several hundred years or f******

1182
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
Let's be honest

1183
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,191
Several thousand years

1184
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:55,775
Of massive races of nope nope nope nope

1185
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,567
It's cuz the corporations in the government

1186
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Now

1187
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
That's why

1188
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,151
That's why white people are so racist

1189
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,223
Commercial everybody knows it everybody knows it

1190
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
Commercial kiss commercial

1191
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:12,927
It's because one time I saw a black person eat McDonald's with a smile on TV and now I'm

1192
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,743
I don't tell you I'm not loving it

1193
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,631
This is this is a bit of a leader

1194
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,471
Two story about this recent shooting

1195
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
In Austin

1196
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,055
There was a concert

1197
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
And there was a shooting there and

1198
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
Alex

1199
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,919
Have some stuff to say about it

1200
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
We love God or we love Satan

1201
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
Are we a dumbass says you're the one exist

1202
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,415
PS4 God of your dumbass

1203
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,767
And of course

1204
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Ha

1205
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
There's a great example of this

1206
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,983
Most I would like an example

1207
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,055
Are pain relief

1208
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
So

1209
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
Hispanic Hispanic

1210
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,431
Black on black

1211
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,759
I want to do

1212
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
It's white on white

1213
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
Who the Hell's Angels in the

1214
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
And the

1215
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Good they were fighting

1216
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
California

1217
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
The Mongols

1218
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,023
So

1219
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,095
That's how it works so when I hear about nightclub shot up

1220
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,935
In Miami no say what was about so I looked it up it's a black

1221
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Nightclub

1222
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
I bet

1223
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,359
Sure enough it was two rival gang

1224
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,431
But about what color they work it's the reality of

1225
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
I hear some

1226
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:46,111
Right-wing square dance going on in the middle of Alabama had a shooting at Uncle that must be some

1227
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,159
White

1228
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Here's what I'm getting at

1229
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
Story is so huge

1230
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
Because it's not about

1231
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Protecting black

1232
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
It's about the media the control Corp

1233
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Romania

1234
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,031
Being able to set the precedent

1235
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
That whenever they want

1236
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Hi.

1237
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
Austin

1238
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
Star Wars

1239
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,991
Pacific Democrats got way worse now

1240
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,039
They'll be a serious

1241
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,087
Divorce

1242
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
I could get a house that a real place

1243
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,767
2nd Street all that area

1244
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,375
Call and 12th

1245
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
No it didn't

1246
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,239
It happened on 2nd Colorado Cuz I saw it

1247
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,031
I heard the gunshots

1248
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,591
So that's why this is so dangerous

1249
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
So you got a

1250
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
Hip-hop concert

1251
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Going on

1252
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Who do you think's going to be at that

1253
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,247
Water people

1254
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Wild

1255
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,855
Mass shooting in Austin

1256
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Texas leave 13 wounded

1257
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,999
Can you imagine

1258
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
That shot into a crowd of mixed

1259
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
People

1260
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:03,423
Yes I can't matter why you did it then say it was white supremacy

1261
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Well I guess what he's saying that at the end is like if circumstances were different people would cover it differently

1262
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
Sure

1263
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Okay

1264
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
Sub argument

1265
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,479
White supremacist never kill anybody

1266
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,527
That's out

1267
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,855
Main argument that he is burying

1268
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,695
Yeah this is this is weird

1269
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,999
This is weird I don't know how Alex

1270
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,815
Has evidence of crimes that were committed

1271
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,375
Being placed elsewhere in the city

1272
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
I don't know what like I'm

1273
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703
I love to imagine Alex just in like

1274
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
You know a duster

1275
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
Old-timey

1276
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,127
Detective from Noir going out there on

1277
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,687
On the 2nd and Colorado

1278
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,271
I know they're going to say this is at least off that I know it

1279
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:56,415
There's a guy wearing a press badge in is it in his hat just walking around

1280
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:03,583
The only thing Alex has in common with like those sort of Noir detective is a pension

1281
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
A booze

1282
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,935
The only thing yes,

1283
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
And yeah

1284
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
I think

1285
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,543
I think that this is also

1286
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
A bit scattered

1287
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
In terms of

1288
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
Thinking there's a lot of stuff going all over the place

1289
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,735
When he was in an apartment he knew the two crimes happened to differ

1290
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Some places than they said they were

1291
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,831
Also all these various shooting

1292
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,207
What's going on here is that he believes that the media is trying to cover up

1293
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,231
The

1294
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
Notion that the shooter in this Austin

1295
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
Suitcase was a black

1296
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,399
He's going to talk about this year

1297
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,239
Disagree with his point entirely

1298
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:46,335
Amy Fox Carey that press conference every other channel didn't

1299
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
The Austin american-statesman

1300
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,199
One further

1301
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
They said

1302
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,879
Firestone police have only released a vague description

1303
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,671
The suspect shooter

1304
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
As of Saturday morning

1305
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
Gothenburg State including the option

1306
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,327
By the way

1307
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,887
Smart

1308
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,727
In perpetrating stereotypes

1309
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
Released

1310
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
We will update

1311
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
Airport

1312
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
Picked up my check today hour ago

1313
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Why is that so important

1314
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Why is that so

1315
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
Because

1316
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,319
Color somebody yes

1317
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,159
But they're driving what they're dressed like

1318
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
To stop them and find them

1319
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,583
So does editor's note that Alex is reading from the Statesman

1320
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,423
I found it and it's in the article about the shooter's arrest

1321
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727
At the point of the article's publication to Vegas

1322
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:51,103
Description of the shooter is no longer really that important for pup the public safety angle that Alex is talking about

1323
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,479
The newspaper does not have identifying information released to them because the suspect is a juvenile

1324
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,599
Just really simple explanations for you know all of this stuff that Alex is

1325
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,879
Claiming is so confusing

1326
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:06,719
And it comes from the very Source material that Alex is going off of

1327
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
But it's more important

1328
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,047
Constraints do quite Sapphira

1329
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Couldn't agree

1330
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
Yeah I was going to say it's

1331
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
It's

1332
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Very I don't know if I've ever heard of white dude describe why what

1333
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:24,127
What he's doing is not racist without being incredibly racist about

1334
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
That is a phenomenon that Alex falls victim

1335
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,479
Yeah

1336
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,111
Cuz it seems like if you heard it you know like the best deal white person can probably do is be like Hey listen

1337
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,927
I was raised racist in a racist ass country

1338
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,231
I got blind spots I'm doing my best

1339
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:43,071
Please tell me when I'm being racist cuz I'm sure I will be

1340
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,351
My bad I'll learn

1341
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Not Alex

1342
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
No

1343
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:50,239
No no different approach to it

1344
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,335
That's why I don't I don't know why I feel like this

1345
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,407
This whole display at the end of the show is Real gross

1346
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Hey

1347
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
Why didn't you get to the news

1348
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
That's a good question or was that a big

1349
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Story or what

1350
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
At the end of the show right is he going out to

1351
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
Throwing it to Owen

1352
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,767
Gets to one of the big headlines that he didn't

1353
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
This is huge

1354
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
News if true

1355
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Which I don't think

1356
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
Elusive defense

1357
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:30,431
Department admits major Defector has been there for over a year provide evidence of Chinese military

1358
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,015
Orchestrated the creation of the covid-19

1359
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:40,671
Analyse the bio-weapon an important day is so cute

1360
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
Do you not want you to know this

1361
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,791
You don't want people to know it

1362
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:53,215
Theoretically confirmation of everything he's ever said it's theoretically biggest news ever

1363
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,479
The Chinese military's released a bioweapon that is

1364
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,527
Killed millions of people

1365
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,063
Okay

1366
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,087
You have two hours

1367

1368

Me about me for the first two hours

1369
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
So

1370
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,079
So that's how he answers and

1371
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:34,175
I think I think you're all I ever get all does does MASH with like

1372
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,967
Who he is as a

1373

Self

1374
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,551
Totally

1375
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
It's intense

1376
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:45,439
It's trying to incite people towards violence or sex transphobic it's races

1377
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,719
Its side

1378
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743

Self-critical of

1382
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,423
I haven't got to the stuff that

1383
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Haven't done any

1384
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
But it's about

1385
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
Now

1386
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,383
It is it is like a

It is a weight is a show that is entirely around what if

1392
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
You just gave that kid

1393
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
3 hours today

1394
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,743
To try and distract himself away from revealing

1395
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
He didn't do the work

1396
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
Yeah it's almost a really interesting bluffing

1397
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,887
Improv exercise

1398
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,703
Getaway it kind of is

1399
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:34,591
If it wasn't so destructive and dangerous it might be the greatest 27-year login Harold

1400
