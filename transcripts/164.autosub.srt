I need your help about this thank you

84
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
I've been getting criticism

85
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,367
From people who watch the live stream

86
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
Thing to you and because you they were saying it to you you're like

87
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:27,167
I agree with you I think it would be nice

88
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
Mean criticism it away

89
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Okay

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
A literary criticism

91
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
You and I having a conversation

92
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,391
Could be an argument that we're not fighting

93
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
Connotations that it might otherwise

94
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
And I would like to let you know

95
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Yes I am

96
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
When is episode comes out

97
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287

98
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055

99
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Congratulate

100
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Thank you

101
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
So

102
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
Number people who suggested

103
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,623
I'm really criticism that's like let me translate it

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,375
We love you

105
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
Nobody is

106
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
Sent me that message so I think everybody don't know

107
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
Baby keep going

108
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,639
I think the messages on the chat room during the live show

109
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,735
Combined

110
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
I would like to

111
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,207
People who sent two messages that have been encouraging that direction.

112
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Is it a moment where I'm like

113
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
I don't need to

114
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Tool anymore

115
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
I don't want to

116
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
That's that's some self-actualization

117
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
Thank you a lot of messages

118
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Couple

D'smoke

In that recording is 6 days

122
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
The worst friend

123
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
My schedule

124
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,375
Able to talk this week because of your shows and

125
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Terrible

126
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
I've been working

127
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
1820 hour days on

128
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
Some research

129
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
I'm in

130
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
It's so

131
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
But yeah it's it's

132
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
It's it's

133
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
I don't know what else to say

134
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
No no no

135
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
Here's what it was

136
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
The issues that I'm

137
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
I'm realizing that

138
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
About a week ago or so

139
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Is it I have an opportunity that's unlike

140
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
An opportunity that will ever come up in my life ever again

141
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
It's an opportunity that most

142
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
People don't

143
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Have ever

144
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,063
Going to Austin on June 15th

145
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,231
Already

146
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
It's terrible

147
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Alright

148
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
It's not that although that is a piece

149
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,591
It's that we've created a thing and people have responded to it in such a way that they've been very supportive

150
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
And I'm able to make my job

151
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Doing this

152
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
I get to live

153
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,271
The life that I desire to live

154
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
I don't have to have a ball

155
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
Anything like that other than

156
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
You know

157
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
Stopping smoking when The Listener say you should stop now

158
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
Jeff

159
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,871
Really want

160
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,271
Live up to the

161
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
I'm starting to record

162
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Recognize and

163
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Appreciate that

164
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
The situation that I'm in

165
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
And made a lot of excuses

166
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
In the past don't fly

167
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
The idea of it like

168
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Oh I don't have time to meditate

169
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:45,215
You know what the fuc why do you don't have to sit on

170
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,823
2 hours of the train to get to and from work at straddle have that can

171
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Oh I don't have time

172
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
Record my dreams what I wake up in the morning and ordered it

173
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
Advanced dream recalls so I can get back to the days when I

174
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
Used to be able to lucid dream

175
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Alright. Making

176
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
I don't have the time to

177
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Stop smoking

178
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Aldi's

179
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
All these things

180
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Aspired to whether it's

181
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Take time or effort

182
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
I have the ability to do those things

183
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
It'll be disrespectful to myself

184
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Everybody

185
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
We're all watching you grow as a person

186
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
Beautiful

187
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,943
Beautiful

188
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
I'm lighting two cigarettes for you

189
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Heroin

190
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
I got to go

191
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279

00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,959
Jordan let's get this started out of

193
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
Text dropped from

194
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Today's episode

195
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Alright alright

196
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Alright

197
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Amp

198
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
Alright alright of us for this episode

199
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Oh man

200
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
This is

201
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,887
Comment on the our Facebook group

202
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
Go home

203
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Brilliant

204
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
I've listened to hundreds of episodes of Alex Jones

205
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
The show I've never heard any

206
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Notion

207
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
There's something that happens on this episode

208
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
That is

209
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
The real on the level that

210
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
Is not to be believed

211
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
And once I explain why it makes sense

212
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
It does make

213
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
What he says

214
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
No he's crazy

215
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Black fox

216
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
Looks like it's just take a snap

217
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
Shot of what happens on this episode

218
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
You'd be like

219
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Well I'll be damned

220
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
You be very confused

221
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Put on closer analysis

222
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Baymax totals

223
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Alright

224
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
We have a bit of rhetoric.

225
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
Get through before we leave

226
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
More lies

227
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
You take the bag

228
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
What do you have last year

229
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Spoiler alert

230
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Involved

231
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Krs-1 is back

232
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
It's not okay

233
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
It's about

234
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Very different

235
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
First ever going to listen to

236
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
But Alex says which is

237
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Yo it's fun to

238
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
Check in on that a little bit

239
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
Here's the first one he's rambling about how

240
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
The globalist world for robots

241
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
The future that's being built

242
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Robot

243
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Shut up

244
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Where is a post

245
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Human

246
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Global

247
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Compaq

248
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
The Fortune 100

249
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,743
Has warned you about nope

250
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Nope

251
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
It's what the Unabomber it was in the MKUltra

252
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Mind control programs volunteer

253
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,335
FedEx

254
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Call the revolution against

255
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
Technology

256
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Emily closet

257
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
There's

258
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Reclassification

259
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
Of the CIA rondomedia

260
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
Asian

261
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
Conspiracy theory

262
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
I thought we should show all this for people

263
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Right now

264
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
He was making all this

265
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
I was going to say that seems a little redundant

266
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,487
The plan

267
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Eteri

268
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
If you know and bold plan

269
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Verbally

270
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
But on the page get it

271
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
This is something

272
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
I'm talking about being like this

273
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Just been to class

274
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Trump didn't release most

275
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
The JFK

276
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
He did

277
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Involve this

278
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Set all like

279
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
And we've already had the planetary plan for a long time

280
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,999
Interplanetary plan

281
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
This is the reason

282
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
So this is a common argument

283
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
Conspiracy theorist

284
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,263
CIA either created or popularized or redefined

285
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
I'm confused

286
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,431
There are a lot of whores there I got to be literally anything

287
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
Probably

288
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,255
Where each of those

289
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,375
School of thought there's this school of thought whatever

290
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
Aluminum foil

291
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
This was all in the wake of the jfkfc

292
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
The reason

293
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
In order to discredit anyone

294
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Disagree with the findings

295
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
Almost uniformly they point to CIA document

296
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,879
Dispatch 1035 Dash 960

297
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
Which is released as part of the question

298
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
1076

299
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
Made by the New York Times

300
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
It does include the work

301
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
It does suggest ways

302
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
The folks

303
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Conspiracies

304
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
About Oswald

305
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
But a close reading

306
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Not reveal that it says that we should quote

307
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Make the

308
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Conspiracy theorist popular in order to discredit critics

309
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Which is the allegation

310
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Child are called Atkins

311
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
So this

312
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
It's just something that people are taken out of a tax

313
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Cleon Warren

314
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
This is

315
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
Could you read the dispatch

316
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
It's very clearly a document

317
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
I meant for non-domestic

318
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Accused

319
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Which is with the CIA

320
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,527
And based on what is in this document

321
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
You'd really

322
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Have to be

323
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
Kind of dumb or intentionally obtuse to not recognize that this is about 4 in

324
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
Guess what like that

325
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,071
That's where we live

326
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Acknowledge

327
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Are we are really important

328
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Quotes from that should be

329
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Pretty illuminate

330
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
What this is about

331
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,567
Of such seriousness

332
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
Affects only the individual concerned

333
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
But also the whole reputation of the American gov

334
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
American government

335
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Being reflect

336
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
In the eyes of foreign

337
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
Where possible

338
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Counter speculation by encouraging referee

339
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Conditions report

340
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Itself

341
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
Where possible

342
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Counter speculation by encouraging reference

343
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
The commission's report

344
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Open-minded foreign readers

345
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,239
Should still be impressed by the care thoroughness

346
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
Objectivity of speed with which

347
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Mission work

348
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,895
Put it in a manual possible

349
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
.2 proof

350
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,503
Yeah exactly what we have.

351
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Speculation

352
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Point

353
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
Primary sources

354
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Some attempt to

355
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Did the u.s. government

356
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
In foreign country

357
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Which falls under the

358
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
CIA perv

359
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Whether you disagree with them existing

360
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
In the first place or not

361
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
I think there's an interesting argument

362
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
You could have

363
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
They're in there

364
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Realm

365
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
What's important the scope of practice

366
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
The nearest it existed in its current form

367
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
Something absurd like 880 or something like that would be great

368
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
Under that lease right now

369
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Oxford English Dictionary

370
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
The earliest reference

371
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
Can Liars earliest reference listed in there is 18

372
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Okay

373
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
The CIA was formed in 1947 so that makes

374
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
The idea that they created

375
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
Popularized

376
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
Again seems impossible

377
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
I'm going back to the late 1800s

378
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
I've been using such diverse settings

379
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Theosophical journals

380
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
Brother talking about Helena blavatsky

381
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Is that being a

382
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Conspiracy

383
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
The popularly known widely used term for over

384
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
It was the same

385
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,615
Used whatever the rich people try to assassinate

386
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
Yeah I prefer

387
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Alex

388
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
At this point if I ever had an argument

389
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Operation Mockingbird

390
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Alright

391
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
Let's Get It On operation Mockingbird

392
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
I understand

393
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
You believe that operation Mockingbird is about to

394
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
CIA taking over the midianite

395
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,543
But unfortunately that is not what it was

396
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,871
A 2007 report called Family Jewels

397
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Was decline

398
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,503
Yeah

399
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,575
The CIA had done that would probably be considered illegal

400
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
In the report there was mention of

401
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
Project Mockingbird which was described as.

402
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
Project Mockingbird a telephone intercept activity was conducted

403
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Queen 12th of March

404
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
3

405
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
And 15th of June 19th

406
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
53

407
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,799
Hampton Bays newsman who at the time had been publishing news articles based on

408
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,127
And frequently quoted classified materials of this agency

409
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
And others

410
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Top secret and special intelligence

411
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Trying to answer

412
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
How they had top-secret Intel

413
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
This makes the name of the operation

414
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Mockingbirds are primarily known for

415
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Just at the CIA

416
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Reason to believe

417
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
These journalists

418
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
And information

419
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
So

420
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
Alex was actually talking about

421
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Horrible expose on that

422
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
That just Monster attic

423
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:09,503
Emporium

424
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Give a smoke

425
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
F****** stupid of me

426
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Figurin say

427
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,680
The CIA doesn't have relationships

428
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,288
All I'm saying is

429
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Yelling

430
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
Project Mockingbird and s***

431
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,640
That doesn't match up with reality

432
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
So

433
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,064
The CIA has him repeating something before that without actually knowing what he's talking about

434
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
Perfectly committee

435
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
76

436
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Laid out most

437
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,864
They maintain the network of several hundred foreigners who they used to

438
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Of foreign countries

439
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,752
Which again I'm not into

440
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
But it is what they are for

441
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
I don't know

442
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:15,040
So in this in this situation it's less like the crafted more like they're running PR

443
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Propaganda

444
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Foreign propaganda

445
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,720
Respectful to the people of those countries but whatever

446
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Iowa

447
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
They also found

448
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Approximately

449
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
The agency

450
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,656
These assets are individual American journalists or employees

451
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
The US media organization

452
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
But it's important

453
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
Consider the context

454
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Comes later

455
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
In the document

456
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,712
Bring up is that about half of those people are actually employees

457
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Media companies are freelance

458
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Alright

459
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
Article 2 hours

460
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
But also this is

461
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Is super important

462
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,256
More than a dozen United States news organizations

463
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,304
And Commercial

464
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Publishing houses

465
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,888
Formerly provided cover for CIA agent

466
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Abroad

467
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
A few of these organizations were unaware that they provided

468
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Discover

469
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
A lot of the intersection

470
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
To the CIA and the media is this

471
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
CIA using me

472
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Media organization

473
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
His unwitting cover stories for their ages

474
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,992
Either way this is far more complicated than sayings

475
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Took over

476
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:26,208
Operating

477
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Plain Sight music

478
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Protect themselves

479
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
Hip

480
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:35,168
Overlapping

481
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
The CIA trying to

482
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,240
Infiltrate the media in order to

483
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Put stories

484
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Through that serves their

485
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Domestically

486
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Or it could be

487
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
I get a job I worked with

488
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
CIA I get a job with Time Magazine

489
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
In order for it to make sense

490
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
For me to be overseas

491
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
Navigation no one

492
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Gets really

493
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Suspicious about it because I work

494
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,952
Overtime

495
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,096
This doesn't bother me so much because I would prefer

496
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
There are still spot

497
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Lego

498
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,640
With no States like nobody is going to win or lose it's just

499
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:23,040
Ocean's 11 spy craft fair

500
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,392
The world is more fun place

501
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Rifling through

502
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
Through trash trying to find Denny's ism

503
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Documents or whatever

504
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,048
A smash-and-grab job

505
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Is no fun

506
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
Nautilus

507
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,504
Create or popularize or telemedia to use

508
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
That's all load of horseshit

509
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
Dispatch document to use

510
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
To say that it means anything

511
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
It's all its I hate

512
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Torture as

513
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
The director

514
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,104
That would be like not appointed Oliver North

515
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,688
To be the head of the NRA

516
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
Meet I have to sit here and explain like

517
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
You're not bad on this one

518
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,624
You're wrong about that

519
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,816
Yeah I am pretty pretentious

520
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
The things because

521
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
The CIA does

522
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,544
To dislike me CIA because they can't be like

523
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,408
We love the CIA

524
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,944
That's a good point

525
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
Ime Nelson talked about it lately

526
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
But he has been

527
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
Pretty consistent generally over

528
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
He's also dumb

529
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Real dumb

530
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:14,400
But make no mistake

531
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,728
Being indicted for multiple felony counts of rape

532
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
Sexual abuse

533
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Torture basically

534
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,592
That's all because of

535
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
Hollywood to the bully

536
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
Donald John Trump

537
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
From CIA MI6

538
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Army

539
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
After

540
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Sex trafficking

541
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,288
He just talked about this earlier

542
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
I Hold On

543
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Not just the gardener ride

544
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,968
Weinstein on the plane

545
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Express

546
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,976
What has been convicted of trafficking young girls to his

547
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,792
She's trying to come up with the name Jeffrey Epstein

548
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
But he can't come up

549
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Because you just

550
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
Why isn't why isn't pulling Allison Mack

551
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:30,176
He does bring it up later but he says like I know you absolute

552
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Lilly did not son-of-a-b****

553
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
Based on this clip and the insane

554
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
Insane thing that you just said

555
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,744
Way he might be correct

556
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
No yes no yes

557
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Alright

558
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
So

559
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
By electing Donald Trump

560
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Women realize

561
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
F****** no one's come

562
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
So we might as well have two

563
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:59,872
Do this s*** ourselves

564
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,016
It's not like Trump helped it is but he's caused it

565
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,576
With his evil evil evil

566
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,976
We have a lot to get

567
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,120
I find a lot of that

568
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Be pretty on taste

569
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,472
Compelling of but also

570
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
I think that you know there are people who

571
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Tried to speak up about it before and were threatened by Mossad agent

572
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,712
Victor your Weinstein and hired a chick like that

573
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Yeah so there's like

574
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:43,136
View spying on people and stalking them and s*** like that

575
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,536
Bring up heavy always talks about how Clinton was on

576
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,608
With Epstein body

577
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,192
I realize we never actually really disgusting

578
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,216
The details of it

579
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Went and looked it up

580
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
I looked into it I researched this

581
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,872
Little bit about the friendship

582
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
Donald Trump

583
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920

This is from the New York Magazine article called Jeffrey Epstein International Money Man of Mystery

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,384
It's far from energetic

594
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432

He likes beautiful women as much as I do

602
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
It's even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side

603
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
No doubt about it

604
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,320

605
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344

He's a pedophile

607
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,400
I am not going to say something incriminating right now

Like if you can steal somebody's house because somebody had some weed in there

697
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
If

Don't worry about it I've got you covered all right

779
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,504
I looked at it as I search the entirety breitbart's back catalog can only find one article

780
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
It's relevant at all to the

781
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
The topic today

782
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Talking about

783
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600

26

787
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Not 2017

788
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Funny wieners laugh

789
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,656
Revealing maybe there are inside forces

790
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Involved

791
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,472
2 / dramaticized

792
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
In order to force

793
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,408
Applications that article and read

794
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,736
Slimy piece of s*** he is he's a f******

795
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
Garbage man

796
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Kind of sound

797
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
True like listen to this

798
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,744
Weiner and Huma Aberdeen his wife the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years have both

799
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,512
Flipped

800
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
Like you saying s*** like that that didn't happen

801
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
He's lying he's creating a false reality

802
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:12,032
Anyway he is a man who never was never born with a heart and where his brain is supposed

803
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
To be there is a garbage bag filled with

804
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
Also in other news

805
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,040
Donald Trump got played like a pro by North Korea

806
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
You didn't understand that

807
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
The new Clear Eyes

808
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,464
Unilateral disarmament

809
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,560
Current never have currently there's a better chance of North Korea becoming

810
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,120
A better Ally to South Korea than us

811
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
Entirely possible

812
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,496
South Korea's in like 2 seconds

813
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:47,360
Maybe the reason that we've been fighting this long is because America's f****** garbage

814
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Are they the ones

815
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,040
Maybe we should be more like

816
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,136
That's really the only way for them to stay safe

817
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Is Sturgis

818
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
Bail on America and be like

819
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,280

820
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
So drunk that really Patty and decided

821
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,168
Cancel

822
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:14,496
Himself and Kim Jeong Hoon hilarious

823
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
Summit

824
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,648
Do the John Bolton

825
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
That's interesting I mean blow up the pump

826
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
Nuclear testing site

827
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
Look and confirm whether or not that destroyed their nuclear

828
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
But here's the thing

829
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
Where's that reason and others

830
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
It's absurd to say that this is a victory

831
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,783
To you from an article in the independent

832
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,343
From an article that came out on November 2nd

833
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
In 2070

834
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
A report that North Korea's nuclear testing

835
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Spheres of the major radiation

836
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,327
At least 100 workers at the Geary

837
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,911
Nuclear site are feared to have died in the accident that happened around

838
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
10th of September

839
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
Following tourism 6

840
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
Atomic test

841
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Earlier that

842
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
Japanese broadcaster TV

843
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,359
Asahi reported

844
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,431
Then go a little bit further into the future

845
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
A visit from CNN

846
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:32,831
North Korea announced on April 20th that the country had quote realize nuclear weaponization

847
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
I would no longer need to test nuclear weapons

848
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:38,463
To demonstrate its commitment it said it would destroy the nuclear test

849
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:43,583
No weapons inspectors or nonproliferation experts were invited to witness the event of the

850
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,375
Destruction that happened a couple of days ago

851
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
Here in present day

852
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
It was unclear whether the explosion

853
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,519
Brenda tunnel inoperable or only cause limited damage

854
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,615
Before Thursday's explosions experts had warned that the total Destruction

855
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
Destroy valuable evidence

856
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
The state of North Korea

857
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Programs

858
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
Examples

859
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,087
As well as radiation counters to assess the levels in the atmosphere

860
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:09,695
Turn off two attempted to take radiation measuring equipment to North Korea said it was

861
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Also

862
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
We have no idea if that was their only nuclear test

863
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,095
We don't have any really solid until the

864
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Since about what they're up to

865
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
So celebrate

866
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Foolish

867
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:29,151
I think I think maybe we're only at put up a banner that says mission accomplished levels it could

868
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,991
Birmingham

869
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
I'm sorry I'm rushing through

870
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Some of the stuff because

871
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
I do think it's important to deal with the narratives that he has

872
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
But we do also need a good chunk

873
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Go time to go over

874
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:49,631
Most important part which is the interview that we're about to get to but for now we have to listen to this

875
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
And this is Alex lying about

876
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,663
Democratically

877
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
15 months ago

878
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Point of order

879
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
Don't think about it

880
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
He said quote

881
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
Alex

882
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
Clearly

883
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
He didn't say that

884
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,271
Responded to Trump's threats to impose heavily

885
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
Tariffs on steel and aluminum

886
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Imported

887
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
This would have been

888
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,391
Majorly

889
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Disruptive dominions

890
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,023
Streets after the German auto manufacturing industry represents about a fifth of the country's export

891
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,071
What Yonkers said was

892
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:51,839
Quote

893
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,631
We will continue our negotiations

894
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,191
The United States but we refused to negotiate under

895
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,823
So in response to Trump's proposal some people in the EU started preparing for a trade War

896
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,359
From the Chicago Tribune

897
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Quotes

898
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,943
EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom

899
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Perfect man

900
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,295
Great names for the Maelstrom

901
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831

You are the right person for this

905
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
Really close to maelstrom

906
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,399
Said Wednesday that the EU is circulating among

907
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Hmong member states

The list of u.s. goods to Target

909
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,519
So they can respond as quickly as possible

910
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
The state of trade War

911
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895

This is stupid process

914
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
The fact that we have to do this

915
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
But we have to do it

916
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
We can also do stupid

917
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,487
Little bit of a difference

918
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
What would Alex

919
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,839

Legitimately think that's probably a Freudian slip normally would say is weird

957
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:52,991
Public is going to defeat you

958
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
Whatever it is

959
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
It's about time

960
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,327
Central Time Zone

961
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
Russia will defeat you

962
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,215
Just doesn't feel good doesn't feel good

963
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,615
Problems with us

964
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
Stupid these people

965
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:27,295
Colluding with other foreign powers

966
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:34,719
People are employed with foreign governments

967
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,303
Man do I love this one that seems to hate our country

968
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
Also by the way

969
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,631
I understand why all the

970
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,447
This is happening now piece of information

971
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,263
From 2009 that I think that we have

972
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,847
We got a Smoking Gun

973
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
I don't think Alex is into America

974
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
That's

975
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,927
I don't think Alex likes America

976
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,279
At least we agree on something and I think that's why you likes Rush

977
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
I don't like America either

978
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,079
Everything is

979
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,359
REI

980
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
But I don't know how to I don't know how to say this

981
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,271
Things it's very consistent

982
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
He's a bigot

983
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
And I hear you

984
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
Being thrown out of movie quote

985
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
It might not be working

986
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:58,175
Allied with a 1.1.3

987
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
Years ago

988
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
It's insane

989
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Most important

990
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Smooth

991
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
Smooth smooth smooth

992
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Muslims are

993
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:36,831
Increasing by 500% every 3 years or 100

994
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:41,183
1.8 + 500 million

995
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Yeah

996
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Wait no

997
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:53,471
I'm profoundly unmoved by these demographic

998
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
At that rate

999
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
In only 30 years

1000
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,591
Everyone on the planet will be abuzz

1001
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
I don't care

1002
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,687
I learned something that you should care

1003
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,759
Wanted like you know

1004
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,343
Let's say there's climate change and then there's

1005
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
A lot of Isla

1006
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
Those are the two things

1007
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,487
Worry about right now

1008
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,791
Not going to lie

1009
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
The entire planet

1010
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:28,799
That's too much must I agree with you that's the one time I will admit

1011
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
There's too many

1012
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,639
I agree with you on that but I would also say that like

1013
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,735
A lot of the versions of Christianity that are around right now I don't want

1014
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,807
I want any more of them are already

1015
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,647
I don't want more of the Christianity that existed let's play

1016
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:47,743
Hundred years ago whatever you do like I don't

1017
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,279
I don't think that's great

1018
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:56,191
I think we all have a long ways to go in terms of becoming the ideal people that we want to be whether Christian Muslim

1019
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Atheistic

1020
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Secluded

1021
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
I believe it's 75 or 80 per-cent of Evangelical

1022
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,967
Do Christians really support what Isis doing right now so

1023
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,039
So I don't like I don't like Christianity

1024
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Not great

1025
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
The other thing Tuesday like as well although I will admit Christ did say in Matthew 10

1026
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
11

1027
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Get them f****** out of here

1028
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:26,655
I grew up my dad's a religious studies professor and as such I grew up around

1029
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
People of different faiths and different

1030
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,495
Cultural heritage is in like right

1031
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Globalist

1032
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
You sure I go to the mosque

1033
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
In town from time to time

1034
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
I knew Muslim kids

1035
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Growing up

1036
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,527
I don't know if we had any in Columbia

1037
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
I really had to of but I was unaware of them

1038
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
They must have they didn't tell me about it

1039
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
It's where the Muslim

1040
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,047
The reason I bring this up is but like

1041
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,399
Childhood and throughout my formative years I could very

1042
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,935
Easily imagine myself

1043
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Dating

1044
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Someone

1045
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
From like a muzzle

1046
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
I could see myself marrying that person

1047
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,639
See myself having kids with them

1048
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Event

1049
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
What

1050
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Vismai

1051
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:15,039
Kid any less my identity

1052
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
Culture

1053
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,351
Natural disaster demographic shifting or so

1054
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Something like that

1055
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Is

1056
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Zoe's

1057
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:37,055
Because it's the exact opposite of America the entire history

1058
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,615
America is

1059
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
Doesn't matter where you come from

1060
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,735
You get folded into our culture and our culture

1061
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,807
Becomes better Ford and

1062
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:55,231
F****** like our culture gif

1063
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,887
In-country culture doesn't go anywhere all culture only get

1064
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,471
Bigger and more beautiful

1065
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:10,591
It's a trade that we do it's like you come here and we all absorb into America

1066
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
And then what you get

1067
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
Play The Promise

1068
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,223
From that is that we will also celebrate your culture

1069
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
Book value whatever you have

1070
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,087
And you've brought to the table

1071
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,159
And that's just that's something that to demographic

1072
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,463
Cliff numbers and all this b*******

1073
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,791
Stupid it's a part of the

1074
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,863
The social contract that I think America has lost its way on

1075
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
A little bit

1076
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Islamic culture

1077
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:45,151
He's also been built

1078
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
America's garbage

1079
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,599
America created Erik Prince

1080
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
We're back

1081
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
There's old like you

1082
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
There's

1083
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,231
Cultures that we just have

1084
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
Left

1085
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:00,767
Hanging

1086
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
Finish the high-five with

1087
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,983
I would probably save the very first one that was in America

1088
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,335
Closer you are or further away you are from

1089
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
Visual eBay

1090
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,431
The last chance you have of America

1091
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,223
Celebrating your culture in a

1092
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Right because I guess

1093
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
I got I mean like

1094
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,391
People do celebrate Cinco de Mayo

1095
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
Wrongly

1096
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,487
Autocorrect

1097
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,815
Not go any further with this thought just to save it

1098
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
This is stupid

1099
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
I hate I hate the idea that Alex

1100
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
Muslims and I also hate that

1101
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
That is somehow

1102
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Game over

1103
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
That's

1104
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,175
America has backup of

1105
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
Against the wall

1106
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:56,831
How's the talk about it

1107
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
But alright

1108
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,719
Now we are facing

1109
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
As American

1110
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
Socialist

1111
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,119

1113
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,959
Famous country

1114
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
They're up against

1115
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,287
Everything

1116
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:22,943
They are winning

1117
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
They're making all this

1118
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Ridiculous

1119
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,695
You don't want to miss

1120
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
I'm greasy

1121
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
And believe me

1122
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:43,935
This individual was one of the biggest news stories this week

1123
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
I think I'll tell you at

1124
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Start

1125
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Of the next hour

1126
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
He will then be in studio

1127
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
Very

1128
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Excited

1129
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
About this

1130
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,855
Attracted

1131
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
The guy

1132
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
She's not from Austin

1133
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,327
Any idea who he's talking about

1134
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
Flying down here

1135
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Not from Austin

1136
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Not for me

1137
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,407
Heroes who protected the teacher

1138
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175

1140
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,759
In our other mass shooting

1141
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,415
It's not that it's not

1142
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,607
No he actually does pay the color Kaepernick's a little loser on this episode

1143
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,655
You know who is that

1144
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
Alex's death

1145
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,775
He's the fella who got

1146
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
Evicted

1147
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,663
Videos

1148
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Discussion

1149
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
Free Speech lawyers in country

1150
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
Jaundice

1151
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Is happening

1152
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:25,823

1153
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,687
Nah not clicking Miss no no

1154
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Don't need to know it

1155
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
Doesn't matter

1156
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
All right so why did he get evicted

1157
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,719
To leave

1158
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,487
Kennywood

1159
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
He's 30

1160
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,583
They gave him notice

1161
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,887
A bunch of times and try to get

1162
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
I did not realize that

1163
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,311
Where my parents are my friends are like you got to go I'd be like s*** I guess I have

1164
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
To go I didn't realize you could just be like

1165
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063
Still living together while they were

1166
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,135
Stick it up

1167
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,463
Turn this country to the Gravel Pit look here's the thing

1168
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,767
Fixing media I think is being derelict

1169
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:20,607
Give its Duty there's a couple places that I've seen that reported this well

1170
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
Other people have not

1171
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
A lot of people are reporting this as like

1172
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:31,103
This guy is a representation of the Millennials and they're entitled and pick they deserve

1173
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Is crazy

1174
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:41,343
Crazy cuz if somehow like did he doesn't belong

1175
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,183
Conservative in his own reporting

1176
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
But she doesn't belong

1177
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,607
Sadie's crazy cuz that's like judging mental illness and what have you put

1178
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,143
He is mentally ill

1179
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,727
He is someone who and also is a

1180
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Buckhead

1181
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:04,895
Much bigger issues to deal with him like he's some sort of a Healer

1182
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:10,015
Serious look at this f****** loser what is doing a disservice to

1183
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,575
To the truth it's doing a disservice to this

1184
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,623
It's really insulting to this guy's parents

1185
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
Who we don't really know what their position on it is

1186
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,487
Because they've been trying to stay out of the

1187
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
Spotlight

1188
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,559
They don't want to deal with

1189
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
This being a media Zoo

1190
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
They probably don't want their

1191
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Kid to have to

1192
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
To deal with that either

1193
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495
Although he's courting the Press

1194
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,359
Yeah and

1195
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
Until like the various aspects

1196
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
But this story really really

1197
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Really trouble

1198
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,759
And the idea that Alex

1199
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,295
Has him on

1200
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,575
And behaves the way he does

1201
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
God dammit

1202
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,415
This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life

1203
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,743
This is one of the weirdest things I've ever seen on Alex's show

1204
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
F****** with

1205
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,423
If this turns out to be a weird dad pivot for

1206
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,823
Bunker's what you can hide from your parents while living under these their basement I'm going to f****** lose my mind

1207
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,639
That would be

1208
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
Pivot of all time

1209
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
But

1210
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,015
Before we get there we got to listen to

1211
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
2

1212
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
This guy Marquan.

1213
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
Who's a lawyer

1214
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,255
C'Mon mostly just to talk about all the lawsuits against

1215
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,655
Free legal advice

1216
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:34,239
Like reassurance but you're right

1217
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
I guess

1218
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
At the end actually I was like

1219
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
I'm thinking about countersuing

1220
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,127
Let me know if you want to

1221
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,919
Explorer slapback provisions

1222
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
I never tell people.

1223
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
You have to understand what

1224
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
He's doing is like

1225
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
I was like

1226
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Should I

1227
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,415

But it turns out that is also a

1231
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Buckhead

1232
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
The second guy in

1233
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
2 minutes

1234
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
Hookah

1235
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
This guy belongs

1236
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
This isn't a conversation

1237
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,311
About one of the top free speech lawyers out there

1238
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
I mean is right to say whatever you want but

1239
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
Buckhead

1240
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
This guy

1241
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:18,271
This is a conversation about

1242
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
Philip Morgan

1243
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599

When's enough

1245
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,327
When what number of

1246
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:36,447
Hugely powerful men do we need to get confirmation where monsters before were like

1247
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,007
I think we can trust the me-too

1248
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,543
Book for the

1249
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567

It's this

1252
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,039
Contingent of a very

1253
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,319
Small group of people

1254
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
Really

1255
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879

Sorry if it hasn't already

1263
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,407
We got to be

1264
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Worried about this

1265
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,135

Fifty Shades of Grey is wife sure

1271
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,559

This guy sounds like everybody on Infowars

1273
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,935

Everything is about power and domination

The other way around

1291
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295

1331
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:56,543
And how it f*** you over pull a card that says

1332
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,103
I was born black in America

1333
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,063
Succeed by Lake somehow that makes it easier

1334
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Whatever

1335
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,559
The only people who would ever subscribe to that is people who are on

1336
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Highest level

1337
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,887
Abuse of social hierarchy

1338
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
The victim Olympics

1339
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,775
And you are

1340
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
Calling yourself a victim

1341
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
Somewhat yeah

1342
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
Because you're not

1343
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,711
Victim

1344
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:42,111
I don't get to taste like I get everything and you guys are joking

1345
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:46,719
Cards

1346
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,303
All have negative values on it and you're mad you don't get the pole card

1347
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:55,167
Lockhome down

1348
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
Left to get through

1349
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,799
You're going to enjoy every minute of this I think

1350
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
The first clip is the longest one

1351
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,383
But it's

1352
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
It's worth it

1353
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
This might be a Mite downpipe as we meet

1354
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
330 year old

1355
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,391
Whose parents still waiting for this

1356
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,999
Name is Michael Rotondo

1357
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,351
Michael Rotondo not March

1358
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:30,751
30 year old put on a wig

1359
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
How's it going to be clear

1360
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:48,415
Can you put ear keep your ears open to see if you can tell what Alex realizes

1361
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,951
This is a bad idea

1362
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,143
It's exciting it stop

1363
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,471
I was just too

1364
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,775
What I asked for what

1365
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
Believe

1366
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Justice to be

1367
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,615
I didn't really want

1368
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
To have

1369
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,223
How to turn into a media thing

1370
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
It's fine I understand

1371
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
30 year old man

1372
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
A crazy person

1373
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,071
I think you're

1374
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,911
But everybody's a little quirky ways

1375
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:35,775
Get you on here and be mean to you know that

1376
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
Because

1377
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,455
Welfare and

1378
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,503
Abortion

1379
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
Search engine

1380
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,319
Level above

1381
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,647
Are they

1382
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
California

1383
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,847
The conservative media

1384
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,919
I called you a bomb and I'm going to add a joke

1385
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,479
A slob and a delusional

1386
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Which

1387
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,183
That makes all of us

1388
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,279
But all these other people are entitled

1389
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
Real quick

1390
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,887
Listen

1391
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,447
Rotondo response

1392
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:42,847
And listen to Alex's response to his response has made

1393
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,407
Then all the s*** that he just said

1394
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:53,855
Everyone's saying that you suck if you're a piece of s*** someone else

1395
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:58,719
Yeah but everybody

1396
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:07,423
But at least you're not one of these welfare Queen's Right

1397
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:13,823
He's pissed off that we have to pay for illegal immigrant abortions in at the same time is pissed off that illegal immigrants are have

1398
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591
Anchor baby

1399
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
Also you don't get both

1400
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:23,039
He has a child who he is not allowed

1401
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,087
Be in contact with Progressive something

1402
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
Right

1403
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
He claims it's because he's

1404
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,231
Stupor

1405
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
Right

1406
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
I don't think

1407
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
It happens a lot

1408
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
I halfway believe it in this

1409
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
In the stupid f******

1410
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Country

1411
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,959
Nothing else I don't I don't believe it

1412
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
It made his

1413
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,383
His baby's mother

1414
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
Say hey we got to go to court you can't be around your son

1415
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,551
Trust women

1416
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,367
And you know what do you think that's vert not on

1417
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,391
Some sort of welfare

1418
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,159
Because

1419
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,463
He doesn't have a job and won't work

1420
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,839
She has to take her baby she has to support a child by voice off without

1421
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
The father of the child

1422
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,423
Being able to contribute anything their moms

1423
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:20,639
I don't think he I don't look I don't I don't like the idea of throwing stones and what have you but I will say that

1424
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
If someone is that you know

1425
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,807
That's what I say

1426
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,367
Alex's said it least you're not one of these bum

1427
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,183
Right

1428
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Willy's bombs on welfare

1429
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,023
And here is Rotondo

1430
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Response

1431
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
Would you crazy

1432
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
I think that

1433
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,447
You shouldn't have people who need things like

1434
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,727
And shelter

1435
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,007
And

1436
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Your own communities I don't think it's something that you want

1437
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
I'm sorry

1438
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,783
Even

1439
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,343
Even if it cost more

1440
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:06,463
Get these people food and housing I don't think

1441
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
It's something that you

1442
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,535
Would wish to forego because

1443
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,095
And you have hungry people and asking friends and go up

1444
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
The Nugget

1445
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
That's one of the

1446
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,823
What the f***

1447
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
So Alex

1448
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,175
Alex

1449
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:31,295
It's the only way to combat a lot of that need base crime

1450
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,319
Is by

1451
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
Taking care of those

1452
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
Now there's

1453
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,695
No way possible to take care of those meats

1454
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,743
Everybody knows that's an impossibility

1455
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
What just happened there you have him being like

1456
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,911
You're not a bum cuz you're not on welfare

1457
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Clearly

1458
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,495
Situation where someone

1459
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,311
Needs to be on welfare

1460
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,847
Then he comes

1461
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,383
How does responses like

1462
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:00,479
I think that if people need food or shelter than even if it cost

1463
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,807
More in taxes we need to support that because the alternative

1464
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,855
Is there another probably race

1465
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,647
Time with people not being able to

1466
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:11,231
Sign the Bottom Rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs

1467
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
Alix Bailey

1468
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:18,655
Historically but you are absolutely correct before I left

1469
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,055
I will murder anyone who attempts to help

1470
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,359
Have a professor

1471
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,663
He could have a senator

1472
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:35,551
Look up liberal Progressive Senator on who would make it

1473
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:39,391
StubHub

1474
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:49,631
Sorry this week why is he allowing him to make

1475
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,031
He doesn't know what's going on

1476
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:00,639
This is out of the gate, we have no clue what's going on

1477
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,711
So he's 18 what do you think Alex

1478
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
Was going to happen

1479
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:10,111
That

1480
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:15,487
The twists and turns show you a picture of the

1481
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
The two of them

1482
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,559
I'll post this on our Facebook group

1483
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,375
But I just this really well

1484
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Thumbs up

1485
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,191
How the mood was

1486
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,711
It's Alex with his hands clasped almost praying position

1487
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
Up and into the middle distance

1488
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:42,111
Well the other dude is staring bullets into his ear

1489
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:49,023
Alex

1490
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:49,791
To being

1491
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Servient

1492
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
Ended usually goes through

1493
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,399
Through your parents why is this

1494
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
And say you're the worst person

1495
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,247
Natural ways

1496
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,015
People

1497
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,599
Irani

1498
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:18,463
I would f****** know

1499
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,535
I used to use one of the buildings that he owned as my studio and now

1500
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,375
We have no expertise in the field

1501
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
Department

1502
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:34,591
I think you know a little bit about Pastor dependents

1503
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,383
I would call him

1504
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
6 level bump

1505
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:44,063
Clearly

1506
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:48,415
Becomes clear that Alex

1507
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,951
You could judge

1508
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,351
But you I would never call you a wishlist

1509
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:00,447
Please pizzas yet I would never call you that

1510
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,215
Alyssa

1511
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,007
I'm not saying it's true

1512
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Send a text

1513
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
Viral

1514
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,551
Alright

1515
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
I've been trying to leave the home

1516
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
4 years

1517
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
That

1518
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,031
I felt as though I would

1519
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,359
Which was that

1520
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Chase

1521
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,919
Okay tomatoes for 6 months

1522
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:47,807
Because that was what I don't want to make

1523
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343
And take care of me

1524
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
No

1525
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:02,655
What did you have that handy

1526
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,215
Don't freak out using her phone

1527
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,567
I don't I don't

1528
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:14,943
Particularly care I love the way that Alex is so disarmed by this guy

1529
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,991
Weird that he's like

1530
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,391
The thing that I claimed isn't true then I will accept it

1531
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
Somehow I'm cool with it

1532
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
Did you see that need like

1533
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
Particularly

1534
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
Care

1535
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,703
About the specifics

1536
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,519
Cuz I'm in the same camp as you that like

1537
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311
If my parents told me to leave

1538
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
I would leave

1539
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,871
My parents

1540
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,407
Like if I were

1541
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:48,991
19 yeah you're right

1542
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
He write sorry

1543
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:51,295
Alright here I go

1544
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,599
It wouldn't take

1545
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,415
Put my little bindal on my shoulder and start walking

1546
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,975
Especially

1547
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,767
If my parents were as

1548
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,815
Gracious and nice as his parents

1549
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,839
Clearly were

1550
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
That I don't think it would

1551
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,423
I don't think it would ever

1552
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Isaac

1553
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,543
I think that this state of affairs that we're in

1554
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
In terms of this even being something

1555
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Disgust

1556
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
These tragic

1557
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
I don't think it's

1558
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
Funny I don't think it's fun

1559
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,480
A finger in

1560
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:25,088
I think this is absolutely tragedy

1561
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,392
To baa

1562
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,928
No

1563
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:31,232
Astoria public

1564
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
Clickbait

1565
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:36,096
Stories

1566
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,656
His parents offered him

1567
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,240
Him $1,100 to find his own place

1568
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
In February

1569
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,312
They just gave him 1100

1570
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
Hundred dollars

1571
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,920
He took the money but he used it for quote various other expenses

1572
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
End up moving out of the house

1573
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,320
He claims on Alex Jones the show that he wants to move out and he would have given him

1574
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
Six months notice

1575
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
But that is action

1576
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,904
Don't really seem to it

1577
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
Indicate that

1578
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
But again

1579
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,280
You don't give a s*** for a number of reasons

1580
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
One of them

1581
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
Is that

1582
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,888
Is

1583
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,424
He seems like a dangerous guy

1584
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Oh yeah

1585
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,776
Sorry to hear from the

1586
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,568

What year

1589
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
From the future

1590
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
Years back

1591
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:28,320
Over the past week was arrested outside her window Thursday night

1592
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:33,952
Police say Michael Rotondo 22 years old sent a woman several threatening text messages

1593
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,792
Earlier this week before finally showing up outside her home on Wednesday

1594
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:41,632
The victim called 911 but Rotondo fled before police arrived

1595
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,448
He returned Thursday night however if police caught him

1596
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Walking around the women's residence

1597
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,032
At about 7:15 p.m.

1598
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:53,152
Counts each of third-degree stalking trespassing and one count of second-degree menacing

1599
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,736
Police say Rotondo was arraigned and sent to county jail on 45

1600
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Hundred dollar cash

1601
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,272
Bail or

1602
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,344
An order of protection was filed

1603
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
And

1604
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,952
Police say Rotondo was ordered to surrender his firearms

1605
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
He had guns

1606
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,048
Grapes

1607
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,608
Temporarily

1608
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
Got his guns back

1609
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,984
God you're not allowed

1610
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,104
Mom was trying to encourage him to move out of the house

1611
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,384
She sent him a note

1612
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,920
We're really speaking

1613
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,688
To each other

1614
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Not at all

1615
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,528
IG suggested that he quotes sell other things

1616
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
Things that have significant value

1617
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,856
Cheerios

1618
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,136
Some tools Etc

1619
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,464
She also says quote

1620
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
Is especially true for any weapons you may have

1621
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,584
You need the money and we'll have no place for the

1622
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
Your compound bow

1623
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,192
What uses recreational

1624
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,496
Lever action 30-30 rifle

1625
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
She says use

1626
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:58,944
So this is a guy who has a small child that he's not taking care of it is not allowed to be in contact with

1627
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,344
For a mysterious case that happened in 2017 we don't have the details on not entirely sure about

1628
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,440
He's been arrested for stalking a woman he was caught outside or f****** window

1629
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,976
Igear's ago

1630
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,304
This is a this is a dangerously Disturbed person

1631
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,328
If you

1632
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
If you even

1633
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:19,680
If you even get a sexual harassment

1634
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:22,496
Complaint filed against you at an office

1635
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,288
You should have your guns remote

1636
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
You should not be

1637
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
You should not be able to have

1638
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:35,808
That's just a anywhere near every time there is any kind of b*******

1639
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,880
There's also a history of domestic violence

1640
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,464
Or violent towards women always f****** there

1641
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
It's always

1642
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,048
Beer that

1643
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,072
You don't get done

1644
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,352
In this case

1645
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,656
Especially we have a situation where this guy is being

1646
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Thrust into

1647
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,312
The spotlight way more emotionally able to handle

1648
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
His parents house

1649
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,104
The place

1650
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,504
Seemed at least like a safe haven for him he's not allowed to contact his child he has a history of stalking women

1651
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
How's it going

1652
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:13,184
All of it if anything happens in the near future where he kills somebody no one should be surprised

1653
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,464
That's not to say he will

1654
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,000
I'm not saying that

1655
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
Boy those signs are all there

1656
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:25,728
And everybody in the media

1657
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,032
Part of the problem

1658
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,360
Can carbon illustrate even further a pattern of sort of resentment

1659
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Towards women

1660
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
I would like to play

1661
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,968
Switch to the fact that in May 2017

1662
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,992
Best Buy

1663
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,344
Because he fired him for not coming into work when he was scheduled for the weekend

1664
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,696
He claims that he had an agreement with management that he could spend

1665
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,768
Time with his kids have to work on weekends

1666
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,584
And that female employees were given more latitude

1667
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,632
BestBuy completely disagrees

1668
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
Himself in court pro se

1669
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,264
And I've looked into some of that

1670
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:10,784
I'm fine

1671
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,344
Anyway

1672
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
That's why

1673
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,184
Is just to say

1674
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,256
That's why it makes sense he's on Infowars

1675
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:25,888
He has the cutout in the profile of a domestic terrorist

1676
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,936
I'm waiting for the storm front

1677
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,728
Reddit page or whatever it is

1678
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,800
His handle on Stormfront

1679
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,592
I need to move out like

1680
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
F******

1681
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
We're not nearly done

1682
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:47,392
I did this all one-dimensional

1683
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,696
Exhaustion

1684
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,256
Did your face you're just being honest

1685
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,816
Because I want to have a man-to-man talk with you

1686
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Okay

1687
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,224
Deschutes and do the report

1688
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
How to say it

1689
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,440
We could turn you into a

1690
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,848
Iceborne DLC my son

1691
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
You're not allowed to

1692
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,736
Is Alex secretly his dad

1693
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:51,392
Black Alex is secretly his dad touched on

1694
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,464
What I'm trying to flesh out as this goes along

1695
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Alex wants

1696
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
To be his dad

1697
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Wow

1698
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:04,448

01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,576
He should be in a hospital

1714

But it's not a psychological

1803
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,472
This is not a situation where he wants to be around his parents

1804
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,800
He said quote the deaf people who don't know sign language

1805
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,616
That's how he described the relationship with his parents

1806
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,896
He continues to live under their roof

1807

Then

1812
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,488
He goes into the dining room or up to his bedroom

1813
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,304
So it's not

1814
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,328

But the idea of actually f******

1860

01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,792
Terribly wrong in your life

Whatever

1885
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,512
I don't care

1886
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,840
Explain

1887
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,864
So this is

1888
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,144
Liquid Alex

1889
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
Didn't

1890
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
Go outside

1891
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,008
More like

1892
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,128
Continue Alex

1893
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,736
That's why this is so weird

1894
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,528
It leads to

1895
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,600
Worst at Vivid I've ever heard of my life

1896
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
When are you going to get out

1897
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,488
And considering that

1898
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,584
I cannot pull depends on how many hands I have to help me cuz I've had some people offer to help me

1899
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,240
Stuff to 3000

1900
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:23,872
And put them another $1,000

1901
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,504
Myself

1902
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,576
Mercedes

1903
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:37,952
I haven't January 1st

1904
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
June 1st

1905
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,416
44.com

1906
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,696
I need your support

1907
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,488
I need this part cuz I'm in the middle of

1908
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,512
An awful interview

1909
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
This is weird

1910
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:18,400
That little that little bit of like

1911
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,544
We can't be more than three or four hundred dollars is like

1912
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
I can't do that

1913
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
Myself

1914
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,128
That is a man

1915
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,152
With

1916
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:30,432
Genuine

1917
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,248
Mental illness

1918
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,808
Compulsive disorder perhaps

1919
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,600
Nothing

1920
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,904
No absolutely not

1921
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
Up until this point

1922
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
It was like

1923
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:47,072
Listening to that conversation is such

1924
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,376
Listening to a conversation between

1925
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
A dad who has

1926
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,240
Never met his son and the son who is

1927
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,776
Breathing in pain

1928
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,848
Yeah it is

1929
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,128
Very much

1930
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:06,528
Struggling

1931
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,064
Come to its natural conclusion

1932
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,648
Next one cuz it's trying to give

1933
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Career count

1934
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,768
I like to watch

1935
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:22,400
Videos of machines

1936
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,544
What do you look like

1937
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,360
Very reminiscent of my dad telling me to go to

1938
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:36,224
You learn something very sad

1939
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Any friends

1940
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
Sort of

1941
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,304
Go out get out the house yes

1942
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,240
Alright

1943
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:03,104
Computers are allowing people to plug into virtual reality

1944
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Flash

1945
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,160
Lowering

1946
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,464
You're in a mesmerized

1947
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
Come on

1948
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,840
There's a new season of Arrested Development

1949
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,632
You understand

1950
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:36,384
Around the mountain

1951
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:42,784
I don't do things like that

1952
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,536
Exactly

1953
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:57,376
But the point is that

1954
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,424
You need to do

1955
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
I need to

1956
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,288
Run around

1957
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
Yes

1958
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,576
I got it

1959
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
I'm crazy

1960
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:23,488
This is weird

1961
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:27,328
Really f***** up because Alex is

1962
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,912
This is because Alex has checked out he's like

1963
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,960
He offered him a job

1964
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,008
Out the gate right and he was like

1965
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:41,408
I don't know

1966
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:44,480
I'm not good at Grand

1967
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:49,088
I'm not going to use that I'll do that myself

1968
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:54,720
Videos of machines

1969
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:59,584
Yeah I don't think I want to do that too monotonous and then

1970
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,424
Pizza place offered a job

1971
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:09,568
Jubilate to that someone told me about it I didn't see it

1972
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,672
18 ft so weird because I

1973
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,696
Guarantee

1974
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:30,304
This is the exact same conversation this guy's head with his real dad

1975
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:36,704
Undoubtedly

1976
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:45,408
The only way to get what it's about 30°

1977
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,944
That's what I do for fun

1978
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:52,064
Hangout in my Mansion watching Netflix

1979
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,392
Netflix

1980
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,696
Great so famously

1981
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,352
About Netflix and

1982
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,632
Euphemism

1983
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
Blown up in my face a little bit

1984
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,616
I smell the internet making fun of

1985
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,384
Breath

1986
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,200
He realizes like

1987
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:21,248
I'm not doing a great job here

1988
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,856
Maybe I should bring in my other surrogates on Owen Shroyer

1989
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:29,696
This happened to help me insult this kid

1990
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:40,960
Immediately after

1991
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:45,056
Next to you

1992
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,736
This guy is the future right here

1993
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:59,392
Serious

1994
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,024
What you got to do

1995
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:07,584
It sounds like a

1996
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:13,728
That

1997
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:17,568
Another Star Wars

1998
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
No

1999
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Okay

2000
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,440
I don't know what that is

2001
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
Other wife

2002
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,448
Okay actress hilarious

2003
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:47,264
A Pepsi with a comic genius

2004
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,056
You know that

2005
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:57,248
Best you can be out there and we're going to leave that hang

2006
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,808
That's one of the worst

2007
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
I've ever seen

2008
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Like

2009
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,392
That's a two-man Act

2010
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,952
Will never have night too

2011
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
He's like

2012
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,864
Palpatine is my spirit animal

2013
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,888
I don't know what that mean

2014
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
I thought you weren't awake

2015
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:21,568
It's a joke

2016
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,616
This is this is

2017
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,944
But no instead of Yes Man

2018
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,736
There's no but you can

2019
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:34,368
Just you can not really Star Wars

2020
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,928
Alex's misery

2021
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
Keeps trying to be like

2022
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,072
What

2023
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,400
Why don't you want to leave your parents house like I do

2024
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:48,192
I want move out right I want

2025
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:51,264
Little more time

2026
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
I don't believe

2027
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,824
That argument on his part

2028
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,104
Hugh

2029
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,736
I believe I believe he wants to leave

2030
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:05,856
Absolutely fundamentally cannot because

2031
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:08,928
If you had six months you would be able to

2032
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:11,488
Course he's not he's probably thought that for 6

2033
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,120
But all that stuff is like you're never going to penetrate into that mindset

2034
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,448
Do you want to stay at home

2035
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,728
Easy question for him to answer

2036
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,336
It's almost like there should be some sort of

2037
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,360
Profession

2038
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:31,712
That trains and studies about how to break

2039
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,736
Through the type of

2040
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,528
Mental illness never

2041
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,808
It should be one that

2042
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:42,208
Is readily available to anybody with his mental illness that would allow

2043
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:45,792
Tell them to at the very least find some

2044
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,096
Part of life that they can function

2045
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,632
Happily

2046
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,400
Stupid

2047
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:53,728
Sounds stupid now you just need you just need somebody to be like

2048
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,264
You should do that

2049
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,592
And then they shove iodine

2050
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:05,248
Surprises burger burger

2051
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,528
So

2052
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:12,928
Brings in a Cavalcade of Infowars males

2053
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:18,048
Navigate to Zolman doesn't make any Headway these other two.

2054
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
Hey bro

2055
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Motivated

2056
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,824
Where is your motivation

2057
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,848
Adizus like

2058
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,968
Whatever just sort of like a lackadaisical response one guy comes in

2059
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,528
What have you done that you're proud of what's your

2060
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,064
Singer most proud of

2061
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,344
Other than your kid

2062
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:44,672
Eddie doesn't have anything

2063
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:50,304
Can come up with 15 minutes later he's like how I thought of an answer question what I'm most proud of

2064
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
Is my kid

2065
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:54,144
I said

2066
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,960
I don't want to play any clips of it cuz it

2067
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,984
Really sad

2068
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,032
Yeah it's watching this guy

2069
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,568
They're not

2070
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,176
I think they mean to humiliate him but it's humiliating for the people asking the questions

2071
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,200
And for Mike

2072
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:11,040
And I feel very bad about it

2073
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:15,648
Everything that you say to him if everything you say to a person is

2074
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,464
Why aren't you like me

2075
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,768
DIY f*** you b****

2076
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,816
Why are why are you different

2077
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,448
Disgraceful and I'm saying that about a guy who I think

2078
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,216
The danger

2079
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:35,360
That's a big part of big part of why is it dangerous because

2080
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
Never

2081
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:41,504
Got help but that's why this is a really difficult thing to talk about because we have

2082
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,600
On the one hand I think it's awful to Alex's behaving at all the other hand

2083
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
I find it very difficult to be

2084
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,952
We fully empathetic towards Michael Rotondo

2085
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
Cuz I think

2086
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:57,120
He's only only wear them because of something that is 100%

2087
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:00,960
Mental Health

2088
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:11,712
Funny parting shot they do that round-robin

2089
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:16,064
Hey you suck bro

2090
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,832
No

2091
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,136
There's a

2092
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
They have the

2093
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:25,024
They have this weird like video camera with just a microphone in front of it in a backdrop of

2094
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,584
That's what people come up in

2095
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:33,728
They come up like a spelling bee

2096
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
Some questions you like

2097
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,128
Pictures of my face

2098
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,664
So Alex

2099
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,968
Then you'll eat

2100
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,272
I think this begins with good advice

2101
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:49,088
Okay alright

2102
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,112
Goes off the rails

2103
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:53,952
Werewolf

2104
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,768
Box

2105
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,216
I think they're being athletic or at least like

2106
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:08,800
Getting some sort of regular exercise is it is a good thing for your mental health

2107
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:12,384
It did have there been studies that have been done that it's absolutely

2108
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,944
It's beneficial

2109
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,016
Restarts with kickboxing isn't a crazy idea because

2110
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,600
Martial arts are really good way to enforce discipline that's her thing

2111
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,136
As well as buildup comfort

2112
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:26,720
I think there's a lot of positive

2113
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
4 shirts

2114
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,280
I I like the

2115
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:30,304
Bicycle

2116
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,632
Flexi-Rod my bicycle

2117
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,912
Is it

2118
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
How would you like

2119
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,592
Tubi

2120
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,152
Bernie Sanders

2121
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
Probably wouldn't like that

2122
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:50,528
Someone else

2123
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:02,048
Maleficent

2124
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
I don't remember

2125
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,848
What's

2126
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,384
The fuc

2127
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:20,736

2129
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:29,952
That might be a little too personal hours

2130
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:36,096
So

2131
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:41,216
Ultimately I think Alex had no idea what the story was with this guy had no idea what

2132
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:46,592
Expect when he came into Studio

2133
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,640
I'm going to offer this guy a job

2134
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:57,344
I love your operate

2135
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,904
Surprising with 2000x

2136
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:03,744
$2 which is going to be enough for him to move into a place in New York

2137
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,512

2138
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:07,840
Subway near enough maybe Hoboken yeah

2139
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,144
Regular real reports

2140
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,752
Open up the New York Bureau with this guy who already has a lake

2141
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:20,896
Cuz he went viral

2142
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,968
He's a crazy

2143
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:26,272
Which would be started welfare

2144
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:29,856
Important Alex nested like not argue with him because he

2145
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:34,976
Don't know how to deal with this guy at that point

2146
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,376
Thrown on his back

2147
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:45,472
Foot by the like I think I might want to give you a job and then be like

2148
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:51,872
And then becomes dad joke

2149
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:58,272
Yep that's correct

2150
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,576
It's not very very awful

2151
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:04,928
And then reinforces all the mistakes

2152
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,744
I just I don't even I don't know

2153
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,560
I don't know what to say about what I was watching this I was like

2154
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,096

Supposedly benevolent attention of like I want to give this guy a job and give him to get out

2161
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:36,672
Really just to suck off a little bit of that side

2162
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,696
