00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
A couple dudes like sit around and drink novel

3
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
Montana's legendary soda in honor of

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,904
You know that ass whole body

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Montana's legendary soda

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,120
Its soda is better than the feelings that I have about Montana to point

7
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:41,728
Let's see

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
I'm part of the rest

9
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Estevan the ground

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
This is interesting

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
This is candy

12
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
This is gross

13
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
What is

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,088
What is groats

15
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
He's like

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,672
Have you ever put a lot of sugar after you

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Put the Kool-Aid mix

18
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,792
That is exactly what this there are similarities

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
But move on Alex Jones

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
This is a podcast about Alex Jones

21
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Is it

22
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
This is not just about Alex Jones

23
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
This is

24
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Awareness

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
But Alex Jones

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
And relative to that

27
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
I know

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
You know only

29
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
The slimmest margin

30
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
At this point as many episodes

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Done

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
As we've done

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,864
I know a whole lot more than I ever expected

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
This is a whole new level of

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,032
To get to today's episode but first I would like

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,128
To start things off with an out-of-context drop

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
From Alex

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
Because this is what they do

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,792
This is what they

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Don't laugh

41
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
That's some solid work

42
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,224
I get there's no way that he can ever start

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Don't laugh

44
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,600
It does not make me

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
I'd like to give a shout out to

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816

The show you can become a pilot

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Today we are going into part

51
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Of my

52
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Investigation to what the fuc

53
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Happened to Alex Jones

54
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
Brighton 2015

55
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
When when did it all go south

56
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
And why

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Yeah I think I'm going to try and read between the lines as best I can figure out exactly what happened

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,072
How about just tell us why and then we'll save everybody several hours

59
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
More fun

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Every Journey

61
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Call

62
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Investigation

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
We started the investigation

64
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
But

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Coincidentally

66
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
The day after Trump announces

67
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Some shooting happen

68
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
First investigation episode really became

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
About

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
The interview with Larry Nichols

71
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Which I believe is the kickoff in earnest

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
Of Alex's hero's journey

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
2016

74
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
This is going

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
To be a little bit more focused on the event

76
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Navigation

77
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:54,752
That one we had to deal with

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
We're going to

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
To be covering the

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
The time span

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Of June 9th

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
2015 up to July 5th

83
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Ms episode

84
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,552
Hosted a bunch of

85
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
Alex

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
For like 4 days of it until David night was hosting

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,047
And we're not going to talk about

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
And then I'm going to my cousin Buckley's weather

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
We don't talk about that cuz we don't want to bore

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,799
And then on top of that June 29th

91
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
We're not going to be covering that at all cuz I have nothing to do

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
With presidential election

93
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
Entire episode about it

94
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
You can find in RI

95
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
If you'd like

96
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Music off of

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Listener yawn asked us to go back

98
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Two when gay marriage got passed by this

99
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Court episode ended up being

100
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
June 29th

101
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
Yes so that's why I won't be covering that but

102
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Some variant

103
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
Interesting

104
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
To lay out for you and for our listeners

105
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
I'm excited to get to all of them we're going to begin here

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
Trump announced

107
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
Just kind of see on June 26th

108
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Yes at the same time

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
He made those horrible

110
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Disparaging comments about Mexico shipping us

111
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
A bunch of people

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
And they're not sending her back

113
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
What it means to be president

114
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,055
Absolutely

115
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
Before starting

116
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
On the 18th

117
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
Alex

118
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Think about Donald Trump

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
He said nothing at all about

120
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Not really

121
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,839
Hillary is evil

122
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Did that like

123
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
Give me an election or anything

124
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:05,567
Just throwing a little vampire

125
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Which

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,295
I'm beginning to love our regular

127
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
I will be

128
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
Completely cuz I've started to be really afraid of

129
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Butts

130
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Stevie Nicks

131
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
What's going on with it

132
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
I don't know man I just I don't want to f*** around

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,359
With a weird old southern

134
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
Is 70's on his Deathbed

135
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Deals

136
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Sanity

137
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
So much

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575
It isn't real

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,415
Yeah so we're going to start with

140
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
We're out

141
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Still

142
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Wrestling a little bit with the Charleston shooting at this point he's still giving a lot of like if you believe this stuff

143
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
You're an idiot

144
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
You know all these race issues

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Distract

146
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Are you still on the false flag

147
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Yeah

148
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Drop-in Reverend child being like

149
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,039
Yeah and so the

150
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,159
Only thing I wanted to pull from this episodes is not really anything worthwhile is

151
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
We're outside

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,559
On his desk I don't like that at all

153
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,911
On his anchor.

154
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,519
Hostile work environment.

155
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
It's one of those giant

156
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
Rifles

157
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,431
Like one of those big sniper rifles that they would

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
By one of his bonds

159
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
I called face down ass up

160
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Obvious thing to say but

161
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,671
Look at the logic of the people

162
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
At the end of the Civil War

163
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
That was racist the first gun laws were racist

164
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Is again

165
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
Upside down it's a total fraud

166
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
I'm not even going to get into the history

167
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Again

168
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
And the party the Ku Klux Klan

169
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
So

170
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
So at the end there

171
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,055
Civil rights himself said that we have lost

172
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
The South River

173
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
Never mention that because they are today

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
Wonderful it's a wonderful thing that everybody like

175
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,927
On the right for me on the right like always

176
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Civil War the Democrats

177
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Called

178
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
The GOP races

179
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Give me the Democrat

180
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Not a hunter

181
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
Because you accept

182
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Did those people who left the temp Kratts

183
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
Like with open arms just love you

184
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
Please

185
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,439
That's an illusion you have in your head does a paranoid fear narrative

186
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Or at least get our own guns

187
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Shoguns off Alex Jones's death

188
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
We've established

189
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Talked out the Pope

190
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Pope said that people who sell

191
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Weapons aren't Christian

192
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
And Joe Biggs

193
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Special Report

194
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,831
Head down rifles is owned by Christians

195
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
This idea that the NRA was founded to Armed black people against the KKK

196
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
I believe that 100% sense to me

197
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Please Dan go ahead and prove

198
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Alex Jones was absolutely

199
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,223
Nope is based on a comment that a guy named Harry Alford made

200
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
Oh are you saying that his

201
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
Tire argument is based on what

202
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,439
So Harry offered was the president of the national Black Chamber of Commerce

203
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Atlanta 2008

204
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,375
I want to thank the Lord for our constitution I also want to thank the NRA for its Legacy

205
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,191
The National Rifle Association was started founded

206
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
By religious leaders who wanted to protect freed slaves

207
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
From the Klu Klux Klan

208
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Pre-made

209
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
It is been

210
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
Wild

211
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
Disclaim all kinds of stuff

212
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
Doesn't prove his claim it all Alex Jones

213
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Speech by Ann Coulter

214
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Which will get you in a second

215
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,471
But fast

216
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
We love

217
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
Dismay

218
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Egyptian by their troops

219
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Union veterans

220
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Colonel William

221
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Speed Church

222
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
In General George Wingate

223
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
Formed the National Rifle Association 1871

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
The primary

225
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
To quote promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientist

226
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Cific bases

227
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
So basically they were concerned

228
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,823
That they were losing too many bullets

229
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Because they were going out to war if you will work good

230
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Yeah that doesn't sound

231
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
It doesn't

232
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,111
Basically them being like

233
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
We don't train people well enough

234
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
And the roots of the was largely educational

235
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Nearly as terrible as it is today

236
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Promoting

237
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Promoting guns

238
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Shortly after

239
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
To the Civil War

240
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Back then

241
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
I mean they were like

242
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
They might as well

243
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
Slingshots but that shoot farther you don't really have too much

244
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Control over where their bullets

245
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Yeah

246
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,559
The ball down in Monroe

247
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
Screw side barrels or whatever the hell they're called

248
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Adjust that like

249
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Hope for the best

250
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,663
So back to the NRA being sounded to

251
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Help

252
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Black people against the KKK

253
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
Ann Coulter speech

254
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
It was used

255
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
Alfred

256
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
You know

257
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Proof

258
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
And she made an argument about the organization called the blackguard

259
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Robert F Willie

260
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Who was the Civil Rights Act

261
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
And if you look actually at the

262
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
Activities

263
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Actually almost a bullseye

264
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,967
Williams after the NRA

265
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
We can state that when the NRA was created they were like

266
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Innate

267
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
We're going to need to be

268
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,791
Yeah really interesting and actually works against

269
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
The

270
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:32,703
Robert Williams took over leadership of the local chapter of the National Association

271
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Colored people

272
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,079
Close to the KKK

273
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,919
Williams filed for a charter with the NRA informed the blackguard

274
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
An armed group Committed to the protection of black

275
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
Mabel Williams

276
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
I said her husband the occupations of the members

277
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
When applying for the NRA Charter

278
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
That you quoted

279
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
I'm sure when we joined

280
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
And the years after then

281
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,071
Have they have known that we were a black group they would have revoked our Charter

282
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
She said of course

283
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
They basically just started it already chapter

284
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,103
Pretty solidly against the argument that the

285
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Like like most times whenever White

286
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
People have decided to help

287
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
Yeah never willingly do it on their own

288
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
History of

289
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Is Grimm

290
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
What are the big things that the Black Panthers

291
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Do is

292
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Watch

293
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
With a

294
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Get ton of guns

295
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
Whenever I cop arrested

296
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Like they would just go hang out like hey

297
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
If you didn't

298
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
That's fine

299
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,991
If you go beyond what it is you're supposed to go beyond

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Guess what there's 10

301
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
Doing like renewal project

302
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,999
Yeah they would have armed guards

303
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
They're putting up a stop sign

304
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Keep trying to put up

305
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Stop sign

306
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
I am so finally they just send out arms

307
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,663
What else do you do like that's the situation that

308
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,503
All too often everybody found themselves in over the years

309
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
In the Civil Rights

310
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
F*** it

311
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
All the time

312
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,463
All of the America

313
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
People have found themselves

314
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
And pushed

315
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
Sooner or later what other things can you think of other than

316
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
If you're going to threaten US with guns

317
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Which is a good why I'm in the place now I'm looking at all of our liberals

318
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
We should control guns and I'm more like

319
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,527
Gun control

320
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
They're starting to really talk to submit that there aren't armed liberals and liberals

321
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Pentagon

322
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
More vocal

323
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
About it

324
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
This is an in-depth investigation

325
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,407
Can I get into the in-depth investigation

326
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,223
The Sacramento Bee papers to jostle

327
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
The real

328
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Good enough

329
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,903
The rest of the episode on the 19th is just a bunch of like

330
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
Going back and forth on

331
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743

He is in the middle of Being Suit

335
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
Over the crystal

336
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
The only the governor's over the body

American flag

340
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,951
In his book he wrote that he beat up Jessica kurai

341
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Yeah

342
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Famous book

343
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
But he beat up Jesse

344
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Ventura in a bar fight

345
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
After Jesse mouth off about Murray

Didgeridoo

353
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Couldn't come to a bird

354
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
And ended up ruling in Jesse's favorite 822

355
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
After 5 days

356
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279

His estate

361
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Pile of garbage called American

362
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Don't recommend

363
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,663
Appeals

364
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
The Judgment the Ventura

365
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
+ 500000 of unjust enrichment

366
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
So it's 18 1.8 million dollars

367
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
The Judgment or is going to

368
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
The estate Appeals

369
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
And that's showing up on the show

370
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095

371
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935

Because I need to

375
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Tons of media organization

376
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Are promoting

377
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
This appeal

378
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
He's trying to appeal to Alex's audience on the basis of life

379
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Viacom

380
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855

ABC CBS New York time

382
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
They're all behind this

383
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Because they want to be able to lie about people and make money

384
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
That the estate

385
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Appeal

386
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
And Jessie and

387
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
What's a bummer

388
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
My relationship with Jesse Ventura

389
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,223
Like I kind of

390
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Had some good ideas

391
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
He's in the same boat is Alex but not a proper

392
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,207
Cuz he has a lot of really dumbass ideas but it's same time he's really

393
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
Philosophically consistent about his support of legalizing weed

394
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Maybe 10% more than Alex

395
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Not an a******

396
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
Well now that is on the Alex Jones Show

397
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,031
I'm of the opinion that

398
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,383
He is a libertarian

399
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Prominent Libertarians

400
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
I really

401
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
Yeah you're right you shouldn't go on his show

402
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
If you run for governor of Minnesota

403
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Novel

404
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,119
Are making this argument and I read the court decision of his appeals case

405
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Comes later

406
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Down the road

407
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
The appeal

408
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
Because he makes this exact same argument

409
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
I need Court as well

410
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
You guys should

411
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Vote for me

412
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,503
You guys should choose me

413
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Rule in my favor

414
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Because

415
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
They have an insurance policy

416
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
It's going to handle

417
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
Harpercollins has an insurance company

418
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Think that's going

419
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
To pay the saddle

420
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
You're not screwing over the family

421
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
I've been slandered

422
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Devoting my favorite

423
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
It turns out

424
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
That is very bad

425
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Was that true though

426
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Okay well that's a bad ARG

427
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
The appeals court found

428
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
They looked

429
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,176
Chris Kyle's contract with harpercollins

430
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
And the only thing they can find it

431
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Is one line in it that says

432
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
They may have him

433
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
They may have

434
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
Insurance

435
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Policy

436
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
He does exist

437
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
He brought it up

438
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
Open court and his lawyers made that argument

439
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Unfairly biases

440
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
The jury again

441
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Chris Kyle

442
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Oh yeah of course

443
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
Screw over a a widow

444
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
No but at the same time if I knew that

445
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
I was going to screw over a corporation

446
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,088
The Faceless millions of dollars

447
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Is

448
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
The traditional printed

449
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
We don't

450
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
We don't need to help

451
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:29,120
Twisting the Jesse's doing when he's on the show

452
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Who cares

453
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
I really don't need

454
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,960
To hear that application

455
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
But at the same time

456
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
Alex is starting to play a little game

457
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
Jeffy

458
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
You should run for president

459
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,968
She's trying to pitch Jesse Ventura you need to get in the race

460
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
I'm Jesse's argument is

461
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
I want to wait till there's just two

462
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
I want people in it I have name recognition

463
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
I think I remember him having that conversation

464
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
Eddie keeps saying I've got this appeal to take care of

465
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,840
Then I'll probably join the race

466
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
And if I lose

467
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
That's it

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
Maybe that's what happened

469
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
There's no show on Saturday

470
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
You take Saturdays off

471
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
So we come

472
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
On the 21st

473
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,248
So the 21st is a Sunday

474
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,832
I started to notice that what Alex Jones does on Sundays

475
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
Is

476
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
So he uses it to end and

477
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Start Naruto

478
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,608
And also to bury stories that he kind of Hope snowing really pay attention

479
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,728
Couple Sundays recently

480
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
To make the pizzagate apology

481
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
He's

482
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
Covered reporting on that

483
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,712
Another recent Sunday

484
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Violated the terms of their eye

485
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,088
Settlement agreement of course

486
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
Just whenever narrative has run out of steam

487
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,768
Never wants to launch a new one

488
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
He doesn't on Sunday

489
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
So on this Sunday

490
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
He knows that the Charleston narrative is kind of going away

491
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
So he uses Sunday to like

492
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
So he has an interview with jhacari

493
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Who's in Charles

494
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
And

495
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
It awesome

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Oh it's actually really awesome

497
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,296
I love Jacari jacks

498
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
I don't know as we all know now he is

499
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,280
World

500
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,352
So

501
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
No clue

502
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:43,520
He's talking about how beautiful the church service but he went to at the Emanuel African Methodist

503
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Episcopal Church

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,664
Was the night before he's talked about how there's a lot of unity and everybody in great

505
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Spirits

506
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
And it's a beautiful thing to witness

507
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
And it's super fun

508
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,880
That there's a monument to a white supremacist a block away from the church

509
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,976
I don't understand how

510
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
It's free speech

511
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,864
And you know I don't want to encroach on people but it's real world

512
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
He's talking about how that night

513
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
There's going to be a march across this historic Bridge

514
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,800
Everyone's going to be holding hands and it's going to be this beautiful thing

515
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
And Jacari is he had the right idea about

516
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
For the most part

517
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
Meanwhile Alex keep being like

518
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,088
I think so are we seeing the beginning of the end of

519
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Jakari Jackson

520
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:39,840
Alex wants to focus on the negative and rytary is really focus

521
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
Personally positive

522
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
And I think it's really cool is his literal come

523
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
The Jesus moment out of church

524
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:51,104
Possibly I don't know Whitney ends up quitting I don't know the story of that will find out more as if

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,384
This investigation goes

526
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
Sort of I believe

527
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Basically the end

528
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Charleston

529
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
He's got to be there

530
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:08,768
Courtship

531
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
It's time for the new narrative

532
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Which is

533
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
An incredibly intense

534
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,192
Prolong

535
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Argument that Financial collapse

536
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
Is coming this summer

537
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
Yeah it's right around the corner he has a bunch of people who are

538
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Experts

539
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
He has Peter Schiff

540
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
Who is Ron Paul's economic advisor

541
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
He has

542
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
A bunch of people on

543
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
And it's all about how the dollar is about to collapse

544
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
And how we're all going to be

545
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
We're going to get to that

546
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,520
You know where this is going

547
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,456
Spoiler on it

548
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:05,856
Willie was the Y2K thing again biscuits why would you push this

549
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,672
Narrative well I guess I'm also selling

550
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,256
Apocalypse supplies

551
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
Little course you're going to push this

552
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Narratives are what we already

553
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
Because you're a genius

554
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
You've already spoiled where that narrative it ends and why

555
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,080
Is probably worse than you

556
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
It's even more exploitative

557
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,688
What you're saying

558
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,296
In an hour and a half

559
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
Because

560
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
Jessica's boiler Alex Jones is out

561
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,184
To sell gold

562
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
You started this disaster

563
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Collapse narrative talks

564
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
The town about it

565
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,680
Anything's really focused around

566
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
He's talking about the main story is that he's pushing are about how

567
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Texas

568
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
From the reserves

569
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
I don't know

570
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,576
We don't trust

571
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
You guys holding our gold we want to hold it ourselves

572
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
That sort of

573
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,216
AutoZone like semiconductors

574
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,008
Electronics it does all kinds of

575
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Amazing

576
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:31,104
It does 0 amazing things sitting in a vault somewhere

577
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,872
Yeah but

578
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
Much like colloidal silver colloidal gold

579
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,968
I did not know that

580
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
What is colloidal

581
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Remember something to do with like

582
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
Floyd's

583
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
It has something to do with it being suspended in a solution

584
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
Anyway

585
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
It's all the gold narratives bad like

586
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,032
They're getting bars of tungsten covered in Gold like that

587
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
There is one

588
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,432
Like legitimate story of that but yeah

589
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
He's really pitching that

590
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Hard

591
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
But on this Sunday show

592
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
He says something that I

593
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
Blank is involved in his abortion narrative

594
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
But I'm not sure

595
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
But I could not do this show without playing this clip

596
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Cuz it's so weird

597
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,096
Listen to this argument

598
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Everett just

599
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,144
Recognize

600
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
How f****** dumb he is

601
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
While he's trying to talk about how smart

602
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,032
This is amazing

603
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
I want to listen to

604
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
The psychological warfare

605
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
The manipulation

606
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,112
Billboard

607
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,024
In downtown Austin

608
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
Understand that billboard you understand everything

609
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,800
Chick-fil-A

610
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,688
Chick-fil-A

611
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
As a window into guilt

612
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,584
Shut up little texas-based company

613
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
About Chick-fil-A

614
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
Set alarm for 9

615
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
See that's why

616
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,176
Little children

617
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
And I say ETS not this

618
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
And the cows

619
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
Look real but they also look humanoid

620
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,096
It's been downgraded

621
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Just a yellow.

622
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,264
The yellow blob with two eyes

623
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,712
On your guilt of not wanting to hurt an animal

624
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
Adult

625
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
Come on your smart

626
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
You know what it is

627
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
Alder

628
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,320
Show me more than

629
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
That

630
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
Crazy

631
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Isn't he

632
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
He's mad about it

633
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,048
Just thinks it's propaganda abortion somehow

634
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,888
Because you don't want animals go for the blob

635
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
Cuz the chicken

636
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,312
Nobody's not taking into account is the entire point of the app

637
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,920
Is the drawing the Billboards

638
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:23,296
The handwriting is really bad because

639
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
What do you think is going on there

640
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,704
Chick-fil-A

641
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,496
Chicken is really good

642
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,312
Actually read an article in

643
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
About the creation of this campaign.

644
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
The guy who started the campaign

645
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:59,392
Propaganda

646
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:05,792
Small advertising budget and they couldn't whenever they wanted to get outside of shopping malls

647
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
Just like a Sbarro or whatever

648
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
Directions in the mall

649
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
I've never had one

650
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Cuz malls are the devil

651
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
But they weren't they were in malls and I wanted to get

652
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Freestanding

653
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Start advertising with a couldn't

654
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
With anybody

655
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:24,992
They had no budget

656
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
So they did

657
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
Is it looks like we can't get commercials

658
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
Not really going to work out

659
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Billboards are

660
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Comparative

661
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
So they started doing

662
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
Billboard advertisements

663
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
They wanted to get

664
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
Pretty interesting ideas but they were all kind of like

665
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
So they came up with one

666
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Where it was

667
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,824
Three-quarters of the billboard is done

668
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
It's like a chicken sandwich

669
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
And it's like you know just a normal billboard

670
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
And then their last quarter of it

671
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Is white

672
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
Like designing

673
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Just had stopped

674
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
And it says boss

675
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
Got hungry be back later

676
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
On the the last part of the billboard

677
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
MMA have like a 3D

678
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
Going up to that

679
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,352
So people driving

680
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Okay this is

681
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,192
Interesting concept but we can do better

682
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
And around this time

683
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
Simpsons were super cute

684
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
And Bart's catchphrase was don't have it

685
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Call man

686
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,896
If we wanted to incorporate that somehow

687
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Add wizard

688
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
We're coming up with it

689
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Don't have a cow

690
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Alright

691
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
Chicken

692
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
Hopefully started a couple

693
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,720
An amazing reenact

694
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,120
Can see it in your eyes right now you're sitting in that ad room right here I'm waiting

695
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,216
For you to describe the small boy

696
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
Maybe they've got some paper on the wall just write down ideas

697
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,408
Terrible what they came up with cuz I am going to Farhan too long on the

698
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
Don't have a cow who doesn't want you to have cows

699
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:08,160
And don't want to be right

700
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
A carousel

701
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
It's amazing

702
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Family

703
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Selling

704
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,328
Right

705
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
It's not about abortion

706
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
It's about Portia

707
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
How do you not see that problem

708
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Find it right okay

709
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
You have cows

710
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
Because here's the truth of it

711
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,112
These cows are actually super intelligent

712
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
Good morning

713
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
Pretending to be these

714
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
It's not a real check

715
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Working yet do you know what else is eggs

716
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
How do you get

717
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,832
So as we all know now

718
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
Chick-fil-A invented

719
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:17,536
Exact look all this b*******

720
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
You get this

721
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,704
You get everything

722
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,408
What was the beginning thing like it's a window into

723
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
Amanda looks like real

724
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:47,232
Isn't really feel guilty about the idea

725
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
I think that's necessarily A

726
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
I do

727
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Well I know I mean from

728
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,472
As far as a worldview of

729
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
Ifyou humanized

730
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
You're much more likely to

731
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
You care about it

732
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
That you don't care

733
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,736
Right like the chickens were also anthropomorphize 2 on the billboard

734
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
And they were both like

735
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,856
Computing and drawing like Lego

736
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Situation where it's

737
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
You know what

738
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,864
You're not on the same level here that's what makes people like me and Allie

739
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Different from you

740
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
Well it's been fun is going out tonight

741
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,264
We're done

742
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
Ice cream

743
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,152
Abruptly as because I go

744
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
Full Alex

745
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,576
I believe that's the wrong quick but it's just like rocket I'm in

746
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,160
What was going on on the

747
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
20

748
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Second

749
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,560
A lot of the rest of the stuff again is just laying out of the 21st

750
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,144
Beginning of the narrative about

751
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Collapse

752
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
So we go into the 22nd that's Monday

753
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
Is virtual collapse of the financial

754
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
System

755
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
I got to get

756
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
This thing off my

757
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
Yeah that's all

758
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Time to get in

759
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Yep

760
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Damn you out

761
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,928
Nipsey 22nd comes around at the Monday

762
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,768
You still on his b******* about the collapse

763
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
Peter Schiff

764
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
Who explains that

765
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
There's a bubble

766
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,032
Just Breathe

767
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,056
Sister now you can say that

768
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
Kind of

769
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
The didn't

770
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
The dollar still hold value

771
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:51,136
So they're really right

772
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,440
Misunderstood that the reason the collapse

773
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
Who's coming with because

774
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,192
Episode

775
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Is stuff about how

776
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,408
Racism

777
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,200
Paul Joseph Watson

778
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,504
This is where he does his horrible parody character

779
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,832
Mangina

780
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,392
Paul Joseph Watson makes the argument

781
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,464
Clinton's running on feminist lies

782
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
All this s***

783
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,144
And all that stuff is kind of kind of stuff we touch down in past episodes

784
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Earlier I did say

785
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Truck

786
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
He is from Britain

787
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
I hope it gets

788
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
Hit by a lorry

789
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,224
Now we can move on or any of our listeners

790
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,856
Does we make Corrections amarok

791
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:59,232
Episode

792
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,328
He's really mad that people want to take down

793
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Confederate flag

794
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
Or is he called it the Battle Flag

795
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,240
If you're calling it The battleflag you're just

796
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,288
Define why we wanted to be taken down

797
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,664
So he put an article that he brings up and

798
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley

799
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
Who is now the Ambassador

800
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,856
I was one of the people

801
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
To say these were

802
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,928
Very weird

803
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
The Confederate flag out of the State Building

804
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
And so we end the show

805
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
With

806
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Would she think

807
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Is

808
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
On the reality of War

809
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,184
From Texas

810
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
Oh dammit

811
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
It was about who

812
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,376
Enjoy Western

813
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,336
On Southern

814
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
Southern president

815
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,560
SuperShuttle South had slaves

816
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,592
They were slaves transferred got here to pay for the layover

817
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
To explain Civil War

818
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,975
On their way over here and who were treated the worst

819
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
As well

820
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,495
Man the hammer drill rap

821
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,639
That's the point in the US Military

822
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,711
He didn't support slavery

823
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:34,111
Bulshit

824
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,351
Dress up in Gray uniforms at home

825
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
I don't dress up in blue uniforms at home

826
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,519
Quite frankly

827
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Southern Civil War

828
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,831
Wait what

829
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,879
Pretty f*****-up

830
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:11,231
What are you supposed to been right there rednecks in the know the lo-down to me

831
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
I don't like that

832
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,631
I don't believe that's true

833
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
What would you be in the know about

834
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
That would cause YouTube

835
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
To Alex Jones

836
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
But no idea

837
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Look

838
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
The plight of the app

839
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:37,087
Bright

840
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Now admit it

841
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
I don't want to talk about

842
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
But

843
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
We killed em

844
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
Why don't why don't you don't dress up Grace

845
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,847
So a couple fun facts resolution of

846
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Profession

847
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,151
From various States

848
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:04,479
If you go read the documents with their secession convention

849
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,063
Slavery or white

850
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,135
Supremacy in Mississippi

851
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Slave or slavery

852
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
Attempt

853
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:19,071
Throughout the document never once mentioned the word tax or Terror

854
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
South Carolina's mention

855
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Enslave 18 time

856
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
What's the fare

857
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
It's talking about

858
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:36,479
This argument little looking into this has nothing to do with

859
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Actually it's it's pretty interesting history how everyone has

860
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
Two sides of issues

861
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,303
Interesting article by guy named Mark William Palin

862
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,351
Is a professor of history at the University of

863
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
It was breaking down visterra Fargo

864
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,591
Was explaining is the argument about parrot leading to the Civil War

865
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,175
Is based on a misunderstanding about the situation that existed

866
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,735
During the 1832 nullification

867
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
In crisis

868
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
That's

869
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
Got

870
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
Misunderstanding

871
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,719
With the 1860 1861

872
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
Secession of Southern States

873
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,327
That's basically what people 20 years off

874
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
They can fight those two things

875
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,519
So in 1860 the moral Tariff was passed

876
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
But

877
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
This is very interest

878
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,943
Precisely because southern states began seceding from December 1860 onwards

879
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,247
A number of Southern Senators had resigned

880
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,551
The could otherwise have voted against the terrorists

881
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,879
Have not resigned they would have had enough votes in the Senate

882
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
Congressional Passage

883
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
Because they

884
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,511
They didn't have a boat anymore

885
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
So this came before this moral tariff

886
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Now what's interesting

887
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Is the Confederacy wanted the British people

888
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Recognized

889
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
Confederacy as a Sovereign Nation

890
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Yes so what they did

891
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
Is they started to make the argument

892
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Bit because of

893
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,735
The almost immediate

894
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
They what made the argument to the British

895
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
When that could not have possibly been the case

896
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
The closeness and time they created a ton of

897
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,583
Confusion

898
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,911
A group of people who hit seceded from the country over slavery

899
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,471
Considering the fact that they already abolish slavery

900
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
10:15

901
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Beforehand

902
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,079
And so they basically

903
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,639
Pretended that

904
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Sure sure

905
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,479
Pro Southern business interests

906
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,807
Internal it's not slavery

907
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,647
The better to win over people who might be appalled

908
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
The forces of abolition

909
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,975
On March 12th 1861

910
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Just 10 days after the Morrill tariff

911
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Become law

912
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,863
Editorial voice to the terrorist why

913
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
The newspaper pronounce that quote

914
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,703
Protection was quite as much a Cause

915
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,495
The disruption of the Union is slavery

916
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
And remarked upon how the moral tariff had quote much

917
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,871
Change the tone of public feeling in favor of this

918
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,319
Plies work

919
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,903
Milgard involved and started writing essays about houses

920
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
What they're saying

921
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
And had been

922
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
It's all about slavery

923
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Hey

924
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Who care

925
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,631
Who cares if it's

926
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
Who cares if it's 60/40

927
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
Slavery

928
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:48,735
Recite because of slavery there still f****** place

929
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
Being beholden

930
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,343
And being beholden to this narrative

931
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,927
Really indicates either he hasn't researched it as much as he think

932
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,255
Or he's been researching really dicey sources

933
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
He's inclined to just

934
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
The

935
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
Slavery apologist arkema

936
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Commenting

937
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
Like I remember being in school

938
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,407
Small dump

939
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,967
Town with people pulling that Narrative of like

940
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,527
It was slavery but also say

941
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
Like they were telling that lie like they were his like that

942
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Was

943
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
That was the same thing

944
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Traverse City

945
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
Like teaching other surgery

946
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
Creative

947
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,887
Intelligent design or whatever dumb lies there

948
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:43,007
Some believe that

949
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
And we're not going

950
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,639
You can invent your own truth

951
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,759
Well

952
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,831
Starting to self on the show Independence

953
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
People

954
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Confederate

955
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,719
Melts

956
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,815
Boggles my mind

957
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
Still don't

958
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Put together like

959
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
He specifically

960
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
We pointed it out

961
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,215
Only 2% had

962
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,239
Slaves

963
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
Do you see what a big

964
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Half

965
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,431
All of the wealth concentrated within a very small number of people

966
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:28,831
Can create the top 1%

967
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,135
Leedstone in humans eating

968
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,255
Free market

969
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:42,655
Flea market in everyone's up in that exact situation that were in

970
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,959
I mean if you want to look at

971
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,519
Stream is a free market there were people who sold themselves into

972
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
The slavery for black

973
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
Ain't back in Greece

974
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
Cuz that's one of things I studied about

975
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
Austin College

976
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
One of the big

977
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
Problems that led to almost

978
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Premature collapse of Greece

979
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,063
Was the people sold themselves into slavery

980
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,391
They don't because they were so destitute

981
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
Sell themselves

982
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,231
And it got to a point where

983
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
That the government

984
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
Having to be like

985
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
Nah

986
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Buck

987
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,375
There

988
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,655
You guys are all free

989
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
And that's what the North had to do

990
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
I mean we did actually

991
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Save the United States

992
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
By getting rid of slavery

993
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,871
Alex's

994
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
An idiot

995
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Through things

996
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
That are like

997
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Glosses over

998
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
There's one at the end where he's like

999
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
A black person

1000
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
How did the cotton gin

1001
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Who cares

1002
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
I mean that's a good

1003
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:45,119
That's probably true

1004
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
I understand that the South

1005
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,959
Sneaker

1006
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
The South was bamboozled

1007
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
The South was shut up

1008
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,383
They were flipped the north was a victim received well

1009
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
Did the South fight

1010
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:07,647
3141

1011
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,791
Did the South win the first 23 years against the North

1012
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,471
They absolutely dominated

1013
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:33,247
The children of

1014
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,063
Trautwein

1015
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
That fart

1016
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,167
On the side of the child I wonder why

1017
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
The history you're given

1018
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,383
Is not the real history that was going on slavery was a horrible Institution

1019
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,735
Counties in Alabama

1020
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
What was that

1021
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
What

1022
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
WhatsApp

1023
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
But the weather

1024
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,375
The North

1025
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
The park

1026
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,847
Start to abolish slavery

1027
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
We're so proud of her

1028
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,479
What is fighting

1029
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Sure

1030
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
I guess

1031
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
Be like if the

1032
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
Spartans were the bad guy

1033
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
The person but that's what 300

1034
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
Well yeah but do you not remember the Spartans

1035
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,503
War they fought against Athens that wound up destroying all I remember

1036
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,135
And what if they kill their babies I'm not talk about abortion I'm saying weird had big leave them on a mountain

1037
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Good luck

1038
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:23,839
Is that not what abortion is it's not quite remember protesting against an abortion doctor

1039
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Here one day and it

1040
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:31,007
Is right next to a mountain

1041
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,407
Shut up basically their own

1042
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,479
Creole

1043
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Agrarian combine

1044
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
That was going on a lot of people

1045
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,231
George Washington Thomas Jefferson

1046
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:02,751
2%

1047
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,847
Ireland

1048
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,151
Then what the media projection

1049
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,807
Is not what's going on

1050
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
No reflection

1051
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
In reality

1052
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
Then the biggest issue

1053
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:28,607
Is that for the Civil War

1054
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,007
Followers Sherman's model of reconstruction

1055
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
By John Wilkes Booth

1056
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,855
Northern Industrial

1057
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:55,231
Ocean temperatures on record

1058
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
And then when I had the boa constrictor

1059
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,191
East Coast

1060
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,519
222 basically cut off supplies

1061
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,847
The British Supply

1062
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
Watch shows like roots

1063
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,599
They show a guy with a web beat the black guy

1064
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,207
Slavery was already been phased out

1065
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,791
It was

1066
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:32,095
Whitney's cotton gin

1067
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,455
Oh that was. Yeah there we go

1068
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
No I'm sorry I only made slavery

1069
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,879
Improve things at all

1070
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,303
I need streamline the blow like cotton was dying as an industry slavery perhaps

1071
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,679
Dude that was falling out of favor

1072
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,055
Even more important is for slaves

1073
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,663
It's so stupid

1074
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,455
Kills me

1075
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
When they're talking about

1076
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
This is day

1077
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
We all know who they is

1078
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,439
Alex about slavery end

1079
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
And like the

1080
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
Horrible mistreat

1081
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Of slaves

1082
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
The fact that you own

1083
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
It's always like

1084
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
Yes it was a bad

1085
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
Like always

1086
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:46,079
Xbox designs like why are you

1087
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:54,015
Fury that it should be like the idea that owning slaves

1088
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Is just

1089
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Situation

1090
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:03,743
Here's what it comes down to for me hold one opinion

1091
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
So he can't

1092
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Really agree

1093
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Embody

1094
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
Slavery was wrong

1095
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,983
Sharecroppers had it bad to at the same time

1096
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
He if he says

1097
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,567
It's slavery with really bad

1098
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,151
That in some ways invalidates the argument that sharecroppers had it bad

1099
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,967
Mortgage did making

1100
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,991
Because it offends

1101
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
White people

1102
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,343
Torque makes white victimhood narrative which we know

1103
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,463
That was a super long I apologize

1104
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,023
But I wanted to demonstrate first of all

1105
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,351
That this is the kind of stuff he's wasting his time

1106
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,215
Importantly we want

1107
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
John Wilkes Booth was a false

1108
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:53,663
Everything is offline

1109
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,943
Everything

1110
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,087
Trump has been running for president now for

1111
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
What would it be

1112
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
6 days

1113
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
An eternity

1114
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
And making a comment

1115
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
About the Mexican

1116
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
You still not mention him at all

1117
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Still not mention Trump

1118
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,959
Barely mentioned the election

1119
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,799
I'll wash it out of her mouth with a nice out-of-context drop

1120
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
I'm so moral

1121
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,615
It's disgusting

1122
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,455
Alright Alex Gonzaga call baby

1123
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
I love that

1124
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
So bizarre

1125
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
What is

1126
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
What if

1127
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
What are you

1128
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,399
Talking about very weird

1129
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,215
I don't even remember what contacts

1130
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
What could

1131
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
There's nothing more to say

1132
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
He's so moral it is

1133
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Disgusting

1134
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,223
Remove on illustrating perhaps

1135
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,527
The great paradox

1136
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,063
True morality

1137
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,135
Once you reach a certain point

1138
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Evil USB

1139
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
Is

1140
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
Tuesday we're on a Tuesday show now

1141
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
On that day is that they were talking about

1142
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
TPP

1143
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,543
Talk about giving Obama

1144
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
The fast-track authority

1145
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Partnership

1146
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,687
Evil nefarious thing

1147
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
People don't ever take into account when

1148
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
Bremen

1149
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
What is that

1150
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
Literally every president

1151
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
Since Gerald Ford

1152
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
With the exception of Bill Klein

1153
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,767
Has been granted Fast Track

1154
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
Yeah

1155
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
Basically

1156
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:53,215
Is there a notary normal Obama

1157
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Not share with them

1158
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
Well I mean Bill Clinton didn't get it

1159
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Song

1160
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
Obama

1161
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:07,807
What leads up to

1162
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,855
But to get this fast track

1163
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,671
Sounds like something that's weird

1164
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Disgusting

1165
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
Supernormal

1166
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
If something happens with every president

1167
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
I think one of the big reasons

1168
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
Didn't get it

1169
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,631
Was because of the Larry Nichols types

1170
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,911
And all the propaganda

1171
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,703
Any quotes

1172
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Conspiracy

1173
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,007
That unfortunately is real

1174
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
The Hillary complains about

1175
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
It is very much

1176
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,919
Citra seems like it will be making an appearance

1177
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,223
On this episode here on the 23rd

1178
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,527
Arvest Tuesday show

1179
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Because Alex Jones

1180
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
Still bent out of shape about the TPP

1181
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,415
He plays a couple of really long video

1182
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
At one of them

1183
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,255
Is Senator

1184
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
On the

1185
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,607
Giving a speech about how the

1186
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
The partnership takes away the song

1187
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Of the country and the Congress

1188
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
And this

1189
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
Is the first instance

1190
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
Of Alex

1191
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Being super complementary

1192
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Trump's cabinet

1193
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Part of Trumps campaign

1194
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,831
Still not talked about Trump at all

1195
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,927
So here Alex I said

1196
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
I'll allow the

1197
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,583
The powers of the United States

1198
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
I don't want interrupt

1199
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,263
Kimora

1200
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,359
This is one of the main leaders

1201
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
But

1202
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,095
Starting to get a sense of Alex's political Hedgehog

1203
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
Rand Paul is

1204
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,727
Someone he always talks about Ron Paul comes on

1205
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,007
Is Showbox

1206
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Partnership

1207
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Most likely

1208
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
That's a big part

1209
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Is so

1210
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,063
Because Alex Pacific partnership

1211
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
As the final step

1212
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
2 globalist

1213
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Enslavement

1214
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:29,631
Our country eventually will the Asian Union and European Union

1215
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:34,751
Trans-pacific partnership they're all going to be merged together

1216
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,567
All right so that's basically where he's at

1217
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Barcodes

1218
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,687
Total episodes

1219
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
Months

1220
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
Let's just put it this way

1221
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,159
He probably believe the Civil War was about Tara

1222
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
You almost certainly believe that

1223
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Either that

1224
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,279
Never learned that

1225
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
Keebler Elf

1226
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,095
Yeah

1227
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,143
That's a large part of this episode

1228
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
He wants to talk about that

1229
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
About it other than his

1230
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Beers

1231
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,567
Narrative

1232
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,615
He does explain that because of

1233
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
And all these unions merge

1234
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,271
The UN is going to take over Israel but Muslims will still be killing Christians all over the place

1235
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
Transitions

1236
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,671
Smoothly into him selling his gallbladder cleanse

1237
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Product

1238
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,487
I wish it was a damn good

1239
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,399
Splinter gallbladder I don't understand how

1240
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
What

1241
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
A gallbladder

1242
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
Would be cleansed out

1243
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,127
There's a plastic you end up taking in because of

1244
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
Shut the globalist to put in your food

1245
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,247
I may all collect in the gallbladder

1246
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
So you take a bunch of his medicine

1247
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,319
Is a supplement

1248
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,671
And then you drink like rice wine vinegar or something like that apple cider vinegar

1249
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,767
And then on the sixth day of the clamps you drink like a glass

1250
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,327
Of olive oil

1251
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
For a couple hours

1252
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Emma

1253
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:13,311
He's not specific but I think he said you just s*** forever

1254
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:19,711
It's got a clip of what one of the grossest things ever find the product

1255
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:23,039
What other result of all of that

1256
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:29,439
Could you tell me what apple cider vinegar for 6 days and a big old glass full of olive oil

1257
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,095
Careers for 6 weeks

1258
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
Now you pass a bunch

1259
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Plastic

1260
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
Through your butt

1261
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
Which is

1262
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
No

1263
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
The PowerPoint this episode we get a return visit for my old friend

1264
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
Find Larry Nichols

1265
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,039
Yes

1266
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
On the last episode that he was on

1267
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,367
He came on

1268
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
And I believe

1269
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
Kicked off Alex's lamp

1270
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
Which was laying dormant

1271
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
Idiot

1272
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
His career

1273
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,887
Is respected by Alex

1274
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,543
Alex what you need to do. You're the only one who can save us

1275
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
He articulated it I think

1276
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Is the route

1277
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
About

1278
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Journey

1279
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,479
So he comes back on in this episode

1280
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,807
He's mostly just talking about a lot of murders

1281
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
The clintons have committed

1282
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Talks about some guy who

1283
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,183
I'll cut off his hands on his legs

1284
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,743
Decapitated himself

1285
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
I found no evidence

1286
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
But this is a real thing that happened

1287
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,327
But

1288
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,143
What he really wants to talk about is

1289
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,935
We need to build an army

1290
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
He's enlisting Alex

1291
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
His followers

1292
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Just stop

1293
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
That's exactly what we need

1294
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,199
I love it when people say let's turn into an arm

1295
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
That has no negative connotation

1296
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Listen to it whatsoever

1297
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
Describe

1298
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:05,695
I'm here to give you a character

1299
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,607
It's up to your audience

1300
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,959
Play for me and Theo

1301
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:23,615
He says there's 25

1302
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,687
So you got to know who they are if you're going to stop them

1303
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:35,135
Murders in also plays the last episode

1304
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,023
So he talks about Hillary Clinton went to which church with the lady from Lee Vining women

1305
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
I meant he drops this one on

1306
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:49,215
Remember the time to show you what kind of woman this was

1307
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:56,383
Two Secret Service agents in the White House

1308
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
Gallery in bed

1309
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,695
Court Bond

1310
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,679
People

1311
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
We call the clintons

1312
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:28,127
Hillary f**** for Markie Post yes you played at the public defender

1313
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:33,247
No Hillary if I had known this

1314
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:36,831
Hillary

1315
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:43,231
Markie Post

1316
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,071
So you pulled up a chair and Hillary didn't like that he was watching

1317
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,119
So he started throwing lights

1318
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
That

1319
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
The problem is

1320
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Pretty true

1321
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
Also sounds like in terms of like

1322
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,015
Like this is after House of Cards was 2015

1323
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:14,207
Larry Nichols obsession with people from sitcoms super cool

1324
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
Also like

1325
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,119
He's going to do is come back every week

1326
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,655
And have a standalone

1327
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Wreck-It Ralph

1328
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Except this

1329
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
Designing Women which church

1330
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:29,567
Is the scandals that you starting with x

Dude you got to do better cuz I don't care if

I'm pissed off you didn't invite me check Taylor

1333
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,599
I don't care if she had sex with Markie Post she's a beautiful woman

1334
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,367
And

1335
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:47,743
I don't care pilkinton watched and I don't care if she threw an ashtray well here's the one thing that you don't know yet

1336
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Write the Scandal app

1337
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
Hillary Clinton

1338
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Both

1339
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
Telling bad jokes

1340
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
Long panel wiring

1341
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,223
Also she f*****

1342
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
When she's like Telly Savalas

1343
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
Put a lollipop

1344
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Alright

1345
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
Buckethead

1346
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
That's what Larry Nichols wants

1347
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,639
I think the most important piece of it do

1348
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,663
Cummins

1349
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,223

Contribution

1352
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
I think the most important part is that he's trying to enlist Alex's audience manipulative

1353
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,423
Because he knows the millions of people listening

1354
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,191
He's like

1355
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
Just trying to

1356
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,519
Get his agenda through and you nosey

1357
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,103
The other stuff is just really funny

1358
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,151
Really funny

2 Wednesday the 24th

1361
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
If this

1362
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,575
Is where I belong

1363
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:17,855
Everything

1364
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
The 24th

1365
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
4th ID 2015

1366
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
I have reason to believe

1367
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,327
That this is where Alex

1368
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Began to lose his

1369
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Now

1370
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,679
Have you ever read the case of

1371
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,959
Charles Dexter Ward

1372
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
HP Lovecraft

1373
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
So

1374
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
Part of it is

1375
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,079
Does a running

1376
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,615
Trend throughout it of

1377
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:43,199
There's a guy named Charles Dexter Ward who at some point absolutely lost

1378
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,759
Does mine different psychiatrist

1379
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
They have like

1380
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,319
Thought it was

1381
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
AutoZone

1382
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
He was later

1383
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,951
I'm all of those psychiatrist it comes to Alex

1384
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:57,023
Cuz I swear I think he lost his mind

1385
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
This one is big

1386
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,447
I'll just play the putting a lot more chips on this one

1387
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Well

1388
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,799
There's two things that happened on this episode that I think are

1389
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,103
Here's the first one

1390
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:15,199
I just want you to take this

1391
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
The future

1392
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,791
You can say scientifically

1393
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
Basically

1394
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,687
Oh my God

1395
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
And whether it was a dream or real

1396
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,807
Weather app

1397
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
It doesn't matter because

1398
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
Without a shadow of a doubt

1399
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,119
Whether it was at 9

1400
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Incredible

1401
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,031
20

1402
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,127
Movie

1403
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
Smell-o-vision

1404
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,783
How much would you pay for

1405
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,975
From the brink of Destruction

1406
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
So

1407
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
Alex Jones

1408
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
How to dream

1409
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,863
Messiah

1410
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,399
He had a prophetic dream

1411
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
That's what he's

1412
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
Sour cream

1413
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,055
No no no

1414
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
But

1415
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,247
This legitimate

1416
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Is

1417
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
Crazy

1418
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,927
In my life

1419
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
Just lucid dreaming for a little while

1420
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,279
GameStop Mastery over the Dreamscape

1421
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,935
What have you

1422
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,239
When you apply

1423
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,543
Concrete meaning to dream

1424
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
A lot of the time you're really messing

1425
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
You're doing something really bad

1426
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:22,431
And I can think of no pasta

1427
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
Historical

1428
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,551
0 times where a man has said

1429
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
Listen

1430
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,391
The future

1431
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,671
Do what I say

1432
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,791
Yeah that's usually very verifiable thing

1433
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,095
Really get to Indy

1434
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,911
About the dream itself

1435
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,239
Except to say that it was the next 20 years what the globalists are going

1436
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,639
Follow the exact

1437
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
Almost as if

1438
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,967
He is a crazy person

1439
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,247
Who is fixated

1440
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:59,551
On this bizarre

1441
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,879
False reality

1442
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,463
That it has invaded

1443
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,679
You know his nightmares obviously this thing that he thinks about all the time

1444
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
So

1445
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
That's not all

1446
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,007
Like mine are just about

1447
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
Slowly burning

1448
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,479
Just money

1449
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Mariana

1450
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,063
6 hours

1451
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
6 hour

1452
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,695
I was set Ablaze

1453
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,767
Was it Hillary Clinton

1454
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,351
There's only one

1455
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:51,007
Naruto

1456
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
Has not done

1457
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,311
Talk about this

1458
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,967
Everybody loves it when you help me

1459
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:04,063
Absolutely horrible

1460
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,999
Through their eyes

1461
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Adorable

1462
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
Horrible

1463
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,959
The future is going to be just hell on Earth people

1464
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,519
Emma churches won't warn anybody

1465
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:41,183
I have this dream that everything's going to be living here

1466
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:50,655
Please give me money

1467
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,615
Meanwhile making fun of the Prosperity Gospel

1468
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,687
And the Prosperity Gospel people are f******

1469
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,159
So I think that's perfect

1470
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,183
To mock them

1471
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,487
Like hey hey hey

1472
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Look at these idiots over here don't give them your

1473
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,679
I thought you're going to make the argument that the asking for money with parody

1474
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Oh no

1475
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,007
He would have to understand

1476
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
That's true

1477
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:32,127
To Alex's

1478
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,199
I'm going to talk about the dream and then do a pitch for money

1479
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,367
That he started to internalized the Savior myth

1480
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:44,927
That Larry Nichols has brought to the show

1481
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,743
Because that already

1482
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,327
It exacerbates already had under the surface

1483
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,911
But you probably wasn't able to really come out with them because

1484
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,959
Even he knows that would be grandiose

1485
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,239
How people be like

1486
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,567
Nichols has brought it to him

1487
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,615
It gives him much in the same way

1488
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:06,687
Reverend Childress Racing the Charleston was fake

1489
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
To say it's fake

1490
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
Larry Nichols

1491
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,551
Being like you are safe here

1492
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,159
I believe

1493
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
Are you making the ark

1494
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
You meant that this

1495
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,999
Is when his delusion

1496
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
Out

1497
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Or are you making the argument

1498
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
When he gives in

1499
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,959
I think more the ladder

1500
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
I think

1501
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,311
The moments

1502
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,615
At least where his mind

1503
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
Becomes like

1504
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,431
There is something

1505
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Talkin to me

1506
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
Like these dreams

1507
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,135
He described it as a vision of the next

1508
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
20 years

1509
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,719
And he's the only one

1510
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,023
With your mother

1511
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Right

1512
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,839
And you're going to need

1513
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,143
If there's one thing I know about apakah

1514
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,447
Uniden

1515
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
10 more reporters

1516
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
Exactly

1517
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:09,407
The first thing that's super important

1518
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,991
The other thing is the introduction of a new character in

1519
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
The pantheon

1520
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Of Infowars

1521
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Not rainbows

1522
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,951
She's just

1523
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:27,583
All the characters who played big roles now aren't around

1524
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,631
The Rodger Stone

1525
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,239
He's not on any of these episodes

1526
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,543
Almost every episode

1527
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,871
Right

1528
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
Necessarily usually just doing three hours

1529
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
If you have to get

1530
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,551
Some topics stuff like that

1531
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:51,135
So a lot

1532
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,415
Star cast of rotating

1533
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
Rip David

1534
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,791
Lee Ann McAdoo Jakari Jackson

1535
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,583
Surround

1536
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,655
Right

1537
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
So far I've seen

1538
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,727
No evidence of Rappaport existing back then

1539
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
Although I'll keep you posted

1540
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,103
I'm sure you still alive

1541
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,759
Flipped into existence in 2016

1542
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
He pulled him from

1543
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,671
The first instance

1544
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
That I can

1545
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
Confine

1546
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,279
But I may be wrong

1547
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,095
But I know that it's the first time she has ever been on

1548
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,167
And I believe it's the first time he's had a guest from Rebel me

1549
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Oh okay

1550
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:40,031
Mike cernovich and rebel media at this point

1551
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:46,431
Very low-key don't know what he's doing at this point probably

1552
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:50,783
He's not he's not on his radar

1553
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:57,183
Jack pasovic isn't a player at this point he's not even on the anyone's radar

1554
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Isn't

1555
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:04,095
If he's involved but he's not on Alex's radar

1556
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
He hasn't popped up on

1557
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Any shows

1558
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
But

1559
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
Alex does on the 24th

1560
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
Lejeune have someone from Rebel media

1561
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
On

1562
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
As a guest

1563
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
Alright

1564
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
At this point she was a college

1565
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,224
If you have a YouTube channel

1566
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
And reports

1567
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,808
Episode

1568
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
She had just put out a video

1569
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,160
That was making fun of the Walk

1570
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:36,352
I'm assuming that she's doing it in a very sex-positive way and saying that there is no reason for women to be

1571
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,888
Ashamed after they have

1572
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:43,264
Wonderful night with somebody that they care about you

1573
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,568
You might have the wrong angle on this

1574
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,408
She's making fun of them for having sex in

1575
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
Well if she turns it all ice

1576
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,504
She turns it into a rape thing

1577
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
And to be fair some of it was

1578
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Summerville

1579
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,392
The protest was about

1580
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,464
Oh absolutely

1581
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,280
That is prevalent across many

1582
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Like a baler bulshit

1583
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:15,008
I'm on board the Starship sex positivity to it and

1584
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,568
So she goes out and it's all

1585
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,872
I'm going to play 2 clip

1586
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
From

1587
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:23,456
When they play her report

1588
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,480
They play a bit of

1589
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:27,296
And I want to make you really mad

1590
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,600
I need to hear Alex

1591
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
I doubt it'll

1592
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,184
I need you

1593
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,232
Going to be right in my wheelhouse

1594
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
I'm going to agree with her

1595
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,328
I need you and the audience

1596
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,352
To hear Alex

1597
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Mumbling in the background

1598
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,424
While the video player

1599
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
Because

1600
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
It

1601
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,032
Real it's worse than the report itself

1602
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
You're the first one

1603
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
This is

1604
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Voice will come in for a second

1605
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,248
And then a lady on the street

1606
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,784
We'll start to Sotto

1607
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,344
Confront her about her position

1608
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,672
I would describe this as Lauren not being good

1609
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Not thinking fast

1610
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:13,120
Is it stopping rapes

1611
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:45,120
When Dory

1612
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,920
Police

1613
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,712
Percent

1614
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,672
Ask for help they seek medical attention

1615
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,000
She thinks

1616
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,560
Like the reporting to a women's clinic

1617
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,912
Call recording

1618
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,776
She's really moving goalposts around and then when Lauren is asked

1619
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,568
She stammers through a couple numbers

1620
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
Alex

1621
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
Right now listening to this going

1622
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,064
Lauren isn't doing the job

1623
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
She's a woman

1624
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:46,560
Listening to women talk to each other and he's not like that at all nothing and I was going

1625
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,680
To each other that what

1626
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,008
Yeah even if

1627
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,104
Also you get the same

1628
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,712
Even though he thinks that she's not doing the right job or doing it hard enough

1629
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Alright

1630
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,064
I like what she's putting down

1631
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
She's on the right

1632
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,368
Side of it

1633
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,392
Anti-feminist

1634
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
The woman

1635
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,952
Yeah that's why that's

1636
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
Right there

1637
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
Text pretty handle

1638
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,008
Keep posting these Mark Dice videos where it doesn't show what

1639
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,288
He thinks it shows

1640
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,080
She posted on the rebel inside

1641
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,176
Like know if you listen to what they're actually saying

1642
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,016
No cheese

1643
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,576
And you're like

1644
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,160
Think about it is that she comes away from

1645
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
Making that that was a win for

1646
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Like

1647
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,352
The woman she's talking to very clearly goes away with that

1648
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,144
Thinking I'm never going to get through

1649
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,264
Somehow the people who know what's going on

1650
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
Reflect reality

1651
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
Who can see the issues

1652
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,920
Losing

1653
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,712
Whenever they're arguing with Liars

1654
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
With people are just

1655
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Elderly and

1656
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
Completely willing to

1657
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
To obfuscate

1658
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Misunderstand

1659
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,368
And then

1660
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,160
Lie about the results

1661
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,696
The world now

1662
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:24,096
There's a really funny clip that I didn't cut out because it gets murky

1663
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,656
By Alex

1664
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:33,056
But there's one point in her to not use someone else

1665
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,080
Haha

1666
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,896
This person doesn't want you to use their footage can you take it out

1667
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
She doesn't consent

1668
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Do you using footage

1669
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,440
I bet you're not respecting her consent

1670
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,352
Dislike

1671
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
Like it's a sketch

1672
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
So

1673
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,216
So bizarre

1674
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,008
But I so the next one

1675
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,824
Is Lauren starts

1676
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
At the March

1677
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
A Judaism

1678
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,760
A dude is talking

1679
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,320
Is he is he

1680
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Dudeism

1681
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,664
Coming on the show

1682
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:45,504
Alex's

1683
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
It's just a total b*******

1684
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:49,856
Yeah

1685
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
We don't break it

1686
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,648
Golaurens

1687
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
Lawrence

1688
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:56,768
Rebel media bonafide

1689
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,792
Canada

1690
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,864
How did she get hooked up with Rebel media

1691
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,936
I believe they found her

1692
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Goodwill jobs

1693
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:11,616
I understand

1694
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:21,088
I would have just cut this out and been like this isn't really relevant to The Narrative of

1695
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,112
The Trump

1696
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,648
Investigation that I'm on

1697
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,184
But I believe it's relevant

1698
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Because this

1699
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,720
I think

1700
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,536
Is the point where Rebel media becomes

1701
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,096
A factor in the Infowars verse

1702
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,632
In the world of Alex Jones

1703
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,912
He starts getting

1704
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,704
Bespoke

1705
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,728
Which leads

1706
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
Him to bring in Gavin McGinnis of The Proud boys

1707
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,688
Picture because of them

1708
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Are all of these

1709
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Disparate parts

1710
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
They're coming together

1711
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:57,696
Yeah I believe so and as best I can tell this is sort of the route of the year on June 24th

1712
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,976
The day of Alex's vision

1713
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
So that's

1714
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Really f*****

1715
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
After this Alex leaves

1716
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,632
The studio and ghost

1717
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
The Buckley is winning

1718
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:10,752
So he's gone from the 25th to the 28th

1719
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:15,104
He is so I've no idea what happened

1720
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
I don't care

1721
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:20,224
On the 29th comes back and

1722
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,064
Listen to that episode

1723
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:29,184
There's one thing that we didn't talk about on that episode as much as I would have liked

1724
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:32,512
Interview with a guy and they talk

1725
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:38,144
The globalists are to blame for the destabilization of Ukraine

1726
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Sanctions

1727
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:47,104
So much like

1728
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,408
Went out started kissing his ass

1729
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:54,272
The Russian sanctions part wasn't part of Trumps at that point

1730
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Yeah Alex

1731
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
Cuz clearly already

1732
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Yeah

1733
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
So

1734
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,256
Alex Jones

1735
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,560
Russia Annex

1736
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
Crimea

1737
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,216
Came before Trump

1738
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,544
I don't think that he thinks that Russia is totally innocent

1739
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,408
He thinks that it's the globalist fault and Russia's just trying to help out the people of Ukraine

1740
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:26,528
And beyond that the UN forces

1741
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:30,624
At the door

1742
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,928
Is what he's more concerned about

1743
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
Like without

1744
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
Hearing it

1745
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
I I just see him being like

1746
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,936
But now that it's

1747
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:47,264
Like if if he's seeing that as a

1748
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
An opera

1749
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Opportunity for the

1750
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,616
The UN to grab more power

1751
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,896
Then now I can

1752
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,176
See why he would take

1753
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:54,944
Take that

1754
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
More organically

1755
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,832
Yeah it does the worldview of little bit

1756
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,624
Because of the involvement of the UN

1757
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,928
Because his imagined influence

1758
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:05,696
The globalist

1759
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
Yeah but at the same time it is

1760
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
Pro-russia

1761
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Yeah which is very

1762
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,656
I don't know

1763
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:20,800
I don't have a whole lot of context but I hope to discover it as we move forward to the investigation

1764
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,616
So now we get to June 30th

1765
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,408
Studio

1766
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
This episode

1767
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
Is

1768
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:28,736
A disaster

1769
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,528
Alex

1770
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
You know he's been on his vacation

1771
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:36,160
He's still getting back into the groove

1772
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,696
He does about a

1773
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
40 minutes

1774
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:43,072
With his cousin Buckley's wife

1775
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,400
This is probably before he got remarried

1776
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:52,032
When they first started yeah this is when the divorce

1777
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,176
He doesn't 40-minute ads for brain Force

1778
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,736
Yet with gucciardi

1779
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,808
Who is a writer for Infowars and apparently some

1780
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,832
Naturopathic

1781
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Of sorts

1782
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
I don't know

1783
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,232
I don't know

1784
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:13,024
I don't know

1785
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,560
Congealing from

1786
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
Penicillin

1787
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
Somebody's Baby

1788
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,192
I don't think Anthony gucciardi still around

1789
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,520
Episode

1790
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,568
No. Not with the fold

1791
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,592
And

1792
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,616
He is

1793
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,152
Incredibly silent

1794
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:29,920
For a large

1795
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,968
Part of the time he's on screen

1796
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:35,552
Much like your car has regular

1797
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,856
He knows with them

1798
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,976
The fuk up

1799
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,280
So long

1800
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,560
It's

1801
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,584
The Sunday show

1802
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
40 minutes

1803
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,912
I believe that's a Sunday

1804
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:58,848
Fiore

1805
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,176
Commercial

1806
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,480
Tell this story

1807
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,064
I believe he's trying to build

1808
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,600
Credibility about himself

1809
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
But I don't believe it

1810
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,520
Eva

1811
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:32,128
Not really but also

1812
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,176
He does not get to these new

1813
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
Dangerous

1814
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
Terrifying

1815
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:44,672
I can't believe he has rights to play Beatles

1816
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
No

1817
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,816
The ghost of Michael Jackson would never allow this

1818
01:32:54,400 --> 01:33:00,544
Exaggerating

1819
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:09,760
Just overwhelmed then break your will show your level hasn't broken my will

1820
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,576
But I just already know all this is coming

1821
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,904
Opposed

1822
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,376
And that's why they tell you what they're going to do

1823
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:33,056
It's because humans are designed to adapt evolve overcome

1824
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:42,016
Slavery

1825
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,600
Do I say that all the time because it's very high-level globalist

1826
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
Sickeningly

1827
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,280
On a 3-hour flight to New York first class

1828
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,560
What happened the other two hours

1829
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
To it

1830
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,200
Conversation that must

1831
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:20,160
I am

1832
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,208
His suit look perfect

1833
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,304
I wouldn't even know how to look like that

1834
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,376
And that he could just arrogantly laugh at me when I walked off the plane

1835
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:41,664
Oh yeah you really talk to this person

1836
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,736
There's a whole nother world out there

1837
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:48,064
When you're a journalist

1838
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,928
People know you live not breaking confidences

1839
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
So you live in

1840
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,000
Play

1841
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:59,840
Do you live in Thai

1842
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:12,640
So again our theory about Everytime You Lie to get some of the details all the details

1843
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:19,808
That opens up

1844
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,856
I'm not giving up confidential sources

1845
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,928
The him giving away

1846
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:30,560
Prescott system operation

1847
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:40,544
But he literally says the people open up to you would rather

1848
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
You having somebody

1849
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,592
Seriously listen to what

1850
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
Is about to say

1851
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:46,176
That the

1852
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,736
And I'll go

1853
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,552
You're going to fail

1854
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:53,600
It's like my head

1855
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
15 years ago

1856
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:57,696
Going from memory

1857
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:19,712
Almost

1858
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:40,960
Cuz I got a heartbreak

1859
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:45,568
The guy said this is off the Record right

1860
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:49,920
The he's just telling people that literally a demonstration of

1861
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456
Him not being

1862
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:56,064
Clearly made of that was obviously

1863
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,088
Here's what

1864
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,696
The guy found out he wasn't from The New York Times he found out he was from Infowars instead

1865
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
Cuz I'm

1866
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
Uwell

1867
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,400
We better get steroids

1868
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
Hallmark

1869
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,264
So they come back from break

1870
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,336
Talks to the board operator

1871
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
He's like

1872
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:30,880
Hey you were here. Happened

1873
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:34,208
You heard him say that just like you said

1874
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,256
Cabela's also says

1875
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,608
Look at the end there he said that you said this is off the Record

1876
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
To make it like

1877
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,944
Was that the name that's Alicia

1878
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:58,784
The show goes on a little while

1879
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:03,392
Interview with a lady

1880
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,184
Actually let's talk

1881
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,048
The whole bunch fairly reasonable and gives a lot of reasons

1882
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,840
40

1883
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,728
Alex doesn't talk at all and she's crazy

1884
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,640
This is right before

1885
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
The maximum amount of time they can

1886
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
Can handle reasonability

1887
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:34,368
I think Alex is getting his brain fourth notes in order while she was talking

1888
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,184
Entire product plug for

1889
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,280
And Anthony gucciardi is sitting there silently

1890
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,096
Through this entire clip I'm about to play for you

1891
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
That is

1892
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
Bonkers

1893
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,680
But I want to be clear

1894
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,960
Alex thinks

1895
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,984
Play into Anthony

And Anthony's just going

01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,664
Making no noise is just nodding his head like

01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,016
Like that cuz they've only got one camera

1900
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552

Promo about becoming reality

1911
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:07,040

10 million dollars

1914
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,816
The Second Amendment

1915
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,608
He wasn't paid.

1916
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Closest money

1917
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:35,968
Rolling out on TV

1918
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,056
Basically his whole Fortune

1919
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:02,336
Second Amendment

1920
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,360
I feel like

1921
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:10,016
Clint Eastwood in Charlton Heston are very similar

1922
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,832
David gold tells are great

1923
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:21,536
Spoiler alert

1924
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:26,400
It was Earth the whole time he traveled through time

1925
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,408
Everybody

1926
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,688
Is racist

1927
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Margaret Sanger

1928
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
And stuff like that

1929
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
Because the

1930
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:52,512
Yes so here is something from the NRA's website about Trump

1931
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,816
There's a little bit of a biography

1932
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Control

1933
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,520
68

1934
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,568
Appearing on the ABCs

1935
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
The bishop

1936
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
This bill is no mystery

1937
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,456
Let's be clear about it

1938
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:13,248
Its purpose is simple and direct

1939
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,808
It's not to deprive the Sportsman of his hunting gun

1940
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,344
The Marksman of a Target gun

1941
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,464
Irresponsible his constitutional right to own a firearm

1942
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,512
It is to prevent the murder of Americans

1943
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,864
Hesston opposed the Vietnam War and considered running for the US Senate as a Democrat

1944
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,936
Affiliation

1945
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:34,240
With his endorsement of a Republican

1946
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Ronald Reagan for

1947
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:41,920
Delivering a fiery speech at the free Congress Foundation

1948
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,480
Society persecuted

1949
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,064
A year later he was elected the president of the NRA

1950
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,440
So it looks like maybe he lost his mind around 1990s

1951
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,512
That's not an uncommon

1952
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
Trajectory

1953
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,560
Like that

1954
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,584
That's what happened

1955
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
When do that

1956
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:03,680
Entire generation like Fox News loving

1957
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,240
Progenitors

1958
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,008
Wind-up

1959
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Having that very

1960
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,616
20 years ago my dad was

1961
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:13,152
And a vicious

1962
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
Obama's

1963
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,808
Birth certificate

1964
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:21,856
Until

1965
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,904
Rodger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch

1966
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:28,000
Droid the world Google

1967
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,024
It will literally

01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,912
He doesn't care about Caitlyn Jenner

1970
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:41,312
I don't care about the argument

1971
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,480
It's about how

1972
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:51,296
Some cop beat up a guy

1973
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:00,000
That's. Right

1974
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:00,768
That's it

1975
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:05,632
He said that position with him supporting Arpaio and sporting Sheriff Clarke

1976
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,936
It's like I agree with

1977
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
The point but you're not logically consistent

1978
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,776
Your question

1979
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,104

We call them racist

1985
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
With proof that's where

1986
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,608

There might be I don't care

1995
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,624
I could

1996
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,416
They actually are a

1997

Whatever he's gone because

2001
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,680
People like Owen Shroyer

2002
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:14,496
Millie Weaver is not around

2003
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:24,736
From everything I've listened to so far so

2004
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,784
There's not all that much of a mystery

2005
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:30,368
So mysteriously absent gives

2006
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,976

Do dick too hard

2010
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,216
So on this

2011
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:49,312
July 2nd episode most of the narrative that he's pushing is about

2012
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,336
How I

2013
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872

Juneau Airport

2015
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:57,504
Basically are requiring people

2016
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,040
I have a federal ID

2017
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,832
Travel exist

2018
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Is the market

2019
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
Oh well

2020
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,232
Totally on board

2021
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:10,048
No

2022
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:14,912
Because he he believes

2023
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,192
It's the federal ID

2024
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:22,336
Do federal ID or still like an Illinois driver's license

2025
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,360
Like a federal piece

2026
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
States that

2027
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,504
With the federal government

2028
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
The mark of the beast

2029
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:37,440
Mo ID laws for voting

2030
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:42,048
So complicated

2031
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:42,816
Look up

2032
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,608
So in the first

2033
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,936
What blind spots do

2034
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,496
Pretty man like I'd like that

2035
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,520
Like that

2036
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:56,384
Like he has an ideology

2037
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,432
Completely and utterly

2038
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:05,856
Choosing what he's beholding to like do you like one thing that I think about alot

2039
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,864
I'll just because

2040
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:18,912
Is all natural

2041
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,104
Like

2042
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,920
I listen to that and I think

2043
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,456
I am not

2044
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
Some sort of

2045
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,504
Superhuman

2046
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:36,320
I hope that I have my own blind spot

2047
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,344
Like that

2048
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,880
What what are they

2049
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,952
Like I'm trying to find someplace where I would not apply

2050
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,000
Play My Philosophy

2051
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:48,096
Those questions meme that

2052
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:51,168
You'll figure it out

2053
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
I'm incorrect

2054
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:53,472
Yeah I think

2055
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,240
You and I

2056
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,520
Sea life especially

2057
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Philosophies and

2058
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
Political beliefs

2059
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,408
A sort of works

2060
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
In progress

2061
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,456
Start

2062
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,016
In that circumstance

2063
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,600
There are unalienable principles

2064
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,904
Human dignity human rights

2065
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
To constantly be

2066
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
Shifting

2067
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,328
Economic realities shifting political realities

2068
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:23,680
Like you would be nearly as radical as you feel right now

2069
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,968
Does motivate

2070
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Absolutely

2071
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,528
It also

2072
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:42,368
Those inconsistencies are those blind spots are best seen by other

2073
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,464
Ratchet is often very difficult on yourself

2074
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:51,328
But like in therapy or with your friends

2075
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,096
Are the places

2076
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,120
You can best

2077
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
Define hosting

2078
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
A whole lot of people who will

2079
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,032
Dude what about that

2080
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,312
Yeah even his lawyers bad

2081
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,152
You're full of s*** what are you doing

2082
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
I don't know

2083
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,992
I don't know

2084
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,784
Bore the problem being

2085
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,856
Cynthia is on those in a liter

2086
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,160
Yeah like that that

2087
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,208
You and I

2088
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,000
It is bad

2089
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:20,768
Anybody

2090
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,048
Gets beat up by the cops

2091
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:26,400
And we're always against

2092
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,728
Is only against it

2093
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,008
Whenever it is

2094
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,544
Let's face it

2095
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,456
Like like with our pay on all that's

2096
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
How do you not apply that

2097
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
Same

2098
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,832
Rich badwan cups

2099
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:55,072
He what he believes to be police not investigating sexual assault

2100
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,096
It's done by

2101
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,168
Immigrants who have come here

2102
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,704
He's super mad about that

2103
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,240
But never really stops

2104
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,592
Joe Arpaio personally oversaw Department

2105
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,128
That just ignored

2106
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,408
Sexual assault complaint

2107
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
And rape complaint

2108
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,480
Because people were immigrants

2109
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,296
Let's not get back into no but you understand that

2110
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,320
F****** Kate

2111
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:22,464
Consistency yeah I don't know I know I know there are blind spots that we have

2112
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't know if they are you guys

2113
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:29,120
You guys can find any I'm open to hearing

2114
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:31,168
We get to July 2nd

2115
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,728
And this is a revolutionary moment

2116
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,264
Cuz I'm July 2nd

2117
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
What would that be

2118
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,080
16 days

2119
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:41,408
Donald Trump president

2120
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,944
Alex Jones

2121
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
Finally

2122
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:46,016
Save Donald Trump's name on his show

2123
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:48,576
Is the first

2124
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,624
I'll let you see what's

2125
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,904
What where you at

2126
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,728
Running

2127
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,056
Against

2128
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:17,760
Trump and

2129
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,088
Is the front-runner by giving them

2130
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,136
Magnify

2131
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,448
And then he will

2132
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:40,288
And then we'll

2133
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,896
Only in America

2134
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,200
Fake political

2135
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:57,952
Very reasonable announces that everybody was making at that time basically right more or less

2136
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:04,352
So two things

2137
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,888
If there was

2138
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:11,520
Maybe that's the real world works very differently than Alex is fake

2139
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,544
F****** narrative

2140
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,896
Thought that that was what's going to happen

2141
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,432
That's the first time he's meant

2142
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,552
Whatever

2143
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:28,672
He also makes this claim with Ron Paul

2144
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,488
And he's bringing up Rand Paul

2145
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:34,304
Is also running for president

2146
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,912
It must be all your hard work

2147
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,216
The only person out of a field of light

2148
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:42,752
Eleven candidates

2149
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,056
Call radical

2150
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:50,176
Just because 50 years ago he be called middle-of-the-road he just promoting basics

2151
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:55,808
I hope and pray.

2152
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,600
He'll help educate people

2153
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:04,512
The only person who standing up for Americana ideas

2154
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,816
He is very much on the ramp

2155
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,840
Super into it

2156
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:12,448
So he has Ron Paul

2157
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,240
Tiffany is there like

2158
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,032
Is there like one moment where you

2159
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Switches tracks

2160
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:23,456
This isn't this investigation is ongoing my friend

2161
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:32,160
He gets into a little bit of a sales pitch

2162
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:34,720
I'm just going to play it

2163
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:39,072
I'm a very superstitious person

2164
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Superbad

2165
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,640
I just love that like

2166
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:55,456
Like I don't

2167
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:04,160
Until the beginning of the show and we've talked about a bit along the way

2168
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:09,024
The big narratives that he's been pushing along with all these sort of mini ones that we've been discussing

2169
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:15,680
Yeah this stupid all these interviews with supposed

2170
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,960
Experts like

2171
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,264
Paul Craig Roberts

2172
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:21,568
That was more about the Putin

2173
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,848
But Peter shift

2174
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:23,872
Max Keiser

2175
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,152
He had these people on

2176
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,432
I got on his own

2177
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,224
And is just making the argument

2178
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,296
That f****** the economy is about to collapse

2179
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,600
Yeah everything and he does

2180
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:35,392
Specifically the summer

2181
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,440
He's talking about maybe the fall

2182
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,720
Summer maybe the

2183
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:44,608
We're already into July

2184
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:47,680
So he's basically everything is coming down

2185
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,472
He's also talking about gold

2186
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:52,032
July 2nd

2187
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,336
He has a little Gaston Studio

2188
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,456
And

2189
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:06,112
There will be an infomercial at the end

2190
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,000
Modest resources

2191
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:16,096
Sponsor for the show 19

2192
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,800
This time slot

2193
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:27,360
Well 17 years

2194
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:36,576
Emerald

2195
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:41,184
Financial meltdown

2196
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
So

2197
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:50,144
The globalists are headed towards the exit

2198
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,704
Stronghold

2199
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,008
Search

2200
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:00,640
Anderson owns the Genesis communication Network

2201
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,432
Vindicates Alex Jones Show

2202
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:06,016
On all these mystery Affiliates that are apparently leaving

2203
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:06,784
So

2204
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,856
He is basically responsible for most of Alex Jones

2205
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,904
He also owned

2206
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:16,512
Oil company

2207
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:19,072
I like the way

2208
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,376
It started 17 years ago

2209
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:24,960
As a reputable Gold and Silver Company

2210
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:29,824
No longer reputable if you look online

2211
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,592
Midas

2212
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:33,152
I don't know enough to say I don't know

2213
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,968
Along the way

2214
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,736
Through the pass

2215
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
Couple weeks

2216
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,552
He has been saying a bunch

2217
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:43,136
Just talk about how cold is going to be selling for $50,000 an ounce

2218
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,464
Yeah he's been talkin about gold a lot

2219
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:50,304
In the context of all this financial collapse stuff you see

2220
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,608
A Ted he brings up at Ron Paul

2221
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,168
Just was on the show

2222
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:58,240
Right Alex make money if they sell gold

2223
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,520
The mighty

2224
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,824
It's a wonder One

2225
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:04,128
You can't do this

2226
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,664
He's fear-mongering

2227
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:10,016
Greenlawn

2228
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,368
And don't go am saying we're going to play an infomercial

2229
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:18,976
What's the most unethical thing ever

2230
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:24,864
Basically he just talks about how gold is

2231
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,400
Skyrocket

2232
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,984
This is Alex

2233
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,008
Stomach nausea

2234
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:31,776
What time

2235
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,312
Set

2236
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,952
Respectful

2237
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,512
When it starts racing up I believe it will

2238
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:56,864
And

2239
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,704
If they can continue to suppress it I'll be surprised but regardless

2240
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:04,544
So his argument is that the globalists are suppressing gold prices

2241
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,384
Because they want to buy it all up and then

2242
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,688
Paintball

2243
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,712
You're an idiot

2244
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:17,088
Yeah

2245
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,416
Gold prices

2246
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,184
Grown-up really

2247
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,744
Substantially at all

2248
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:26,816
It's right around there like $1,213 an ounce

2249
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,680
Which still bananas for whatever

2250
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,984
Quite a while and not really gone up or down

2251
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,056
That could really make any money

2252
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:39,616
With the amount than Alex Jones listen to cook by

2253
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:40,896
Right

2254
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:43,968
It's f****** stupid at all it does is sell Ted Anderson School

2255
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,528
This is one of the most unethical things

2256
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:47,296
I've ever seen

2257
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,344
Because legitimately

2258
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,880
Weeks leading up to this

2259
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,416
He's spelling out this

2260
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,720
Shift

2261
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:58,816
The content of his show is leading up to this interview at 10 a.m.

2262
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,864
He knows this interview is coming

2263
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,912
That's The Prestige

2264
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,448
The revelation

2265
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,240
All of the other stuff is

2266
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,592
And get them into a state of mind

2267
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:14,176
Weather like

2268
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,200
What

2269
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,224
Talkin about

2270

Yes

2273
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:29,024
This entire thing was just one buildup

2274
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,560
The Narrative I believe so

2275
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,328
And then

2276
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,352
At the end

2277
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632

Deliver the solution to

2281
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:47,456
Shifted off the Charleston narrative

2282
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:53,856
Which is an out of character for him mr. collapses still within his

2283
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
He shipped

2284
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,672
Immediately

2285
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,976
With predictions of the summer

2286
01:59:59,232 --> 01:59:59,744
Consistent

2287
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:04,096
And it's so focused around goal

2288
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
Yeah

2289
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,632
That it

2290
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,680
No way

2291
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,240
Do you think he got a direct

2292
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:12,800
Yeah

2293
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,128
So in his bosses saying like I stole some more gold

2294
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:16,896
Probably

2295
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:23,296
For sure

2296
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,064
Conspiratorial

2297
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:28,160
Information that is is

2298
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:31,232

02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:39,168
Yeah they go to their advertising guys and say put together

2301

02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,360
Alex Jones is the cows on a billboard for gold

2305
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,408
What is 4 - 3

2306
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,528
Which is what makes them different

2307
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:57,856
Qualify

02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,928
You're in ethical broadcaster

2309

Your parent company owns

2311
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,280

02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:20,640
Whenever you're talkin about these collapse narrative

2317
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,176
Conflict event

2318
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:24,480
Person wants to come on

2319
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:29,088
You have to tell him you can't use my platform

2328
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:46,752

Same s*** that people do on in

2333
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,456
Instagram like their models and

Just have products

2335
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
In the background they make

2336
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,808
Like it

2337
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:01,600

So f***** up

2339
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:08,256
Prophetic dream was one of the ocean

2340
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:09,024
For me

2341
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,072
Terms of this investigation

2342
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:12,864
Write this was another

2343
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,912
It turns out that that prophetic

2344
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:16,448
Dream was a

2345
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
Email

2346
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:23,104
Latite was about three lines long 6 hours to read in that email was

2347
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:29,248
Goddamnit we need to sell some of your f****** off easy

2348
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,296
Before bed

2349
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:33,088
So

2350
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:36,928
Warriors

2351
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,840
Episode Alex Jones

2352
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,888
Has another interview with Jesse Ventura

2353
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:50,496
Brent comes back on in lies exactly the same way

2354
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
Total

2355
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,824
And this time

2356
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,104
They take it a step

2357
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:55,872
Further

2358
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,200
In this in this time when he's on

2359
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,760
Jesse's

2360
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,112
Appeal of the cases

2361
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,392
He thinks

2362
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,720
Is it Hillary nose

2363
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,048
Right

2364
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,584
Jeb Bush is a wenis

2365
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:21,984
That's his angle

2366
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,264
Great but he probably

2367
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,032
Couldn't win

2368
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,616
You still whole hog in the rampart

2369
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,640
Yeah

2370
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:29,664
He's crying

2371
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,432
Hard

2372
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:31,456
To get Jesse to run

2373
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,760
So he's not

2374
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,040
Like I'd like I said

2375
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:39,904
16

2376
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,696
Yeah but he's not on

2377
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:42,976
At all

2378
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,512
16 m

2379
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:46,048
16 days after

2380
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:49,120
The Mexicans are rapists

2381
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,144
Not on

2382
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:53,216
It wasn't until the ground by the

2383
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,008
That

2384
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,800
Alex was like finally

2385
02:03:57,312 --> 02:04:01,152
Someone I can relate

2386
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,688
No I don't know

2387
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,736
Treats women as objects

2388
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:08,064
Guarantee

2389
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,856
He talked a lot of s*** about Billy bush

2390
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:13,440
I'm sure he can't wait to get to that

2391
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:16,256
Yeah I think one that's already

2392
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,024

2396
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:28,288
And we're not going to play it cuz I'm sick of playing Mark Dice Clips on the Shelf

2397
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:35,200
On the previous day on the second video where he was going around asking people if they knew

2398
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:35,968
On the 4th of July

2402
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512

2403
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,792
Correcting myself

2407
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,032
Well goes great

2408
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:04,128
Man on the street is so bad

2409
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:07,200
It's not funny and it doesn't make a point

2410
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
They do that

2411
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
I'm playing this clip

2412
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,856
Cuz it's the reverse of it sort of

2413
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,136
This clip

2414
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:18,464

2415
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,744

The Clippers hilarious

2422
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,192

2423
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:31,520
Before Ma

2424
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,568
Abortion clinic

2425
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,640
Spontaneously

2426
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:43,040
Crowded women in circle depression cement

2427
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:06,080
Eurasian people always show up going I love Satan I want to kill people I want to kill black people

Mckellips and Oliver UPS

2430
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,808
We lost to this

2431
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:54,208
4th of July

2432
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,744
Declaration of Independence

2433
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,024
Who's against satanists

2434
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:01,120
Here's the first

2435
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,400
Here's the thing

2436
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,448
On a different episode

2437
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:10,848
Remember which one it was

2438
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,872
Play the video of it

2439
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:24,928
Oh really people where's that but not the same way

2440
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:28,000
The same way that we talk about this

2441
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:32,352
People wanting to put up satanic things at State Building

2442
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:38,752
You have your religion here we're just going to talk with you

2443
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,664
Deer laugh

2444
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,016
Reality

2445
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,552
He hears them is like

2446
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:52,832
Obviously they mean

2447
02:07:53,344 --> 02:07:55,136
Obviously they are real satanists

2448
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,416
But that's

2449
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:59,488
That does that does make

2450
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,352
His world

2451
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,888
Then so many other things

2452
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,424
Then become

2453
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,192
Wolf Lake

2454
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:10,240
Every time

2455
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,776
Because of how stupid

2456
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:17,152
Globalist on the plane

2457
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:21,248
Someone making conversation with him and then laughing at it

2458
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,784
Also I will take

2459
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:28,928
Insider information from colors and random people that he meets become parts of his narrative

2460
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,952
Took

2461
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:32,768
No ability to know what is real and what is not

2462
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,048
And this clip

2463
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:35,328
Completely demonstrates

2464
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,192
And the way he integrate these people trolling him at an abortion rally he is

2465
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,240
They're part of the

2466
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
Satanic

2467
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:48,640
Thing that worships abortion that's what Liberals are and that's fully informed

2468
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,432
About liberals

2469
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,736
It's crazy

2470
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:54,784
How

2471
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:55,808
How

2472
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,112
What is it

2473
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:58,880
She is

2474
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:05,280
On that does iodine

2475
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:08,608
Don't take his supplements

2476
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,240
Pretty much not at all

2477
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:17,312
Unbelief is a very important

2478
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,592
Piece of my investigation

2479
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,872
I think it does

2480
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,432
Appreciate

2481
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:23,968
Of what ends up

2482
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,248
Getting him down the Trump

2483
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,552
But I think there's

2484
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:29,344
More to the story

2485
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,976
Whenever it may be

2486
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:40,864
Lexus plugin

2487
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,680
And cut it open

2488
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:48,800
Because on the last show he opened the floodgates talking about Donald Trump

2489
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:49,824
Now

2490
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,104
Alex

2491
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
Has a couple things he wants

2492
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,408
To say about Donald

2493
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,456
The first one

2494
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:03,648
That's what is

2495
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:04,928
But

2496
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,952
He doesn't just

2497
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Thank you

2498
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,792
Does he have a high-level source that is

2499
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,584
Confirm in this next clip

2500
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:14,912
He implies knowledge of something about Donald Trump

2501
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
This clip

2502
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,472
Made me

2503
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
Gas

2504
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:22,336
At work when I was listening I was researching this episode

2505
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:23,360
I guess

2506
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,920
And then I had to walk around the room

2507
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,712
And go outside and smoke a cigarette

2508
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,784
I was freaked out when I heard this next

2509
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,600
Like you saw three Muslim woman in the pool show

2510
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:38,208
University

2511
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:43,328
Palisades houses 4013

2512
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:48,704
Is this Donald Trump

2513
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:54,848
For some

2514
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:01,760
And

2515
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,832
They go in there

2516
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:08,160
This is mind-blowing I don't know what to say anymore

2517
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,184
Wow

2518
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:11,232
So you know what he saying

2519
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,512
That's mob

2520
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,816
Consortium is on the East Coast

2521
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:16,096
Does Bob

2522
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:20,192
All this stuff that people are now

2523
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:22,496
You know coming out in real research

2524
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:24,544
Is that

2525
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,568
Donald Trump

2526
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,104
Alex knew about

2527
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:27,872
That stuff

2528
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:28,896
In 2015

2529
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:32,224
Before he ever got on board

2530
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:34,784
When he thought he was just there for publicity

2531
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,320
Alex Jones

2532
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:37,600
He knows something

2533
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:42,208
I don't know exactly what he knows but the way he phrased that

2534
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:49,632
So the problem with that is it does have the same ring of a lot of the lies that he told about

2535
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:54,240
He thinks Donald the globalist

2536
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
Perfectly within his

2537
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:59,104
Worldview to be like

2538
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,152
What just the same way

2539
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,712
Jason Momoa

2540
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:04,992
Demons

2541
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,272
Either whatever

2542
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:08,832
More specific stuff about Hillary

2543
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:14,464
Donald Trump is nothing not rich

2544
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:18,304
Yeah he's a front for some Consortium is on the East Coast

2545
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,376
He's a piece of work

2546
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:22,656
I don't even know what to

2547
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,984
I know it does

2548
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:32,384
It does match some of his life

2549
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,784
Here's why I still think it's relevant even if

2550
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,552
You're holding back

2551
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,832
The reason is

2552
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,368
Whenever

2553
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,416
Whatever he does the

2554
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:48,000
I'm not going to get into it

2555
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,792
A lot of the time

2556
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,096
He's not lying out of whole cloth

2557
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,888
But he's going off of

2558
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,424
Maybe rumor

2559
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,960
Rat you going off of

2560
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:57,984
Insinuation

2561
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:01,312
Horse some piece of information that maybe he can't backup entirely

2562
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:02,848
Something that he's heard

2563
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,896
He knows to be true

2564
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:05,920
Brianna reported

2565
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:09,760
I think that this falls into that

2566
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:11,296
No no matter what

2567
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,088
Unity making something up

2568
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,880
The thing that he's making up

2569
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:17,696
Should preclude him from ever signing up

2570
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:19,488
You would think

2571
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,512
You would think

2572
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:21,792
You would think

2573
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,328
I don't know

2574
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:24,608
Your you're

2575
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,376
Your point is

2576
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:26,144
Completely Valley

2577
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,216
Here is my ticket

2578
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:29,984
So far

2579
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,752
From

2580
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:31,520
What it is

2581
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,288
We talked about

2582
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,056
And how that leads

2583
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,128
Based on

2584
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,712
Can absolutely see

2585
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,248
I can absolutely see

2586
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:43,808
Headphone

2587
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:44,576
Anderson

2588
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:50,208
Meet like it work

2589
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,304
Pretty pretty song

2590
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,328
That we can

2591
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,096
Can assume that

2592
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:58,912
Master narrative

2593
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:01,216
Was

2594
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:03,520
Built to sell

2595
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:04,800
One big a

2596
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:08,896
Right so if we're seeing this at Alex Jones now

2597
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
Then I can

2598
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,456
Can absolutely

2599
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:12,736
That

2600
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,016
Send images

2601
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,064
We are on the Trump

2602
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,600
We're fans of trump

2603
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:20,160
I don't I don't know

2604
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:24,000
My application is ongoing

2605
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:27,584
My conspiracy

2606
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:31,936
These some of the enthusiasm

2607
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,520
In your eyes diminished a little bit because you didn't see me explode

2608
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:36,288
No

2609
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,056
But

2610
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:41,408
I'm just not willing to go that far yet I'm not willing to say that

2611
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:42,688
Alex

2612
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:46,016
I think that's absurd

2613
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:48,576
I know that he's a liar

2614
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,112
I'm at the premise of our show

2615
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:53,696
But I am going to believe

2616
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:56,256
It's not even that I believe

2617
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,560
I'm putting myself into

2618
02:14:58,816 --> 02:14:59,584
Alex's hat

2619
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:03,424
And for him to stay that uniquely our place

2620
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,984
Nose

2621
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
Necessarily

2622
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,592
I'm saying he knows what he thinks he knows

2623
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,896
And what do you think he knows

2624
02:15:13,152 --> 02:15:15,712
Is it Trump is the frontman for Consortium on the east

2625
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,480
Coast

2626
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,784
That is what he thinks he knows

2627
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,576
Right

2628
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:22,624
What is actually real

2629
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:23,904
Who knows

2630
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,208
Who knows

2631
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
Volume

2632
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,608
And the fact that Alex says

2633
02:15:32,864 --> 02:15:33,376
Trump is a

2634
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,192
Videos not wealthy at all

2635
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:37,472
That to me is

2636
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:38,240
Something this week

2637
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:42,848
Define the fine line that you're ignoring I think

2638
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,640
Is the times that he lies

2639
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,688
About these things that you know

2640
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:50,016
He believes those things that he's lying

2641
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,088
Like

2642
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,648
Okay what are you secret sources

2643
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:59,232
They give him information instead

2644
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:02,816
He thinks he has real information

2645
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,376
If that's more important to my investigation

2646
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,400
Then what the truth

2647
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:07,680
Necessarily

2648
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:09,728
I'm interested in why he changed

2649
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:14,336
And write in order to know why he changed we have to know what the Baseline

2650
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:17,408
We have a start point which is that he thinks Trump is global

2651
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:20,992
Before that

2652
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,600
With this Trump situation

2653
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,624
His his

2654
02:16:27,904 --> 02:16:28,928
Very first.

2655
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,976
He hasn't said that

2656
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:33,280
No but he said that he's being set up

2657
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,048
With

2658
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:34,816
Jeb Bush

2659
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:39,680
He's doing a job

2660
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:43,520
Proclamation

2661
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:49,920
He's he's not necessarily saying that Trump is

2662
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:52,480
One of them or anything like that

2663
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,552
He's freezing it the way he's freezing it

2664
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,112
I'm very comfortable saying

2665
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,904
Implying

2666
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,952
Is some knowledge of trump

2667
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,000
That is pretty comfy

2668
02:17:04,256 --> 02:17:05,024
Purple for me

2669
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:06,304
I think

2670
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:09,632
The weather or not he knows

2671
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:11,680
I don't know if I make my point clear

2672
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,960
He believes it

2673
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:16,288
True or false

2674
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:18,592
Is that Alex

2675
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:22,432
That Trump is controlled by outside

2676
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:24,480
Sandy's not really

2677
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:25,248
Yes

2678
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:28,576
It's all any TV show

2679
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:32,160
What is

2680
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,696
What is what was true

2681
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:36,000
I don't many people

2682
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:37,024
Necessarily

2683
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:40,608
Around this time in 2015

2684
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,632
Sing about Trump

2685
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,728
I don't think a whole lot of sources

2686
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,824
Flows through his Casino

2687
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:53,408
Right mob people

2688
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:56,224
Right which is all stuffy

2689
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:59,040
Yeah

2690
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:03,648
And bear out with the facts of our reality that we know now

2691
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,696
It does lend some credence

2692
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
2

2693
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,256
Maybe Alex was right

2694
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:09,792
50

2695
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,120
Yeah

2696
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:16,192
We are sort of that on July 3rd

2697
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:19,008
Right now the 4th of July happened

2698
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:22,336
He's also Fourth of July there's no show

2699
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:24,128
And we come back on the 5th

2700
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:26,944
Everybody's had some nice hot dogs

2701
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:28,736
Already celebrated

2702
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,296
The independence from country

2703
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:35,648
Buckley's been married again

2704
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,440
In the show open

2705
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,720
On July 5th

2706
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:40,768
With a johnbowne report

2707
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:41,792
About

2708
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:42,816
The comment

2709
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:44,096
What's the Trump made about Mexican

2710
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,888
19 days

2711
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:51,776
419

2712
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,568
So why bring it up now

2713
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,104
Yeah it is interest

2714
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:57,152
It is interesting I don't know

2715
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:57,920
So

2716
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:59,200
They get into it

2717
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,808
There's a bunch of stuff about Greece

2718
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,880
About the crisis in Greece

2719
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,184
Most of the episode

2720
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:11,488
It is about

2721
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:14,304
How an immigrant murdered lady on a beach

2722
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:20,960
Stop about that

2723
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:21,728
Covering the Mexican

2724
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:23,264
Can comment

2725
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:27,872
His thing

2726
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,640
But

2727
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
Still

2728
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:31,200
The number of his comment

2729
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,992
Can't be squared

2730
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:33,760
With

2731
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,528
Like

2732
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:36,832
That deeper reason

2733
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:38,880
Yeah here's the first clip

2734
02:19:39,136 --> 02:19:40,928
What about Donald Trump

2735
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:46,560
We did a report

2736
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:48,096
Will get the dog from

2737
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,824
What about

2738
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:07,552
So he does support rhetoric

2739
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:09,088
But you don't trust

2740
02:20:09,344 --> 02:20:11,392
Because he knows things about him

2741
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:14,720
So that is where is headspace is at

2742
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:17,280
A little bit later

2743
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:21,120
Master

2744
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:32,384
I don't trust Donald Trump

2745
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:35,712
Papa Ella

2746
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,208
Pretty much everything Donald Trump shares

2747
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,120
Very accurate

2748
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:01,312
The problem is

2749
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:11,296
HomeSmart casinos

2750
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,280
Republican votes away

2751
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,752
For Hillary

2752
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:35,872
Now what you think

2753
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:39,968
Everyone was so wrong back then even Alex

2754
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:43,296
Jones was wrong back then even Alex

2755
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:48,416
Jones was like this is obvious

2756
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:49,696
Everyone

2757
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:52,768
Including Alex Jones back then

2758
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:55,584
Obvious

2759
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,656
We wouldn't live in the world we do now

2760
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,216
Yeah but

2761
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:04,800
Obviously

2762
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:07,104
He believes everything the Trump says

2763
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,480
Trumpet

2764
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,504
Connected

2765
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:14,784
Yeah

2766
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,552
Alex

2767
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:17,088
Seems to know that

2768
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,048
Denigrates other p

2769
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:32,448
A shady people

2770
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:36,544
Yeah that he doesn't need to talk about

2771
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,336
Because everybody knows

2772
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:46,528
But the rhetoric can't be trusted this guy

2773
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,552
Memes

2774
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:50,880
Vb3 philosophically agrees

2775
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:52,672
With the stuff

2776
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:54,208
No that can't be enough

2777
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:56,768
Navigation

2778
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:57,792
Off the table

2779
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:00,608
Now

2780
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:03,424
You want to know who else isn't on the Trump bandwagon at this point

2781
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,192
Rodger Stone

2782
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,728
Paul Joseph Watson

2783
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,776
What do you think about Trump

2784
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:11,360
I love you

2785
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:21,088
Run

2786
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:26,720
All the candidates he might not be the number one but he's the most likely to have a chance

2787
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:29,024
Defeating Hillary

2788
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:38,240
Is that Reggie Saddler

2789
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:40,288
Inherently corrupt

2790
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:47,968
Everyone

2791
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:48,992
Shift their position

2792
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:49,760
At some point

2793
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:52,320
Rodger Stone

2794
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:56,672
If I brought it up earlier Rodger Stones not around he's exact

2795
02:23:56,928 --> 02:23:57,440
The turning point

2796
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,464
That's when it happens

2797
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,768
I'm Rodger Stone I don't know

2798
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,888
Things start to change

2799
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,168
If that

2800
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,704
Leads into

2801
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,544
I don't think Alex made a choice

2802
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:13,824
You don't think so

2803
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,104
I think someone

2804
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:18,944
Maybe some of these mob ties

2805
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:20,736
Discuss

2806
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,528
I think someone might have something

2807
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:23,808
On Alex

2808
02:24:26,624 --> 02:24:32,512
Now that might think you don't think it's just the opportunity

2809
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,816
Just kind of

2810
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,864
Using Alex

2811
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,888
You like Alex

2812
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:39,168
Very easily

2813
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:43,008
Alex is a dumb

2814
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:49,664
Someone with candy and promises he will get into

2815
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:53,504
Your Russian band is much more likely but I like

2816
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,040
To keep the suspense

2817
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:57,856
Of the possibility

2818
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:00,416
12C the only thing there is that

2819
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:01,696
We already have plenty of

2820
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,512
The story like

2821
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:05,536
Rodger Stone

2822
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:10,656
Like all of this all of this s*** is more than enough

2823
02:25:11,168 --> 02:25:12,192
The fact that it

2824
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:13,472
But like it doesn't need

2825
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:14,240
Trickle-down

2826
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:15,008
Alex

2827
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:16,288
The actual compromise

2828
02:25:16,544 --> 02:25:21,920
Stuff to a certain extent is irrelevant to my investigation

2829
02:25:22,432 --> 02:25:24,480
Like the Senate investigate

2830
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:25,760
Talking Rodger Stone

2831
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,296
Like that's their business

2832
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:32,416
You don't you don't need to go after Alex

2833
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,184
U8

2834
02:25:33,696 --> 02:25:37,024
It's I mean I mean for the Russian mob ties

2835
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,048
Splatter

2836
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:39,840
You don't need to compromise Alex

2837
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,400
I don't know

2838
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:46,240
Like I don't think I don't think so I think that Alex Jones

2839
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:49,056
Having a career that's built on being anti

2840
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:50,592
People being corrupt

2841
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:54,176
Even though he's corrupt himself of his gold sales

2842
02:25:59,296 --> 02:25:59,808
I think

2843
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:02,368
He were to stuff out

2844
02:26:02,624 --> 02:26:03,648
That people were trying to

2845
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,416
Just wait him

2846
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:05,696
In a corrupt

2847
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:08,768
Backfire on people trying

2848
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:12,864
You are a few are giving his abilities

2849
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:13,632
Things out

2850
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:15,424
High Praise

2851
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:18,752
Pepperoni

2852
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,992
I still hold up illness

2853
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:33,600
Total brain that he's broke

2854
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:35,392
I get that and I agree with you

2855
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:38,976
But for the drama of the factories

2856
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:44,864
Where do we spend our episodes episodes of his investigation

2857
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,168
We got at least

2858
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:48,704
Maybe we'll find proof

2859
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,752
Compromise

2860
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:54,080
Your version is way more likely

2861
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:58,688
I can see exactly what your

2862
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:04,832
I want to believe

2863
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:05,600
Listen

2864
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:08,672
I'm fine I'm just going okay

2865
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,464
Set the timer

2866
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:15,584
Look the reality is you're probably right you dumb

2867
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,888
Invariant

2868
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:23,520
Basically basically

2869
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:24,288
Stories

2870
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:30,688
Anderson for the 20 years of indoctrinating

2871
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:31,968
Radicalized

2872
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,552
But

2873
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:37,344
It's super important

2874
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,136
That he does say

2875
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,184
That Trump has established

2876
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,744
Right but he doesn't go as far as

2877
02:27:45,024 --> 02:27:47,328
That he's a globalist

2878
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:49,120
That is important to me

2879
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:53,472
Layton inasmuch as this investigation is about what happened

2880
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:54,496
His whole

2881
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:56,544
Journey and path with Trump

2882
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:58,848
Like the fact that he's just like

2883
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:00,896
It's not even the globe

2884
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:01,920
8-bit

2885
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:03,456
Cute f****** mobbed-up

2886
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:05,504
Yeah that is weird

2887
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,808
That's such a weird angle of attack for him

2888
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,416
Conversation

2889
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:16,000
Opportunistically to get

2890
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:18,048
F****** promotion for his show

2891
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:19,840
And he's not even a relevant thing

2892
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:23,424
Here's here's who he's really on board with he says it on there

2893
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,984
He makes it very clear

2894
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,800
Bucks

2895
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:30,592
Ted Cruz really liking

2896
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:36,736
It's some bad stuff like support

2897
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,880
So I mean

2898
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:45,440
Crystal Clear is Rand Paul

2899
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:49,280
Contradiction

2900
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:51,072
With what he ends up doing

2901
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:54,912
Walking out Ted Cruz so hard

2902
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:57,472
He attacked him because Papa Jackson

2903
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:58,240
Something we all say

2904
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:01,824
He goes from this position

2905
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:05,408
I like some

2906
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:07,968
Stop I like bigotry

2907
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:10,784
But I can't trust him because of these things that I know

2908
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,064
He goes from

2909
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,856
Trump is our savior

2910
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:15,136
And how

2911
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:15,904
Do you make that shift

2912
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:18,464
He goes from not mentioning him for

2913
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,488
16 days

2914
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:21,536
After announcing his candidacy

2915
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:25,376
He spends his time for Chick-fil-A

2916
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:28,192
And s*** like it's nonsense for that 16 days

2917
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:30,496
And when he finally starts talkin about Trump

2918
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,288
It's with awareness

2919
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:34,592
Dismissal and I don't trust

2920
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,896
The journey from there

2921
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:38,432
To where we end up

2922
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,224
I think it's going to be one of the most

2923
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,504
Bizarre

2924
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,296
Things that every Bart

2925
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:45,600
So join us next time

2926
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:48,160
God damn you

2927
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,512
Will be back

2928
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:56,864
Monster

2929
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,960
Of course of what's going on on the Alex Jones Show

2930
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:06,080
On the background doing all this research

2931
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:08,640
I had another installment shortly

2932
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:09,920
Of the next week

2933
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:11,968
And Alex Jones 2015

2934
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,248
And we will see

2935
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,528
What I can learn

2936
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,808
I agree with you

2937
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,880
Probably not as Sensational as I hope

2938
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,160
But I have hope

2939
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:23,232
I find something really f***** up

2940
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,048
Here's my prediction

2941
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:29,120
It's going to be

2942
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,680
Like maybe

2943
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:33,472
Maybe to throw you a bone on

2944
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:35,008
Come on

2945
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,592
Rodger Stone holding the stick

2946
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,616
Problem

2947
02:30:39,872 --> 02:30:40,896
He's going to like

2948
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:42,176
Because Trump

2949
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:45,504
Like I think 8 is promises that were made

2950
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,552
Hey

2951
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:48,576
Get on board

2952
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:49,344
Because

2953
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:51,392
We are going to end

2954
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:56,000
If you get some Patron.

2955
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:58,560
He will come on your show and talk about how great you are

2956
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:01,888
I think it's I think it's also Trump never planted

2957
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:08,288
No Trump wanted to like the theory holds that Trump wanted to start Fox News

2958
02:31:08,544 --> 02:31:09,312
And that alley

2959
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:10,848
Get a prominent

2960
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:13,152
But even even if

2961
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:15,712
Blackmail

2962
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:19,552
If you don't

2963
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:20,320
Then trumpsc

2964
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,600
Going to come after you

2965
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:24,416
I think it's going to come back

2966
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:25,184
To being a money

2967
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:31,840
Even play

2968
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:38,496
Reputable gold and silver lyrics video

2969
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:39,776
Look rich

2970
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,080
You're going

2971
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:47,968
Smart to fall for your trip

2972
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,552
I don't know

2973
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:53,088
I don't know what would you

2974
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:55,648
What would you do if you were

2975
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,208
Formerly reputable golden silver sales

2976
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,232
The salesman

2977
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,024
What do you tell

2978
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:02,048
Alex

2979
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:05,888
Like how what's your best angle to cells throughout

2980
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:09,216
I honestly think that if you're smart

2981
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:10,752
Senor Ted Anderson you want

2982
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:12,032
Hillary to win

2983
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:17,152
Everybody wanted Hillary to win I don't think it would be wise

2984
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,944
If you're trying to scare people

2985
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,224
The really support Trump

2986
02:32:22,272 --> 02:32:23,040
From the gun manufacturer

2987
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:26,624
I've been selling at an all-time low

2988
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:29,440
Because of course

2989
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:33,280
You're not afraid that Obama

2990
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:36,864
Your guns away

2991
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,704
Everyone's best in

2992
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,776
Trump to lose

2993
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:45,056
Like

2994
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:50,432
I think if you're a propaganda

2995
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:52,224
Reno

2996
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:55,808
Employees one

2997
02:32:56,064 --> 02:32:56,832
In order to sell his goal

2998
02:32:57,856 --> 02:33:00,160
He doesn't with a lot of other stuff too like

2999
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:02,976
The all these conspiracy websites

3000
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:04,256
Resources ads on them

3001
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:14,752
If your

3002
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:20,384
Network

3003
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,176
Which include some other shows that are not

3004
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,456
Nearly as popular

3005
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,296
And you were dictating Alex's

3006
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,320
Position

3007
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:30,624
I think the smart thing to do

3008
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:31,648
Is there

3009
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:33,184
Look he's not going to win

3010
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,976
But you stay on that ramp

3011
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:38,048
Combination

3012
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,328
You just make

3013
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:40,352
Hey

3014
02:33:40,608 --> 02:33:42,400
Idaho you should have won the nomination

3015
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,680
And f*** both of these

3016
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:47,008
Right that's a smart move if you want to keep selling gold

3017
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:48,800
Your smartest move of

3018
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:49,568
Well yeah

3019
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:51,872
Because then if you if you're going against both of

3020
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,528
Look Trump

3021
02:33:58,784 --> 02:34:00,320
Is Justice Carrie is Hillary

3022
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,088
Pinpoint to the picture

3023
02:34:01,344 --> 02:34:02,112
Pictures of them together you

3024
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:02,880
You can do that

3025
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:03,648
Angle on it

3026
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:04,928
And that is a

3027
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:05,696
Fear narrative

3028
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:11,328
Your butt if you when you're sad

3029
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,400
Risky gamble for propaganda

3030
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:20,800
I think he would have a choice unless there was something else motive

3031
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:23,872
He's built a business

3032
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:26,432
Set up to 2015 with fairies accept

3033
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:27,968
It's boiled

3034
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:34,368
You still like you built an amazing thing

3035
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:36,160
You can't do that if you're an idiot

3036
02:34:36,416 --> 02:34:38,464
You can't do that

3037
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,768
You can't do that if you don't

3038
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,816
Make some decent strategic

3039
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:43,840
Choices

3040
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:46,400
And I don't think he would be dumb enough

3041
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:47,680
The shackle himself

3042
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:49,472
With an inconsistent

3043
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:51,776
Possibly mentally degrading candidate

3044
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:53,568
The president

3045
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:55,872
That he's going to have to

3046
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:59,456
Keep with him yet he knows he's negative

3047
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:01,504
Eddie knows that he can't trust

3048
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:04,576
So I think that there has to be

3049
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:07,392
I know I think they're how dare you

3050
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:08,672
Cliffhanger like this

3051
02:35:09,184 --> 02:35:14,048
Cereal with happening now

3052
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,704
Jesus Christ

3053
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:27,104
To be fair we did try and get send an email to the cereal people

3054
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:33,504
No response

3055
02:35:35,808 --> 02:35:36,320
The cereal

3056
02:35:40,672 --> 02:35:43,744
Do you guys want us to be on some sort of a f****** that works we can make some money

3057
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:50,912
Gmail.com

3058
02:35:51,168 --> 02:35:51,680
Score fight

3059
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:54,752
Cracked.com

3060
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:59,360
I will have posted

3061
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:01,152
I knew functionality on the web

3062
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,456
Built a calendar

3063
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,992
The ever-growing

3064
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,272
In terms of

3065
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:07,296
With the content that's on

3066
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:08,832
But as it is now

3067
02:36:09,088 --> 02:36:09,856
I posted

3068
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,464
From the month of June 2015

3069
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:18,304
Each episode on that bass show

3070
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:20,352
And I'm going to keep

3071
02:36:20,608 --> 02:36:21,120
Keep updating it

3072
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:24,192
As we go along also building the current

3073
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,544
If you just want information

3074
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:32,384
Without listening the 3-hour episode about what was going on on this day

3075
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:39,040
Right going to be information there about Meredith who's pitching

3076
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,064
So we can

3077
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:42,368
We all have memories

3078
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,392
Fell

3079
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:50,048
Keep banks on it

3080
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:53,632
Exactly gold bag

3081
02:36:56,704 --> 02:37:01,056
To give you an idea of the Staggering level of work that Dan is doing

3082
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:03,104
Just

3083
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,896
Look at this website it's f******

3084
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:09,504
Banana notebook

3085
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:10,528
It's

3086
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:14,368
Generally I don't do this but

3087
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:16,160
Become a policy walk

3088
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,184
Because

3089
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,208
F******

3090
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:24,608
This is insane

3091
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:26,656
No

3092
02:37:27,168 --> 02:37:27,936
Terrified

3093
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:29,984

A lot

3098
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:44,832
Let me rephrase that if we have 45 million dollars

3099
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:51,232
Full-time job

3100
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:53,280
Imagine what I could find

3101
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:55,840
Golden Chick

3102
02:37:56,096 --> 02:37:56,864

What's up

3108
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,368
