00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
Jordan

2
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Knowledge fight knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy or the bad guy

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
Knowledge

4
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Alex

5
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
College.com

6
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:06,048
I'm a little bit about Alex

7
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,656
Indeed we are.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
My bright spot today is

9
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
We

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
What fun I don't know what am I doing

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
What does has become weaker celebration celebration

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Celebration

13
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
It said yeah you can celebrate the sneak candy do we have the interview with reliable so

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Sources Brian stelter on Sunday

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Monday we have of the world exclusive interview with the lawyers extended Bill Ogden

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
So funny that we do

17
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
Then Becca Lewis on Tuesday but

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
In order for sneak week to really be sneaky

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
You expect shows always playing

20
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:05,440
We snuck and we didn't have something on Wednesday and do you know what else when people think

21
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
We bag

22
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,608
That's when we're going to dog baby radio but I worry because Zog means

23
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Occupied government

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
I have to put an embargo on that joke

25
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
Yeah but

26
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:31,552
We have about the trial time

27
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,952
Time and getting up to speed on a lot of that stuff right and then Friday we cap off sneak week

28
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
With an appearance on the majority report

29
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,704
I think I maybe I don't know I've been looking forward to that

30
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
I have been a big fan of salmon to his work

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
And so I guess I'm looking forward to absolutely

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Septapus to Sam the entire time

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
But you're going to have a tough time not doing home movies

34
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
Do you remember when you played the the vampire guy

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
And you were like I forget everything you know about how you remember that be great

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,664
I have thoughts about like various interviews he's at with academics authors

37
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
Debate these donors libertarian

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Stocktwits

39
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
Steven Crowder voice acting

40
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah there we go

41
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
My bright spot is I put it up I finished it I compiled all of the

42
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
Annoying tweets that I made and I got rid of all the insults and all of the personal tax and all of the anything that

43
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
At the trial because

44
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
I wanted to share a disorienting experience with people there's going to be way better

45
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Books written about it

46
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
That make more sense in that will be enjoyable to read

47
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
But you won't get the real experience of being there I think it was disorienting a none enjoyed I think a lot of people

48
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
People are going to resolve the lack of insults I think people are going to want salt

49
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Well problem you've cultivated probably more like now

50
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
Here's the problem the final draft

51
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Fifty thousand words in

52
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
I don't know if you recall what I said the initial amount of total words I've written over the side.

53
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
No 20000 cutout I know how to take care of things

54
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
20000

55
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
Play ratio my website the quiet part loud it's the front page

56
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
DeBarge

57
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Existed

58
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:08,223
All it is is that you can download it as PDF PDF

59
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,087
Don't pay anything for it I don't give anybody anything for it donate

60
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
Body or just read it

61
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Well

62
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
What fun for everyone who is wondering where are those

63
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Had a good time you're at your new job you refer to

64
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,711
I got a gig one time and it is death for me it is

65
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Schoolboy night anyway to describe

66
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
Because somebody's paying you to do it

67
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Edits sad

68
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
One of the trial coverage

69
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Surrounding

70
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
Iora in some

71
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
Surrounding stuff will be a little bit more in the next episode is going on

72
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Over the

73
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,271
Testimony that Alex gave at the trial

74
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
Which I didn't expect we were going to cover cuz I thought all that stuff was like you can't make copies of this but then

75
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,535
Blonde crime that so

76
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,911
Nothing you can do about it videos

77
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
Are you smell that audio

78
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
So we're going to cover Alex's

79
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
The the

80
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
Direct questioning from Reno and then the cross-examination

81
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,343
We're going to get into the aftermath of the

82
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
Compensatory damages going to leave off Alex's response to the compensatory

83
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Damages

84
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,863
Waiting for the next day when he will end up in the punitive fiction

85
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Okay so that is that is what part one will cover and then part 2 will pick up and go from there

86
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,383
One is is far from home and then the next one is endgame

87
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
I forgot how these

88
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967

It may be easier to just pronounce the Michaela my mom was a creative spellers

103
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Michaela

You are now a technocrat

109
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,823
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites

110
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Has a Caribbean

111
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
I don't want

112
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Jesus Christ so much we begin

113
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
With Alex being sworn in

114
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
I do think

115
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
But this isn't going to be a complete play-by-play of everything that happened

116
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
Honestly anyone who listens to our show be like this is boring

117
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
This is

118
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
You know

119
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,991
That was a lot of experience of us being in the room for especially as first day of just being like

120
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Are you doing an ad read right now real include that but Alex

121
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
And he's try he tries to take

122
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
A piece of paper up to the stand with him

123
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
Which causes a little problem

124
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
I do

125
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Call Alex

126
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Steve Jones

127
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Water and

128
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Pretty good volume

129
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Look at any

130
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
The lawyers

131
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Myself

132
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
So I'm going to ask

133
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,047
It's fun about that is that you know Alex is so invested in the teleprompter

134
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
You know and I need strength to bring handwritten notes

135
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
The fact that they were handwritten to likes come on

136
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
Really yeah I mean on some level I get it I get the impulse

137
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
I would rather have.

138
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
Answer whatever question is

139
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Butts

140
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
Yeah you can't you don't get to do that

141
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
Yeah I mean

142
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
We were this wasn't day one of the trial no

143
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
You know like we have already saved live

144
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
We've already experienced was Tuesday

145
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
I know this would have been a 7

146
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
V6

147
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,615
Yesterday six of the trial proper

148
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
If you don't count count Arizona

149
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
So

150
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
But it like

151
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
Weird scene for a week everyone come unprepared and then they had a weekend

152
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Cuz what we have not discussed it up till this point you already had Owen Shroyer you already had diarrhea

153
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
You already had Becca you already had will zip yeah yeah mister Crouch

154
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
And so if you're already had like a real contrast and the Infowars people and the

155
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,175
Witnesses that were being called by the plaintiff's in terms of variability

156
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
2

157
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Sure

158
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,647
I do Alex comes up all I also didn't include the part where he was scolded for chewing gum and then tried

159
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
We have some things to talk about

160
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,471
So when all comes in with his first question the things they

161
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,567
I think becomes abundantly clear really fast is that Alex does not appreciate

162
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,895
The notion of not being able to ramble

163
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
It's one of the things that he has it's the most sacred to him

164
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
He does not respond well to being told

165
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
You have to answer questions

166
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Alex Wood

167
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Yourself to the ladies and gentle

168
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
How are you feeling today

169
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
49

170
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,007
Instead of the corporate media

171
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
I want to

172
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Start bike

173
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Letting the jury know a little bit about

174
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
And where

175
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Questions

176
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,431
So you can see here the in the first question Alex's asked he's already off track

177
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,807
He's trying to monologue in control the entirety of the conversation because he

178
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
He think you should be able to

179
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,207
Imagine that rental has had any success ever trying to keep Alex on point

180
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
Like off the sand so why should this be any different

181
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,655
At the end Alex says that it's not fair that he doesn't get to talk but she got to monologue

182
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
This isn't reference to Scarlet Lewis's testimony from just prior to him taking the sand and there's a reason why she got to monologue

183
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Guess I'll explain it

184
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,431
It's because rain all knew damn well that he wasn't going to objecting interrupter

185
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,831
There is much of a s*** head is he seems to be I don't think right now is so detached from his Humanity as to deprive Miss Lewis

186
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,135
Of her chance to speak her piece to Alex

187
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,255
After all this time and him dodging the moment of having to look her in the face and hear her words

188
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Truth be told

189
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Louis probably was a bit off subject at a few points in her testimony and if reynald have ejected there's a real

190
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
Really good chance that the judge would have no choice but to refocus the question

191
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
But he didn't do that

192
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,943
And that's what Alex is mad about

193
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,503
You hit your lawyer didn't stop it

194
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
Right right right yeah I mean

195
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
It does seem like what is really causing Alex Eyre

196
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Is that his lawyer did not

197
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Badger Scarlett Lewis with questions

198
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
Or interrupt her answers of rush into that says appointed attorneys right

199
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Sprinter you understand why we're here

200
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
I think that it would have taken a really cold cold lawyer

201
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
Your son.

202
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Dark.

203
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,927
Alex doesn't want to stress as he was trying to sidebar that he was going down

204
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,535
I'll bet he apologized and he's sorry and all that so

205
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
Have you been one

206
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Apologize

207
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Yes

208
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
What would you like

209
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,895
Intentionally try to hurt you

210
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
Couple years ago

211
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
Questions questions

212
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Hanover that

213
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Her sister.

214
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
That's really been

215
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
I personally

216
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
This morning

217
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
I said I believe

218
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
That

219
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
I believe they're being manipulated

220
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
This apartment

221
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Pizza Perfect

222
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Oh my God

223
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
I was just lost power through my God so the clip he's talking about is something we went over on our

224
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
7-Eleven episode

225
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,935
Alex talking about how Jeslyn appeared slow

226
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,263
At all that's use he's trying to argue that this is a

227
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,151
Got a selectively edited everybody whatever his argument was essentially

228
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
You didn't play the whole clip

229
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
See what happened is the first thing I said was I'm sorry and then I said that because

230
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Slow and that I

231
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
Think he is on the Spectrum this is not an apology that is Alex attempting to defend himself by saying that he

232
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,375
Mean to hurt anyone and he didn't actually even say things I would hurt them to begin with because

233
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,959
No people just take things he says out of context and attack him

234
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
This is pathetic

235
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,175
It's not about recognizing and respecting the pain that other people experience due to your actions

236
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,039
It's about pretending that you care they were hurt and that it was someone else's fault

237
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
It's cowardly but it's to be expected

238
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,927
Yeah I mean if you follow his words he's essentially saying

239
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Basically

240
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
You're not smart enough to understand why what I did was actually okay Maya Cusick

241
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,679
Is that you just don't understand like you're mad at me

242
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
But really it's your fault

243
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
Right I didn't hurt you it's media lying about the things that I said I don't even know who you are

244
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
I never said your name

245
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,063
Yeah a very respectful thing to say in your defamation trial is a honestly I didn't even know who you were

246
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,463
It doesn't matter to me who might hurt it's almost Dickies and bison in the Street Fighter movie

247
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
Little bit like wow you are a real villain here today that I came to your village is the most important day of your life for me

248
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Not great

249
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
Serana wants to humanize Alex obviously a part of this is walking through some of his earlier

250
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
Your life

251
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Cut clips from all of it

252
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Some stuff that just seem like this doesn't match up at all right now it's usually talk

253
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Years of the first of that

254
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Let us know where

255
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
Where are you from

256
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
How old were you

257
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Add

258
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
You tell them

259
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
Why your fam

260
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Too much crime in Dallas

261
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Hoo-boy

262
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
You lived in Rockwall

263
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,927
Too much crime and Wealthy suburb

264
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
Documentary

265
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
Everybody's rolling around and rolls-royces and doing

266
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,615
There's too much wage stuff going on let me know there was a lot of crime going on in that neighborhood

267
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Service employees were paid to little people he was

268
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
Round were not paying their employees well

269
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,951
You know what I respect that he knew better than to do the

270
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
I grew up in a town where a Satanist or trying to recruit me

271
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
To worshipping the devil because they knew that

272
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,703
I threw psychic powers the devil gave them I would be important to God's mission in the future

273
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:30,591
And I uncovered a drug ring within the Rockwall police department and they threatened to murder me if I didn't leave town

274
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
I think that maybe he knew that the jury would

275
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:39,039
Not take kindly to that it's clearly ridiculous

276
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
Be a little bit like the jury's punitive damages at that point would have to come back with like and he has to wear a straitjacket

277
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Forever like that if you say that on the stand punitive damages stop being money I think I was pretty lucky that

278
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,983
This is not one of those in Upper formativa judge

279
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
So

280
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
Alex talks about some of his early influence

281
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
And this was one of those points were almost had to leave the courtroom

282
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
How old were you

283
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Felt that you wanted

284
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
17 hour radio

285
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Dylan radio

286
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
Radio

287
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
Also like Howard Stern the volume is fine

288
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,688
You like CNM you like the Clinton News Network

289
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Please

290
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
This is a strategic answer on Alex's bar because he doesn't want to say to the jury that he was brought up listening to and admiring

291
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Extreme far-right demagogues

292
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,464
And Christian identity radio preachers

293
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,096
He doesn't want to say to the jury that he was a devoted fan of the British Israelite preacher David Jay Smith

294
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,448
Or have you as a regular listener to the holocaust-denying preacher text Mars

295
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,776
Who is church Alex has said repeatedly that he attempts

296
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
He doesn't want to even tell the version of the story that he related and his documentary Alex's War because even though

297
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
Larry King and Howard Stern are largely mainstream touchstones and they do sort of shows that Alex wants the jury to

298
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Think he does

299
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,024
Its total b******* but it's also very clear why he's presenting his inspiration to get it to mediate this way

300
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,120
So the jury doesn't get an accurate sense of what his career has actually been about

301
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,728
Also kind of makes Alex leave Moyers editing choices look even more embarrassing

302
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
The use of swelling music over Alex telling the tale of how he discovered people bring the fight to the New World Order on public access

303
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
That was the moment he realized he wanted to get into this field

304
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Particularly dumb now

305
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,672
Just imagine the same music that she played over Alex and I really like Larry King's radio show they Wanted host

306
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
The chat program like

307
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
Knock knock. Quite so then let the same flare it is maybe you got played or maybe you wanted to be played

308
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,264
It is so very funny to me the idea of having made a documentary and then only days later

309
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,312
Hear your subject

310
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,456
It's almost completely disavow every single thing in that documentary yeah Underoath

311
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,856
I'm also like I don't know I'm getting recent Awards Vibes in terms of like

312
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
I think it was a lot of

313
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Ramping up

314
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,584
Do it and it seems like no one care done

315
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,984
I don't know I mean I feel almost like I'm dumb for doing as much work

316
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,592
I kind of thought it would be a little bit more widely

317
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Disgusting and maybe viewed

318
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
Then it then it was

319
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,504
Preemptive

320
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,904
For the creamer I mean they had some big names pre-marketing it you know like the interview is Greenwald it feels like

321
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
That should move the needle somewhat right and there were ostensibly order a lot of priori

322
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Orders online which take however you want

323
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
I don't know

324
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,728
Alex's early show

325
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,264
30 did beginning of the

326
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Different yes then the current weight

327
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
And what was the format of

328
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Early shows

329
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
Amazon

330
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
TV

331
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Just watch.

332
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Okay

333
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
That's complete bulshit

334
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:51,968
Baby Alex did do a bit of goofing off on his show but it was also straight-up conspiracy contact

335
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
When is early public-access co-host Jeff Davis made a documentary together titled are you practicing

336
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
Communism if that gives you some time to the vibe he was working with back then

337
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Hit really hard to get your hands on the shows from back then but the ones I've seen are complete b******* and conspiracy late

338
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
Nonsense

339
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,520
And it's super easy to find accounts from people who worked at the station with him back then

340
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,152
He was a raving conspiracy lunatic even back then he was an a****** and no one like working with him

341
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,760
That's why that's a big part of why his career took the trajectory

342
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:31,136
It would be it would have been more fun if that was like a PSA where it's like they're like

343
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
Are you practicing your piano lessons your like are you practicing your communism you're working on your confidence

344
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,168
Practice makes perfect Ru going to communist in Carnegie Hall is the question that you should be asking yourself

345
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:49,568
Yeah yeah I tried to watch that documentary I had to go

346
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,456
Get a table complaining about Tommy

347
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah it just was like

348
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,136
I can't I'm not going to do this there was no flayer

349
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Nothing

350
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
No worries nothing anti-communist

351
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Terrible

352
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
But look man Alex Alex

353
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
Love Letter game

354
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Courts

355
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
About Larry King

356
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Who would you say

357
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
Do artistic leave

358
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Format

359
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Your show

360
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
If Alex's dad listen to Larry King it was

361
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
Yelling at him

362
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:51,008
Larry King and Big Mike's Service f****** communist

363
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
I would almost believe that

364
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,824
And here's why

365
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
The Alex's need to interrupt over the TV

366
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:03,296
Sad to have come from somewhere I think it's entirely possible that he did watch his dad

367
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:07,136
Just interrupt Larry King screaming at the TV all the time

368
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
It's an interesting Theory

369
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,536
I think of that could just be a style he developed totally totally

370
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,888
Attention span highly knee-jerk reactive

371
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
But yeah I know you do what you see sometimes you know I'm just saying that I'm aging and now

372
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Recognizing my my father's actions in my own and this is a tire lie about me I have no idea what we're talking about

373
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Can't relate to that at all locked himself in a room only works all the time

374
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
Touches on his first documentary

375
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
A real fun climb

376
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Did you also start make

377
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
In order to

378
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Supporting for

379
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Did you also start

380
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Documentary

381
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
A documentary

382
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
America's Choice

383
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Oh yeah that right

384
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
25

385
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,208
See this is like so indicative of Alex's s***

386
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Like this

387
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,328
Pretending that his first documentary was about the great reset

388
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,424
Something that didn't become a Hot Topic in conspiracy circles until

389
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
2021 death basically like

390
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
This is so

391
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,848
This is what he's about he's about Reckoning

392
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:35,200
These things that he yelled about in the past and then applies modern

393
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
Labels and contacts to them in order to make it look like Alex Jones was always right

394
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:49,280
But you weren't yelling about the great reset

395
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,680
Texas the road through what was it what was it oh yeah yeah yeah

396
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:02,080
Transatlantic North American Highway corridor

397
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
Sign up sheet in them

398
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
You get off at 8 was it is like

399
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,272
We talked about it with with Market bill just a little bit but it is like

400
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,856
You can't really have a jury of Alex's peers

401
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,672
Out of anybody that's that doesn't like

402
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,280
How can you say oh you're you can't lie under oath to that

403
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:27,680
Like you and I both know that that's a complete lie I know I was going to say it I don't know if that's a substance

404
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,496
Reply to the totally totally maybe it's

405
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Kind of fine for the proceedings of this that

406
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,480
No it's legally all that it is but there is a certain part of me that's like

407
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,576
You have to be able to know that Alex is lying even about

408
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
That

409
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
You know

410
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Sure

411
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Yeah I agree with that

412
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:53,024
I think that this runs into the issue of the separate realities

413
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,864
Because you know there's a part of Alex that probably believes

414
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,520
Absolutely had I was two years old

415
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
Reset the Lord spoken to me how does narcissism work and its effect on whether or not you think

416
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
You're being truthful

417
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,784
Yeah I know like and that's something they'll be difficult to unpack but I would say

418
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Beto Thornhill oath

419
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,392
You're a fool if you think Alex is ever going to like

420
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
Actually give you truthful answers

421
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
A x answers

422
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,072
So we get back to talking about

423
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
The time of Sandy Hook

424
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Alex's show

425
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,544
And what was his show like what was the environmental Infowars

426
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
You tell us what

427
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
Segments are that would appear

428
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Hiiraan

429
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Awards

430
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
4 Hour radio show

431
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,720
12

432
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
I want to watch online

433
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
And then

434
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,736
The primary goal of Alex's answer here is to downplay his own relevance in the size of his operation in 2012

435
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
He wants the jury to think that though he's a big famous boy now back then he's really just popped

436
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:23,904
Talk show

437
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Unfortunately he's lying

438
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
He didn't just have a webcam on a desk at that point he had to Studios each with multiple camera angles of a

439
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Available at any point

440
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
He also had more than just his show being broadcast daily since the Infowars Nightly News was in existence at that point

441
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,176
The Nightly News started in 2011

442
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Instances of Rob do covering Sandy Hook

443
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
Alex knows all

444
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,672
But the goal is to create the perception that he really wasn't that big back then so it couldn't have been him that was so influential

445
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,792
And getting the Sandy Hook conspiracies rolling and causing the harm that was done to Niall and Scarlett

446
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
It's a fraud pretending a show he produced all the way to 2017 doesn't

447
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Exist

448
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Knox

449
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Never heard of it before what's this I never heard of it before

450
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,432
I was I was thinking about this I can't think of any

451
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
Testimony

452
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,528
Real or fictional I have ever seen

453
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,624
That may be more Chuck filled with absolute non truths you know

454
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
And it is

455
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
It is like you were saying you know like

456
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:36,352
That's because in this world I don't think we're ever dealing with a truth or a lie that doesn't exist through dealing with both

457
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
And neither simultaneous know what's convenient and useful to me is the truth is the truth

458
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,056
And I believe it under a lie detector

459
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Yeah

460
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
And I think that's

461
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,712
It's bizarre because you know

462
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
Narcissism for Alex Works in this way of like

463
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
All right when I need to inflate my self write in 2012 the biggest show in the world in 100

464
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
Marine radio station every world leader on the planet items to my shopping list

465
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
President

466
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
Owned one of those explicitly say that

467
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,872
Narcissism here is that he needs to not be very big

468
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
Because

469
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
It's important for him

470
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
To not have the grand title of the things that is make it right

471
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
Psychopaths is that the manipulating based on what they people think want to hear in any situation is that one of those

472
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
That sounds right

473
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,888
So with this next place is where Alex gets to talking about the

474
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
Howard talk show host

475
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
And

476
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
This is bizarre

477
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Time

478
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
How did you

479
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Stories that you

480
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
You wanted to come

481
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
Talk radio

482
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,648
95%

483
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,048
For what do you make of this

484
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Is that

485
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
We worship with you and talk radio.

486
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
Fat collars when you think of that do you buy that

487
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
What do you think's going to happen next

488
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,840
Basically keep noticing

489
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,400
Who has made the best protection

490
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,288
Showbox

491
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Is people speculating

492
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
Gyros

493
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,432
Alondra Park

494
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
Okay

495
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,720
That is one of the most absurd descriptions of like five different things I've ever heard

496
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,280
Exactly

497
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
He thinks that like his audience is sitting there with a pen and a pad ready

498
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:26,080
It's like it's like their head they have baseball score cards they're like single on this one

499
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,640
Draw one lights

500
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:35,040
Rush Limbaugh hits one out of the park I mean look from the time that we've been doing this show and the predictions that

501
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
We've seen from him if anyone was doing this

502
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
And talk show host who were judge by this

503
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Qbr business

504
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
Outlier

505
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Cars

506
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:56,544
Fortunate no one is keeping up a notepad goddamn

507
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,944
The world would have to have been destroyed multiple times over by now in order for his prediction said Annie

508
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:07,552
Decent tracker absolutely would be constantly getting nuked

509
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
Write the globalists would be

510
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,440
Starving everyone and we would all be dead of

511
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:20,096
A plague of locust and this is how Alex always kind of gets into your head

512
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,496
I dislike that is so insane that you almost forget he said that free speech is really just a dude stand

513
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
Sitting on a box in the corner he was in London screaming for 6

514
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,456
2u Jungkook by their predictions

515
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,784
But then you judge their predictions by how long they stayed in the stocks

516
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,856
I think that might actually be a better situation for us

517
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Ma'am you have enough bad prediction to go to the stocks for a week I think that that is your right there

518
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
It is one of the tools of Alex's absurdity

519
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
There's constant heightening there's so many layers and up there to die so you're like

520
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Part B is

521
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,872
Parties hilarious part D what are you talkin about what happened

522
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
Emma in a conversation about sources Alex

523
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:11,040
I said I want this person

524
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,576
That person

525
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,928
Five more control of the jet

526
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Touching

527
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Because

528
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,480
Costco

529
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,624
It's b******* that Alex is saying there's a moratorium on this kind of sourcing like some things on 4chan

530
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
If you want to take this seriously at all

531
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:55,328
Then what Alex needs to do is take a cut like a real hard look in the mirror

532
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,424
Take an inventory of the things that you said based on

533
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
14 posts

534
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,592
And retract all of it he needs to go back and look at the like

535
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,152
Soros antifa contract

536
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
You need to go back and find all of these things and really wrestle with like OK Google know this to be

537
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,928
A completely unreliable source do you need to figure out what parts

538
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:26,304
Of your mythology what parts of your worldview are solely informed by that

539
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,704
And work to get those out that make sure that people don't still believe them cuz otherwise you're still using

540
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,848
Orrtanna thesaurus essentially

541
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Are two important thing

542
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,248
Yeah I know if you find out a single cop used to be a drug dealer for 10 years

543
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,624
Every single case that that cop worked on needs to be re-evaluated and thrown out or whatever so

544
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,232
It's the same thing it's the same fundamental principles it's hard work

545
00:38:55,488 --> 00:39:01,120
It is very hard work

546
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:07,520
Did the result is going to be good for him to find another way to try and prove it Soros has

547
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Tifa contract

548
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
To burn down cities which is

549
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,944
A real big part of your whole bulshit opposition to the black lives matter protest

550
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
Why you're protecting

551
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,576
Flagrant racism

552
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
Hey

553
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,512
Don't talk go ahead and do that cuz that's it's too it's too complicated

554
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,816
Finding the things that she was asked about

555
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:36,960
For two years while Wikipedia that so Alex

556
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
He doesn't like the news anymore

557
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,064
Philosophy

558
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Gaston

559
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
Scott Moore

560
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Christian

561
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,744
GameStop Christiansburg

562
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
The world

563
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
Self-help

564
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,448
Asparagus

565
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
Resume

566
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,008
Dim manipulate other people

567
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Running inside

568
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
He's on the stand

569
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Yep

570
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,152
This is rambly

571
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
I mean look

572
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Hand

573
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,344
I guess he's just saying what you kind of could tell if you watch his show

574
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,416
Kind of pivoting into something

575
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,256
That is less grounded in reality televangelist

576
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,656
You don't have to pretend you have proof for

577
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:48,544
You can lie about the Bible all day and people really don't care

578
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
Sure I think that getting into philosophy in the big picture is of generous way to say yelling about the devil

579
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Yeah I think I think this is true Alex has given up the pretense calves being about news and documents

580
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Then all this

581
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:07,487
Because it never was real to begin with exactly what's interesting about that is

582
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
That

583
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:14,399
This is something that I noticed throughout Alex's testimony is that Alex was clearly the best coach

584
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,519
Because I really don't even know if Dari are Owen we're given instructions on what questions

585
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,823
Reynald was going to ask bright right

586
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,687
But right now is clearly giving Alex prompts for these answers that they had talked about

587
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:31,807
Because they don't look as terrible as the real ones do right yeah and then Alex

588
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,599
Just can't not be Alec

589
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,463
So he gives his gives his prepared remarks and then you can see him kind of scramble

590
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,863
And then start rambling off and on all the sudden he's like and so that's why the Democrats are in here like

591
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,447
Yeah but that's like what

592
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,823
To get out on the sand

593
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,919
So part of the reason he can't stop himself is cuz he he's just

594
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Over-prepared

595
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
How many hours a day

596
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
I'm only year

597
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Southport hours today

598
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
And

599
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
Been on the air

600
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,191
1997

601
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Navigate

602
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
In order to prepare

603
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
4 hours

604
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Well let me ask you this

605
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
How many days are we

606
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
So in order to

607
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Prepare for 4 hours

608
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
How many hours

609
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Her debut

610
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
Marshmallow

611
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
Research

612
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:55,007
That was a far cry from the 16 hours a day you're studying the global is really did seem like he was over play

613
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:00,895
Playing his hand and now it seems like he's down play good huh see it seems like on air

614
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
I do literally nothing globalist white papers and documents write all of them

615
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695
Their dirty laundry Sabrina Diaz that are filthy

616
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Reading these documents exactly

617
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:22,143
Audio about 2 hours of the morning have you two hours a night busy

618
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:28,799
I really don't even know like I really don't even know what this is he also being

619
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
Used for because here's why I can explain

620
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:37,247
What he says on his show would be laughable the jury would never believe

621
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
It would be something like

622
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:44,415
Yeah right what are you doing for 16 hours

623
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,999
But the two 24-hours is believable

624
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
Right that is a believable amount of Transportation 24 hours of a show you do an 8-hour workday

625
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,287
You would expect for somebody who's doing a job more or less

626
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
And it's you don't want him to look like I just shoot-from-the-hip entirely

627
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,295
Cuz then there's an approach that is it's structurally irresponsible

628
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,879
I do like what ended up happening

629
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,719
But the same time you don't want to make it look like he does nothing but do the show cuz

630
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:23,327
First of all don't believe of all second of all if so then you should have vetted Wolfgang halbig

631
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
You would think

632
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
If you're working today I had to take out the time I mean I meant more for like the defense's case

633
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,847
It's because part of what they're arguing is clearly Alex spend so much time

634
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
On are you know

635
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:43,039
You smell like 5 minutes telling these people you know all of this stuff that kind of thing was 1/10 of 14

636
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
Percent right right right

637
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,135
But it could also be that look

638
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
He works so hard

639
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
These things are going to fall through the cracks you know he says 95% of my time as I'm not doing anything like this that kind of

640
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,119
But either way

641
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
The problem is

642
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,471
He's already been found guilty of doing the thing sure

643
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:05,567
So we can't really reduce the damages can it or is it just like

644
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,615
See he's a down-home country guy

645
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:14,015
I think that's a large part of humanizing him

646
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:20,415
A small a propaganda Outlet

647
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,231
News at this point is

648
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,863
You know a limited amount of employees that he has and perception is is kind of

649
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Making it

650
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,471
More normal right as opposed to the absurdity that is

651
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,079
I meant continues even into this next clip which actually just made me really really sad

652
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
When did you start

653
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
King on other hosts

654
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
2000

655
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
Alex knows damn well that the Nightly News started in 2011 but that would make his operation to look much more professional if he worth

656
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Be aware of that so

657
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
Pretty important that it started well after the. Of Sandy Hook

658
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
Even worse is that Alex has completely forgotten about his original companion show the info Warrior featuring Jason bermas

659
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
2009 H4 Infowars in those early days

660
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Madera

661
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
This Omission is insulting

662
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
I poked you and said

663
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
Forgot about Burma you sure did

664
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:39,775
No it definitely not and I was his best interest

665
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,591
Producing other shows on Infowars at this point in his career

666
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,991
Like I said is a mom-and-pop propaganda Outlet possibly

667
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,599
Boogeyman that led to so much pain he wasn't the CEO of what

668
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
Maybe what Owen would have to eventually describe as a mainstream media TV studio

669
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,791
I mean it goes all directions

670
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
We're small thing. No other shows

671
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,775
I put in an honest 925 day at work but then of course there was actually another question about like the war

672
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:18,175
Working on admin stuff

673
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Let's park

674
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
A little bit about

675
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Where you get

676
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
When's the last

677
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
Sorry what

678
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,327
Operation

679
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
2000 +

680
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,391
I guess I was just forgetting about his decades-long business relationship with Midas resources

681
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:37,791
These couple of attempts to Branch out into selling his audience to a multi-level marketing scams and was fun

682
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:44,191
Bunch of money from Mike Lindell and My Pillow pretty recently she wear and his affiliate links with my Patriot Supply

683
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:49,823
Respectable sponsors like a car company but it's pretty important to pretend

684
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Outside no institutional support around the time of Sandy Hook

685
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,551
So much for having his principles

686
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,135
This is why you have to tell people you took one

687
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
And you go with diamond gusset

688
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,743
Sure you say we took one sponsor

689
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
And they couldn't even get anybody's jeans right

690
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
Diamond gusset jeans and then we were done

691
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
Self-funded from there on out

692
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:20,543
I think it would be really difficult to pretend that diamond gusset decided not to sponsor Alex's show

693
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Because he was against Obama

694
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,223
Yeah that would might be tough commercial I do like his bulshit on this

695
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:36,671
Like a thing that people would believe him ye hide your gun

696
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,743
You want to be involved

697
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Jerk

698
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Anyway

699
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
Alex decides

700
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,983
Maybe a good idea would be to try and red pills a jury

701
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
Couple of in here we go

702
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
We'll take that clip earlier today they are

703
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
What

704
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,727
You'll feed all the bulshit man moment where I was like holy

705
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:28,127
Please share this can't be allowed to stand was like he was trying to

706
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
To argue that

707
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:30,175
Like

708
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:36,831
You and I both know what this is really about to the jury like he's saying to Jerry like Hey listen

709
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:43,487
I know you know that all this Glitz and cord is nonsense watch the Clips in that hole

710
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,559
You'll see that I'm right

711
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,959
You're going to be one of us at the end of this trial believe that

712
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:58,591
Trial by fire in The Crucible you have accidentally annoyed

713
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:04,991
No boy another moment that I found particularly distasteful is when he started talking about his product

714
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Do you sell

715
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Yes

716
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Are your B

717
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Why not

718
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,887
The ones

719
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
Whole Foods G

720
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
Ready.

721
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Equality

722
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
Because

723
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,159
I'll give it to Whole Foods

724
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
They got molly Pirates

725
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:51,071
There's all sorts of crap

726
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
That's not what I

727
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:05,919
Underoath I'd like to tell you about the 4th of July special

728
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:11,295
Mad that I wasn't allowed to laugh the moment he was like

729
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
We buy our pqq from the Japanese like Wholey's like everybody in the courtroom was going to blow up

730
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,655
Everyone everyone knows that the Japanese do not sell their pqq to just anybody

731
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:33,055
Yeah delivered it to

732
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
You like holyshit I'm going to blow their mind

733
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,455
Yeah God damn what a what an insane person

734
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
Yeah yeah that's a

735
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Really threw me for a loop

736
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
To prompt him

737
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
To sell

738
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:56,863
Well no I don't think so I don't think I'll be in Alex's head I would imagine it rain all

739
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,703
That the setup of the question was to facilitate the

740
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:07,103
Exploring Alex's Revenue sources it is much as he sells vitamins and people look down on

741
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,503
Live because of it but they're actually good that is the thrust of the question in the attorneys

742
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
He's mine

743
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:19,647
Not that Alex is going to talk about getting pqq from Tampa this is where I feel like

744
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:25,535
Trying to apply the rules of normal logic to what's going on is because it's clear

745
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,839
That right now thinks something is true

746
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:34,239
And Alex think something is true and it's supposed to be on the same team it is not the same thing I think that's

747
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,639
Probably a fair assessment

748
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:44,735
I get it I get it yeah so here Alex

749
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
How much

750
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Email

751
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Does

752
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
Infowars

753
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Discovery

754
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,983
It was still in the box unopened

755
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,055
Billion Auto

756
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:15,455
So Alex is said that he complied with discovery which is going to be a problem later immediately later

757
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Because he said something else

758
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
How many

759
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,039
Infowars

760
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Email everyday

761
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Going back

762
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
There's a

763
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
True Circle

764
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
What does

765
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:12,799
Alright

766
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
We're going to

767
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,223
We're going to take a break

768
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,623
So Mark has stood up and said that we need to make a contemporaneous motion

769
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:33,023
That's because Alex cannot say that he or his company are bankrupt in this part of the trial that they're in at this

770
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Stage

771
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:40,447
Claimed he could make in the portion about net worth which is separated from the compensatory damages phase of the proceedings

772
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:44,287
But it also probably be inappropriate at that point since it's not true

773
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
This is why Mark asked to make

774
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Steve these motions

775
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:54,271
Alex has now said that he's bankrupt and that he complied with Discovery in front of the jury which are both deeply and

776
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
Appropriate things for him to do

777
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:01,951
Can't do it he raises this concern Mark does leads to judge Campbell dismissing the jury and then saying

778
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
This

779
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Watching party

780
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Just stop

781
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,687
Yep

782
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
He is

783
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
Confused

784
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
Flummoxed

785
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,719
Something that was pretty cathartic for a lot of folks

786
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
You've already

787
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
Stop

788
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
You must

789
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,743
You're sure

790
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Further

791
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
No estas

792
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
Comments about

793
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Understand

794
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Everything you say

795
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,351
Just because

796
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
Protect you

797
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
That means

798
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
You say that

799
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
You understand

800
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
I have been

801
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
They don't talk there is

802
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
Yeah I believe what I said was true and the response

803
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
That is

804
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
The Crux

805
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,607
Of why debate with someone like Alex's one

806
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:27,007
Step there is a complete disconnect from any objectivity

807
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
Any any belief

808
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,127
In a reality that exists outside of what you want to be true

809
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
And

810
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,223
That is hard and a courtroom setting

811
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:42,623
Yeah I mean you know we've we've said before they like any communication begins with the definition of terms kind of feeling

812
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,463
But that cannot be possible if somebody is speaking bird

813
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,999
Well you're trying to speak English

814
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:53,375
You can't be like oh okay cheap cheap means now it's just not going to happen

815
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
You can't do it and so I can like talk to birds as it is satisfying to hear somebody have to be like

816
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Listen

817
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,871
Objective reality is real I don't know how to

818
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Like she's

819
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:11,039
Flabbergasted by the idea that that might be introduced into court I have to introduce to you better

820
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
Concepts of

821
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
Object

822
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,743
What is the abysa desk tell me what is and is not for you so we can continue

823
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:26,399
You back later I think that I was I was subject

824
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,727
The notion of

825
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:36,383
Alex being under oath in those first the first deposition that came out excited

826
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,783
But like the idea that Alex is finally going to not be able to lie lie right and I myself

827
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
Was intrigued by the possibility with the trial as a

828
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,999
Preceded I was not

829
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,095
Expecting the same things that a lot of people might have out of this trial

830
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
And I feel for it the judge

831
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:04,287
Preside over this is a impossible task

832
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
And

833
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,359
Notion

834
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,431
I think a lot of people are entering this with other perception

835
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:15,295
Is that this trial is it doesn't exist in the context of the case

836
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
That preceded it

837
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:21,695
You know like you see her being kind of annoyed and it's because Alex has pulled this s***

838
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
Over and over and over and over again

839
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,839
No I think it in one interview that I did I can't remember

840
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,655
Who was with it but I made a point that like

841
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,471
She looks like she's pissed off

842
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:38,847
But she's being so patient of this is missing

843
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:45,247
If you only watch the trial coming away from it with the perception that like

844
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:51,391
I do not giving Alex an inch but there's a reason and that's that's unfortunate

845
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:57,023
Yeah there's not a previously off before the trial or whatever it is

846
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,327
She is doing such a great job

847
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Because she is giving

848
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,191
So much preferential treatment to the defense

849
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:10,079
Like an event and let me try and explain that better job like you right right right so

850
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,639
If Alex was a normal person

851
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:17,503
The fourth time you tell them they can't lie on the stand

852
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
There has to be some consequences

853
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,951
Get that far so we don't even know

854
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,743
How to deal with this

855
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,559
Because you eat you if you do that

856
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
That's what he wants he wants you to say

857
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:39,007
Oh I have to go to jail for lying there locking me up for telling the truth right you know that's what

858
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:46,175
Hey Alex you put a sticker on your mouth for real

859
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,575
Constant push and pull between her being like I have to treat you like a screaming whiny baby and at the same time I have to

860
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
To treat this like we're in an actual Court

861
01:03:54,623 --> 01:04:00,767
Do you have to be treated like a screaming whiny baby because that's what your behavior is at the same time

862
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Treated like an adult

863
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,375
Because you're facing adults consequences for your adult actions

864
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,679
I am yeah it's a it's a

865
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:14,079
It's a difficult position. I'm not jealous of that there's a lot that you wouldn't have ever allowed the plaintiff

866
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,895
Just to get away with locally simply because she's like

867
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:23,295
You're a dolt I have to hold you to a standard that I'm not holding these fourth graders to and that she did

868
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:29,695
Give them that preferential treatment is both like starkly unfair and yet at the same time the only way to have this trial

869
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
To be totally fair

870
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:36,863
I don't know if it's appropriate to call a preferential treatment

871
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,679
Gave a lot of patience

872
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
A lot of wide berth

873
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
Are all right I'm not going to

874
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Hold you in contempt

875
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:54,271
For clearly lying under oath for doing the thing that we hold people in contempt there was a lot

876
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,343
A generous approach to

877
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,439
The punishing Alex and he still couldn't operate within that space

878
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:08,095
So we go to the second Bay now cuz the this is where the took the break for the days when

879
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
5

880
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,679
And so Alex returns Underoath

881
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,007
And there's still the direct questioning retinol is still

882
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,079
Giving him questions and unfortunately

883
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:24,479
The Lime Crime video of this is missing the first 10 minutes or so

884
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
The beginning of this is establishing that Alex kind of like had less connection with those weirdos

885
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:37,279
Close then maybe he actually did

886
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,583
Werewolf game

887
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,935
On the bus pretty hard

888
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
Reached a comment

889
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,591
Which is subject first week of the trial

890
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:57,503
Steve pieczenik was one of the names that rain all brought up to Becca being like

891
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,391
Whenever he was on his array of this person's racist do you think this first of the races do you think that

892
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:10,047
Stevi B's name come up as as like a defendable name along with Stefan molyneux

893
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,191
Stefan molyneux racist

894
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
Yabby the beginning portion of this is really trying to downplay the connection right in Alex's associations with

895
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,551
The major players

896
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,367
And some of them I think they're kind of like

897
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:39,999
You could you could actually get away with this like I don't think him and James Tracy had that much

898
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,815
Connection end

899
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:49,471
I think Alex should be hanging his hat far more on the fact that Paul Joseph Watson interview with James Tracey the initial one

900
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Was

901
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
Like

902
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,567
A little bit adversarial

903
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:58,431
Maybe not as much as a like of actual responsible journalists would check

904
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:05,087
Call didn't push back on the idea that there were acting grades on a curve for the

905
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
Fifth graders Paul

906
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
Has proven himself to be in 7

907
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
Centigrade

908
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:16,095
So Steve has come up here and Alex has it interesting perception on what he did

909
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,191
During that time you interviewed Steve pieczenik

910
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,751
About the story

911
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,335
Did you reach out to reach out to you how did that

912
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,383
Video

913
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
Other subjects to leave came up or

914
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
This isn't really accurate

915
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,095
Alex didn't argue with Steve but it also wouldn't

916
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:53,471
You'll be a mischaracterization to say that he gave Steve a full backing his client

917
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:58,079
Alex was interested in the theories I'm just like we got top experts saying it's fake

918
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,151
He didn't really commit to it in that interview

919
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
For something else

920
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:09,599
He was pretending to be Alex's on-the-scene reporter in the demilitarized zone because Alex was trying to drum up Annika Bettendorf

921
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:14,719
Carrillo's going to start a nuclear war god I remember that said he was in Korea

922
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:21,631
He said he was inside hanging out with soldiers from both side Hunter

923
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Korea

924
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Yep yep

925
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,215
From Florida he claimed that

926
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:31,615
I have no evidence that there is a really decent

927
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:38,015
He was on a vacation to South Korea because I have seen some pictures on he posted

928
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
Sorry I missed welcome.

929
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:50,815
DMT

930
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
So we're in this course of questioning I think that Alex the goal that he had was to present this

931
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
Image that like

932
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:05,407
His life was really in trouble around the time he hook happen

933
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,455
Can you tell us what

934
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,039
Glad you two have Wolfgang halbig on in 24

935
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
River bullet points

936
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Leprechaun

937
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
What is anything else

938
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
What's going on in your

939
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
My family is falling apart

940
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,199
Weird like attempt to paint a picture of like

941
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,599
If your if you weren't divorced you wouldn't have booked Wolfgang halbig yeah that's weird

942
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
This guy.

943
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
Weird

944
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,207
Yeah this whole section where he's

945
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
His whole woe-is-me thing

946
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
Was

947
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,935
I mean I know that they wanted it to come off as though he was like a person who was also suffering

948
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,239
But it really just came off more like

949
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
Are you going to do this

950
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:14,527
And also tries to blame Steve more which I if I receive I would not appreciate I would probably attack our

951
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
What's mangos

952
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,135
You're crazy old man and you got nothing to lose

953
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,671
We've had

954
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,695
A video of

955
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
Received

956
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
Of you stating

957
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,071
Your belief

958
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
At that time

959
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
No one died

960
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
Set the whole thing

961
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
Do you understand if you sit here today

962
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
How crazy running

963
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
No said before

964
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:45,759
The past than I was under a lot of pressure

965
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,063
And I truly want to share those

966
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
Play Say Something

967
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:54,975
Tupperware my wife is divorcing

968
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,023
And I was basing that off of

969
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
Absolutely response

970
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,079
Especially since I've been to Paris

971
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
Harbor Central

972
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Somerset real

973
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
They won't let me

974
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
In the position of being

975
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
Directions

976
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
Private Steve needs to get on YouTube and cut a video

977
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
About Alex under the bus

978
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:58,719
The Sandy Hook man come on

979
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,279
Great for both of them

980
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:07,679
But mostly for make who's David Knight going to side with

981
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
Dudes against Alex

982
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Okay

983
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:16,127
Old dudes against Alex's young guards I would like to see

984
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:22,527
David Knight and Steve pieczenik reach day talk at you like

985
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:27,135
But some desire to Spill the tea on Alex

986
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
For a lot of final team up of Grumpy Old Men 3 is this the first time that

987
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,375
They talked and spill the tea ever do stupid things

988
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
I don't know the French had a lot of things to say

989
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:50,687
Accurate now that we're going off the rails

990
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,527
So I Alex says something about his

991
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,391
Realization that Sandy Hook was real in this next clip and I found this deeply troubling

992
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
At the end or the middle of 2015

993
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
July 20th

994
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
You stop

995
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,399
Infowars stop cover

996
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Why did you

997
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
Because

998
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:24,991
How big was saying that I was involved in Sandy Hook because I wouldn't have them on and I started finding out that stuff

999
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,623
I just get it

1000
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Stop

1001
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
For a while

1002
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Probably

1003
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,199
Not everything. Everything stays

1004
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,855
So this is disturbing because there does seem to be a pattern of Alex discussing his drinking as it relates to his actions involve

1005
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:02,879
Calling Sandy Hook

1006
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:09,279
We've seen it in interview and now under oath and honestly it's indicative of a very serious substance-abuse problem

1007
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:16,191
Drunk or sober Alex's an a****** and deserves the consequences of his actions but I want to draw sharp Focus to the difference in

1008
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:25,919
Kirin Court Alex's discussing his realization that Sandy Hook actually happened about sometime in

1009
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,943
2015

1010
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
There's absolutely no problem for him to bring up that he'd stop drinking for a while as an explanation for his supposed.

1011
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:37,439
Clarity but he does which leads me to believe that it means something to him

1012
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
I don't think that it's true but I do believe that he probably was going through a lot and stop drinking for a while around the edges

1013
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
2015

1014
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,471
This is all being Sudden Service of humanizing Alex in minimizing the things that he did

1015
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:55,615
He's going through a lot and drinking a ton But realize that he was wrong and changed his behavior

1016
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
Accepting reality he didn't

1017
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,807
He was still doing a show Wasted Years past this point and he didn't change his behavior in any meaningful way

1018
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:08,671
He's still just ran with b******* stories from bolted sources and defame people regularly

1019
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,327
But he wants the perception to be that this was just a bad pocket in his life when all these negative influences let him to drink

1020
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,607
His judgment was weekend

1021
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:23,263
He doesn't want the jury to know that he got right back to the heavy drinking and bullshiting with Steve pieczenik basically the next week

1022
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,615
Because that kind of cheap and whatever fake display of penitence he's trying to put on here

1023
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:32,479
But the other time Alex discussed his drinking a relation to Sandy Hook was a lot different

1024
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:39,135
In the Glenn Greenwald Q&A Alex was joking about how he defamed grieving parents and caused immeasurable pain in their lives by

1025
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,719
I think that he didn't know what he was doing and drank a bottle of vodka that day

1026
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
It wasn't a person expressing this is a negative thing it was Alex trying to appear cool because he wanted to impress the

1027
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,447
Cool kids like Greenwald who can give her access to a new audience

1028
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,263
I find this Dynamic deeply upsetting

1029
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:00,639
And the only conclusion I can come to is that Alex was drinking on are all lot during this stretch

1030
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,223
Everybody probably has a way bigger problem than even I think

1031
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,599
And I have been chastised for begging people in his life to get him help a bunch in the past true

1032
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:13,183
Anyway a lot of This falls on deaf ears to me in a courtroom setting

1033
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,815
Like I would take him more seriously if you took the time that he did in the q-and-a while on the stand but that's not going to happen

1034
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:25,471
Cuz there's no cool kids to impress their like

1035
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,775
We like all right

1036
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,871
I'm here interested

1037
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:34,431
How do you say that in the in a courtroom

1038
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,271
How do you do that because to me what you just said is

1039
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:42,367
Nah come on it wasn't that bad whenever I hit him I was drunk driving

1040
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,183
Like I don't know how you say that in the courtroom

1041
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
In-N-Out

1042
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,911
Situation that is ostensibly you also saying that you believe it's 100% rude you were only driving because you

1043
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,215
Decorated ugly divorce

1044
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:02,335
But even then you're saying that you're saying that you said that when you were drunk

1045
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,407
And now you're saying that it's a hundred percent real

1046
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,991
Are you drunk or are you sober and does it matter

1047
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:15,647
I mean if that's why you're ravets your reasoning here then it doesn't matter you know when they when they were boarded it yours never was

1048
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,975
A hundred percent truth there's a part of me that's like well was he drunk

1049
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
Because

1050
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,095
Finn would amuse the same amount either way

1051
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,495
Write a man it's just it's just stay away for him to contextualize his actions by looking at his pass

1052
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
Past self as

1053
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,615
The drunk self that's not me that's a different

1054
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:42,015
That can be definitely true for people who get help like I'm not saying that you know who you are when you're

1055
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:48,415
In your addiction is necessarily who you have to put the rest of your life recovery is possible and all that

1056
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,719
Right but I was not done any of that stuff

1057
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:57,375
Answer him trying to pretend like this past self is somebody that I owned up to being and it but it is not

1058
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,727
A characteristic of perception

1059
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:08,127
Of people's understanding of Mike Tyson

1060
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,151
Trucking show

1061
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,967
A month ago I mean part of

1062
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Listen

1063
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,623
You do have to own up to consequences for your behavior regardless of

1064
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:25,023
Whether you are an addict or not part of recovering out that's part of what it is and he's not even owning up

1065
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
2 is behavior

1066
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
In courtroom

1067
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:34,495
Because all this is in genuine and just an attempt to feel less bad about himself

1068
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:39,359
This whole situation is not about the parents for him it is entirely about him

1069
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:43,967
Trying to feel good about himself rationalization

1070
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,039
So the Kraken comes up adande

1071
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,111
Alex definitely does not want to be associated with him

1072
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,951
During that time there was a reporter working

1073
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
There's a gentleman who at least

1074
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,071
We got yeah you should have said reporter remember

1075
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
At some point

1076
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
Infowars

1077
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,679
Danza donde are you familiar with that

1078
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
Can you tell us who he is

1079
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,799
He was a part-time reporter

1080
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:12,383
We're supposed to say that

1081
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:21,087
So Rob's like this guy's like Howard Stern

1082
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,183
Funny stuff

1083
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
All babies like your Wack Pack

1084
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:33,375
The comedy the damn batondy was doing writings like going to that for you hearing without

1085
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,399
Hilarious

1086
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:40,799
Hilarious hilarious interrupted the Boston bombing

1087
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:47,199
Be at the press conference does Arnett brothers were still on the loose and unidentified

1088
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,599
At least you didn't say that he was specifically harassing people that he said he was being a hilarious jokes to write

1089
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
I mean

1090
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,415
Look this is such b*******

1091
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,767
For every reason

1092
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:07,167
He didn't approve of this dive like go back and listen to those Boston bombing episodes

1093
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
Over the moon and just like

1094
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,640
It's celebrating dhanbad on deed interrupting this press conference of yelling infowars.com yep

1095
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,944
Yeah you prove all of it

1096
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
You're making a joke of serious things

1097
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:23,040
You were doing with him

1098
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
And

1099
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,368
You just don't want to own up to the pain I caused

1100
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:32,512
So this whole defense is largely circled around the idea that you have to watch the full clips

1101
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:37,376
This point reynal puts on a very long video

1102
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:43,520
Nothing better a problem here but also

1103
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,568
The video includes Alex

1104
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
Repeat and yep the claim yep that Wolfgang halbig correct

1105
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,112
Why did the school have no traffic offline

1106
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:00,416
Yeah I know all this isn't true

1107
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:05,792
Yeah it was wild for them to insist on playing the full clip the full clip of which

1108
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,096
Was more damning than the shorter clip

1109
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,376
Yeah I would argue

1110
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
Outside of the

1111
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:18,336
Just a repetition of Wolfgang's point and the conspiracies around Sandy Hook

1112
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,408
I don't help their case

1113
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,504
There were some other things that I thought would be interesting to point out you're the first one

1114
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,336
Yeah it's back then molyneux was

1115
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:56,736
Define nationalism

1116
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,784
Molyneux Paul Joseph Watson

1117
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
You know you had had a real difference

1118
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:07,232
The climate in the time that I'll explain his video all those players are so different

1119
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
I mean they didn't have to snub mama do because he spoke a little bit too openly

1120
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:26,432
I get to be coming back did you ever see that video of Owen Benjamin after the intellectual dark web

1121
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Started not liking him

1122
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
There's a video of him drinking beer and complaining about all the like intellectual dark web people who don't like him anymore cuz he

1123
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,696
It's just the same thing

1124
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,488
I understand that

1125
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Like yes

1126
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:46,912
You should be pissed off right your friends who don't like you anymore because you spoke to openly but I things that you all believe

1127
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:50,496
You all believe the same s*** absolutely you just said

1128
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,104
Some slurs

1129
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,920
I feel like Stefan molyneux should definitely feel that way

1130
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
Like

1131
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:04,064
The concept that he was putting out when everybody was buddy-buddy with him is just as offensive

1132
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
As the stuff

1133
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:11,488
Betty puts out later later

1134
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Describe the feeling

1135
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
That they must have is like

1136
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,096
They're all over the line

1137
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:20,960
Like these are all people who are Wylie Coyote who have already jumped off the edge of the cliff

1138
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:24,800
And you if you say the slur that's who like you telling everybody else

1139
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,872
Oh look we're floating and then you fall in there like

1140
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:34,272
Good thing we're not floating we're so we're just standing on Solid Ground I was never running with that guy

1141
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:45,792
In this clip that they're playing in court this coverage of him that is actually pretty good

1142
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,608
You either sell one person

1143
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
Who's done a great job

1144
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,704
Zerohedge

1145
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:20,096
Turn on flashlight

1146
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:35,200
0. Maui is the person who wrote the article that Owen was relying on when he defamed

1147
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,480
Pastelon

1148
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,808
So A Towing is 0.9 puppet

1149
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:45,696
Yeah yeah

1150
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:51,072
To see this pop up here

1151
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:56,960
Because this is also in a very close timeframe with when Owen made that video

1152
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:02,592
Talking about how he doesn't want the Megyn Kelly interview to air after he shot it

1153
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,896
But before it airs

1154
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:08,224
It's in that pocket and then Owen Chu said video pretty-much

1155
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,808
Closely after the Megyn Kelly interview airs

1156
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,112
As a response to it so

1157
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
What you have here is to hire the person who wrote the article that Owen relied on

1158
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,864
How to create defamatory content

1159
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,192
Yeah it is it is amazing to me that

1160
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
1

1161
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
The defense

1162
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,544
Only used the plaintiffs evidence

1163
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,384
Which is usually about sign to

1164
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,688
That's in so doing

1165
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,016
They have made the plaintiff's case really really well

1166
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,552
I would think so

1167
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
So rental

1168
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Comes back

1169
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:51,744
And he wants to have Alex say that Sandy Hook is real and not a conspiracy

1170
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,536
Here's the first attempt here we go

1171
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,816
As you sit here today

1172
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,912
What are your

1173
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,728
Police

1174
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
Around

1175
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
That's an apology right

1176
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,368
Because

1177
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,952
I'm sorry wait are you questioning Sandy Hook in the sand

1178
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
But surely died

1179
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:44,992
Florida

1180
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:58,048
Rambles gets caught off into talking about Uvalde doubt there's a

1181
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:04,448
Patches onto the idea of a cover-up to defend his cover-up idea so he jumps to Uvalde

1182
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,544
Get that gets an objection so now here's the second attempt go for it again

1183
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,336
My question was

1184
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
As you studio today

1185
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,920
What is your

1186
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,224
Your position your view

1187
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,784
What happened

1188
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,320
The murders

1189
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Sandy Hook Elementary

1190
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,624
2000

1191
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,488
Young man on

1192
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,768
Psychotropic drugs

1193
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:39,520
I think we're coming really close to can just hear

1194
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:46,176
So Alex now says his Pharmaceuticals and feels the need to defend the pharmaceutical stock

1195
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:53,344
I am so he goes down that road hits another objection at

1196
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,744
He said I'm going to move on and then Alex of his own volition decides to try a third time

1197
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,536
Anywhere sitting here we go

1198
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
From mileo psychopath

1199
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:20,224
Zaxby's

1200
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,648
Right now there's actually no question

1201
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Question

1202
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,792
Answer to the question asked

1203
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,472
Yes I only said three tries there to say something

1204
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:47,872
Yep very simple could not help himself from creating conspiracy

1205
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:52,224
Barnes

1206
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,552
In my entire life that I never hear mark

1207
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:02,208
Say something with the amount of smile at 11 I don't ever want to hear that that's a bad sound

1208
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:08,608
Glow stick until it that's how bad sound that makes me feel like something dangerous around the corner

1209
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
Like I said Bruno is one last question

1210
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:14,496
They were going to look at and it's a doozy

1211
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,056
When you look back on your

1212
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,128
Twenty-plus years

1213
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
In the media

1214
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,456
What are you most

1215
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,576
Sprouts

1216
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:33,440
911

1217
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Close

1218
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,168
Spell Shepherd

1219
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,472
World record versus was that

1220
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:57,504
Definitely wasn't the first report on wmds in Iraq in the questionable intelligence surrounding the story

1221
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:04,160
Even though he was correct to be skeptical of that story his skepticism was childish it was just a knee-jerk response

1222
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:10,816
It wasn't based on anything other than his own William so I guess he can brag that he got that one but he can't really take any car

1223
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:14,144
But if we're doing any work on the subject or even covering it competently

1224
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:20,800
As we've seen his Iraq war coverage in 2003 is embarrassing stuff from the insistence that the bath party

1225
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:27,200
We're being reinstalled to rule the country while do pacification was taking played unsupported weeks long as

1226
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:33,600
Assertion that saddam's kids were killed and wore in Belarus with their father they still are

1227
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,880
David Kelly suicide

1228
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:39,744
The larger picture that you get from that time as a person is not really worth accepting as a source

1229
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:40,768
It's not worth it

1230
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:47,424
He wasn't the only person saying that wmd intelligence was sketchy and the other people who were expressing that opinion didn't

1231
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,520
Overwhelmed that accurate opinion with an avalanche of embarrassing bulshit

1232
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
As for Epstein

1233
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,128
I really want to challenge this because I don't believe this at all

1234
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,784
I listen to Alex from a lot of periods of his career and I've never heard him bring up everything except after larger media covered

1235
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,552
The story

1236
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:09,696
I don't believe it all but Alex was covering Epstein let alone covering a by name 10 years before the mainstream

1237
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,792
I believe that Alex has convinced himself of his own b*******

1238
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:20,192
Like we talked about earlier cuz I can find Alex basically believe the satanic panic

1239
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,216
Stuff was real

1240
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,872
Things like the McMartin School case we're actually real any based a lot of that all that and same s*** detect

1241
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,408
Gunderson apparently had told him

1242
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,552
I do accept that Alex has talked about his fantasies of satanic groups kidnapping and abusing children for a long time

1243
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:39,648
And I think what he's done is retroactively connect Epstein to that cover

1244
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,696
So you can claim he's on the story all along

1245
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,512
Like how his first documentary was about the great reset

1246
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:50,912
Right I'm open to anyone providing me with evidence that Alex was talking about Epstein by name about his island in the sex

1247
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:55,776
Crime 10 years before everyone else and if they do I will re-evaluate my position

1248
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:00,384
But I've looked and I can find no evidence that this claim that Alex is making his true at all

1249
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:07,296
I didn't look through the Alex Jones prediction section on his website where you post all the videos of him ostensibly being right

1250
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,600
Write about all these things way back in the past

1251
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:12,928
I can't find any video of him being way ahead of the curve on Epstein

1252
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Advice

1253
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,256
This answer Alex has given

1254
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
Feels accurate

1255
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:23,936
He's asked to say what he's most proud of in his career and what he comes up with his one story that half the country got right and the other

1256
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Thirtysomething

1257
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,496
Is almost certainly not true

1258
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
There's nothing in his career to be proud of

1259
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:35,712
He spouted meeting was bulshit for two decades and I'll definitely applaud him for dragging it out that long but beyond

1260
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,784
His career has meant nothing but other people's pain

1261
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
And profiting from it

1262
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:45,696
Yeah yeah I thought was if that was me I wouldn't I would have said nothing I've been like

1263
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,768
You know what I really want to answer this question

1264
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,584
We've lost so many megastars like

1265
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:57,984
Reset Wars oh no that's not good what else do we got

1266
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,520
I made a lot of money

1267
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
Jakari Jackson

1268
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:04,640
Published a children's book I think that was pretty cool that was after

1269
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:10,528
Cross-examination start autoboy this is fun

1270
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,088
A little bit down the road yeah but the first

1271
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:18,464
Mark's initial strategy in the beginning of this is to impeach Alex as a credible Witness

1272
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,024
And so to do that he sets a couple traps

1273
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,328
I talked to you about the details

1274
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,632
The history of Escape

1275
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,424
I want to know

1276
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,984
Taking the straw seriously

1277
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,264
You're pregnant

1278
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Absolutely

1279
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,152
You and your company

1280
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
12world

1281
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
The Fish Joint

1282
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,368
To make sure that a

1283
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,928
A literal

1284
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
Is being formal

1285
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,024
That's what you want

1286
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,888
Corner Bar

1287
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,288
That works if you answer a question until there's an objection

1288
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,920
Ewing

1289
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,968
You want the world

1290
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
Is reading

1291
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,064
This court

1292
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,160
And I mean a literal

1293
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,464
Is being followed

1294
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,744
That's what you want the world

1295
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:31,168
That food in Fort Worth

1296
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Question

1297
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,200
No I believe the jury is real

1298
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,232
Your honor at this time we'd like to offer a clip from Infowars on Friday for the purposes of peachment and which those exact words was

1299
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
Whoops

1300
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Oops

1301
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:02,656
So that happens and then immediately leads into another trap

1302
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,240
You've been talkin about a lot

1303
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
On yourself

1304
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,128
Is your allegation

1305
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,920
That government official

1306
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,736
Are aiding and pedophilia

1307
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,296
Child trafficking in The Grooming of children

1308
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,976
Yes is that a yes

1309
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,792
On Thursday

1310
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,376
You and Infowars started connecting those allegations

1311
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
No

1312
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:39,008
You're telling the world

1313
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,848
What happens in this courtroom

1314
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
Because the judge

1315
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
Work boots

1316
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,480
Do you say

1317
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
Is involved

1318
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
With pedophilia and child

1319
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
I'm asking you.

1320
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,768
How many

1321
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Not

1322
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
To believe what's happened in this truck

1323
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:04,864
Because

1324
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
Is involved with CPS

1325
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:09,728
Who is working with child traffic

1326
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,800
No that's not what I'm saying

1327
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:17,664
Your honor this time we would like to show clip from the gun show on Thursday where those words are so

1328
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:23,552
A of course why wouldn't there

1329
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,184
We're telling the world

1330
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,792
Inside Travis County

1331
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
The jury song

1332
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,472
Don't know what

1333
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
Planets

1334
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,272
What's going on

1335
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
I would be happy

1336
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,816
We would like to know offer up

1337
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,120
Video from mrs. Jones Show on Fridays

1338
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:15,264
This reminds me so much of the the deposition where it's like

1339
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:21,920
Okay how have you wear on try number three how do you not realize that when he says

1340
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:24,224
Did you say those words

1341
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,016
He's going to play the clip

1342
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,040
Right

1343
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,600
But you know answering yes

1344
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,904
Is a chaotic

1345
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:37,536
Options you have to answer me that you have to answer

1346
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
Yes

1347
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:45,216
It's a show like you have to answer with yes and then something you can't say no because he's just going to go

1348
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,032
Go to the clip option

1349
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:52,640
No matter what you end up with is like okay we've demonstrated that Alex's

1350
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,456
An untrustworthy person

1351
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
This is all bulshit

1352
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,296
It's not a witness that you should take seriously your trust

1353
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:03,392
Right position

1354
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:09,792
So Mark tries to bring up the the video that rain all played and the whole thing about how

1355
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Hey

1356
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,352
You just repeat it all the

1357
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,376
Clams

1358
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,400
About the

1359
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,800
The school's not it being real and you realize that if you do that then you are once again denying Sandy Hook

1360
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,592
Yeah and I think

1361
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:28,480
With this is a this is about 2 minutes and it is a really good capsulation of why it is

1362
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
Useless

1363
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:30,528
To try to get Alex

1364
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,064
Recognize

1365
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
Pointsbet

1366
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
He doesn't want to record

1367
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:34,880
Yep

1368
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,416
Do you remember them talking about

1369
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,328
Whatever

1370
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:56,128
BFDI did not have a Crime Stoppers

1371
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,992
Mr. Jones

1372
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,272
Weaver Deluxe

1373
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
Testimony about

1374
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,600
How about. Wrong

1375
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,608
So you messed that up

1376
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:28,384
Really happen

1377
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,712
You in 2017 we're staying yet

1378
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,832
Yeah just like Megyn Kelly said in your interview

1379
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,624
You want to have it always

1380
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,840
It means that there was website traffic

1381
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
Food Insider

1382
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:01,920
Video you say no EMTs entered the building you remember that

1383
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:13,696
Brooke from your break when your attorney put up a video that you really wanted

1384
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,024
Affair you were being about Sandy Hook

1385
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,072
You said no paramedics

1386
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,728
What do you mean by

1387
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,544
Talking about

1388
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,160
Do they get in the building and they see there's no Bots

1389
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,976
You told me that

1390
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:57,728
This is the next stage of the you have to watch the full clip never going to win because they watch the full

1391
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:01,824
Clip and now it had some stuff that Alex probably didn't realize

1392
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:08,224
Or forgotten was in it didn't want that I am so now these are questions that are coming up we have watch the full clip

1393
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,760
Context

1394
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,808
I need to see the timeline

1395
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:18,208
Or whatever there's always going to be an excuse for why there isn't complete information in front of you

1396
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:22,304
Exculpatory in some way

1397
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:27,168
It's fascinating to me to listen to this into realize like

1398
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,728
This is also confirmation bias

1399
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,776
They watch the clip

1400
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:36,384
And saw what they wanted to see and then we're like we'll obviously

1401
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,664
This is a great clip

1402
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:43,552
It didn't even occur to them that the other stuff inside the clip could also be used to question Alex

1403
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:47,136
I think I think maybe they approached it from

1404
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:51,488
Maybe a perspective that I had when we were going over the Sandy Hook

1405
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
Immediate aftermath

1406
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:59,424
And that is that I had a singular focus on trying to figure out like the actual literal claim

1407
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,824
Name of actors sure so when I was going over the time frame at 2012 and 2013

1408
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:12,224
There was a lie call Alex isn't quite there yet or without yeah we did have that conversation

1409
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,624
The Cason understanding a little bit more about what was going on and

1410
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,208
I am and all that like my perspective has changed

1411
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:28,608
In terms of like oh yeah you said it was a false flag like immediately basically

1412
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,680
Incarnations of what his theories words.

1413
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:38,080
But I when I was approaching it with like the most generous possible approach

1414
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
Reading things

1415
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,176
I might even say something like

1416
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:48,832
Why didn't the paramedics arrived or whatever and not be like okay this is him denying

1417
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:55,232
Probably when looking at the clip

1418
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,048
That might be just part of how

1419
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:02,400
They are oblivious of what is being said to them

1420
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,728
Feel like you just brought up a really really good points

1421
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:08,544
In in the way that you view that is like

1422
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:12,896
When we talk about denying Sandy hooker Alex denying Sandy Hook

1423
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:17,248
I think a lot of people are talking about him saying this didn't happen

1424
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,344
Write what it is is a an amorphous blob

1425
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:26,464
All of what he has to say is denying that Sandy Hook didn't happen Innocents like

1426
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,096
Okay so he's saying I 100% believe it's real but I question the official narrative that is just

1427
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:38,752
Part of the amorphous blob of denying Sandy Hook when he says that what he's really doing is signaling

1428
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:45,152
That he's still denying Sandy Hook on whatever level he can cling to their will not be

1429
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,552
In a resolution where he says it's under it's a hundred percent real if he also says but I don't question the orb

1430
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,112
But I question the official story

1431
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:59,744
Percent real and then rattle of all of Wolfgang halbig

1432
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
Reasons why he believes it's not wish to question

1433
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,216
Then you're saying that you were right to question them

1434
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:15,616
And you were saying that there are questions about Sandy Hook

1435
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,176
Think that first of all what Alex was doing wasn't Quest

1436
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:24,832
Have your falling into the framing there but they're not because I think that it is okay to

1437
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
Question thing

1438
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,880
You know like

1439
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:33,280
If dick what is a journalist doing other than asking the who what where why when how you know

1440
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:39,680
In court that day when he said but I still I questioned the official narrative in court I mean that outside of that

1441
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:46,080
That you know like

1442
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:52,480
If he saying if he still says I have question

1443
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,040
News about the official opposition

1444
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,808
Exactly

1445
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:05,536
Unspecific.

1446
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,864
Mark is a big a big moment

1447
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:15,008
In the cross-examination courses the revelation of these text messages

1448
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,872
But I think it was a lot of the coverage surrounding this is missing the point

1449
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,408
Of these text messages

1450
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:27,808
Obviously there is the juicy idea of what could be in there for a lot of people are setting themselves up for

1451
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,088
Real disappointment

1452
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:32,416
Like Geraldo found everything in that safe

1453
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:38,816
This isn't based on any kind of like inside information that I have or anything so like don't don't take this as like me being a

1454
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,376
Dino

1455
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:44,192
I see stories about like

1456
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,728
The notion that

1457
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:50,848
Trump's raid was about Alex's text or a blown wide open

1458
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,896
And I think this

1459
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:56,736
There is a there is a desire to

1460
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,528
Expand things in like

1461
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:04,928
Take the what-ifs and and give more Credence to them and I think people are falling into that whether it's their headline right

1462
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:05,952
Fighting or Keats

1463
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:12,352
And I would advise caution just to like a we'll see what happens we'll see what's there

1464
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:18,496
That's right I mean you get that though you hear we have this how can we not say it

1465
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:21,056
Trash of text messages

1466
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:27,712
And and you your main your mind immediately goes to like oh what could be

1467
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,736
Not think to yourself

1468
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,528
It is entirely possible

1469
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,832
Because we live in the weird world we live in

1470
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:38,976
Alex Rodger Trump and Mike Pompeo might have had a group text for the like let's overthrow the country on the six

1471
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:45,376
Like you can't not think in your brain like that kind of ridiculous thing possible the world has gone cuckoo

1472
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:50,752
But then you also have to remember no that is not how it works in these are Alex's text messages

1473
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,032
This is not a big

1474
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,848
Player in the game you know

1475
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:59,712
There may be pieces of information that are relevant to things and

1476
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:02,528
We'll know when we know but for now

1477
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
Don't get ahead of yourself

1478
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,856
Because if you do

1479
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:10,976
You end up cooking yourself or backing yourself into a position where they are like

1480
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,144
You've basically created storyline and if reality doesn't live up to that it's disappointing and I think that I think that

1481
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,704
If we've learned anything in the past

1482
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:27,616
Couple of attempts at impeachment maybe should be a little careful about

1483
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
About setting expectations in a reasonable place

1484
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,344
The reason I started at this I think that the media is absolutely missing the concrete

1485
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,112
Reality

1486
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,672
Of the text messages use

1487
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:41,952
In this case right

1488
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:45,792
Came up in the cross-examination in the way that they did

1489
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:48,608
Enter Mark begins to get into this

1490
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:51,168
And this is really where the pole

1491
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
Text is most import

1492
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:56,032
You remember

1493
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,176
The company has learned from its mistakes

1494
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
Abreva

1495
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,400
Upside down

1496
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,312
And they mention Sandy Hook

1497
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Planet Smoothie

1498
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:32,896
130 + 7

1499
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:39,552
To the lead into this question is Cohen's testimony that they had learned from Sandy Hook and their behaviour had become

1500
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:43,648
And so that's why it's important

1501
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:45,440
How this is revealed

1502
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,232
Mr. Watson

1503
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
Screenshot

1504

Infowars.com

1505

The first

1510
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
Read along with me mr. Jones

1511
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,536
He said

1512
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,096
No problem take your time

1513
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,040
Mr Watson said

1514
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:47,392
Makes us look ridiculous

1515
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,208
Suggesting this means covid is fake

1516
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,744
Sandy Hook

1517
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,024
All over again

1518
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,568
Wichita

1519
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
I get it

1520
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,712
It's true

1521
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,248
That this article

1522
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,296
Right now

1523
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
Why

1524
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,856
Infowars.com

1525
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,000
I guess you guys got balls

1526
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:28,352
So that's a sad response

1527
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:32,448
Cuz Alex is already said that this is his phone either text

1528
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,728
Between Heaven Paul

1529
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:37,824
It's so deep the notion here is the setup

1530
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,848
Of the question

1531
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,688
Is he learned from Sandy Hook you agree with that that's what Owen said

1532
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
Yes

1533
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,736
Here's a text

1534
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,272
During covid

1535
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:50,624
That Paul was telling you this is Sandy Hook all over again with you doing this b*******

1536
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,184
About fake patients

1537
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,024
In hospitals to pretend that there's covid patients at the hospitals

1538
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,816
And you said I get it

1539
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:02,400
Yeah I understand that this is Sandy Hook all over again

1540
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,960
And the article is still alive

1541
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,776
Today as we are in this courtroom

1542
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,312
This is a

1543
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,336
Damning

1544
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:16,224
Picture that is basically do you have not learned

1545
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,016
When reminded

1546
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:20,832
This is Sandy Hook all over again when you're in the middle

1547
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:23,648
Of a lawsuit about this sort of behavior as it relates

1548
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,208
Sandy Hook you say I understand

1549
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,512
I get it right I don't care right

1550
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,792
And not just that

1551
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,840
It is not a message from like

1552
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,376
You know your son

1553
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,424
Or or just

1554
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:40,800
Some stranger email from your literal

1555
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:47,456
Head editor for your most of your career you should pay attention right and the person who

1556
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,272
Who likes throughout the course of this case

1557
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:56,672
Has had maybe the only moments of like someone having Clarity in his death

1558
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,120
This out. This is bulshit

1559
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:11,520
He's he's literally the guy who is like he's a person if you had listened to him you wouldn't be in this situation if we were

1560
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:13,824
In a movie that's different from the one that

1561
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,360
This trial turned into

1562
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,152
Which was this song

1563
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920
But

1564
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:21,760
Paul would be the guy who gets roped back in for one last job

1565
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,296
But in this movie pause like

1566
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:29,952
No this is a terrible one last job I'm not going to do this one last job you guys go do the one that job and then he's watching them

1567
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,024
Like that's what's happening

1568
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,888
Like he sucks obviously into the the lowest of low bars

1569
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
He have cleared it

1570
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,960
In terms of

1571
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:44,032
But he is not stolen 100 million dollars from a bank

1572
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:50,432
Congratulations you are not being prosecuted for stealing $100 million dollars from

1573
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:56,832
You have this situation where Paul is if you listen to him you would be getting sued

1574
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,904
Situation crazy from

1575
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,696
Fairly recently

1576
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,768
If you just you should have listened to him

1577
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,072
And you should not have had this text

1578
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,120
Cuz it illustrates how little you give a s***

1579
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:14,240
And that doesn't play well known I love this here's the movie

1580
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:20,640
Cuz this is the Perry Mason moment the Perry Mason moment while they're amazing moments coming up

1581
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,920
Feeling we have all your texts

1582
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
Right

1583
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,736
The parity is whenever it goes

1584
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:31,392
You're reading it upside down that's where we that's the encapsulation to me of this like moment in testimony

1585
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,928
Funny is that combination of like

1586
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:35,488
Hi drama like I have revealed

1587
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:41,376
F****** Tom Cruise's text messages to you right now and then the f****** hilarity of like

1588
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:46,752
It's upside down Alex out so anyway Alex tries yet

1589
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:49,312
He's trying really hard to figure out like what

1590
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,848
What the f*** can I do here

1591
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,408
You can choke

1592
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:04,928
Here we go

1593
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,024
There's was fun

1594
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
You know how

1595
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,640
What does it mean if the messages are in blue

1596
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:27,968
Whose phone is this

1597
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:39,488
Text robot

1598
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,024
Very bottom left corner

1599
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,072
SEPTA phone number

1600
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
Yes

1601
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Show me

1602
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
Nice trick

1603
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:55,872
So this is the beginning of the Perry Mason mama and this is like

1604
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:58,176
This is what all of the

1605
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:01,760
You know John Oliver show and like all of the clip shows

1606
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,344
They run this moment because it is

1607
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
I mean it's made-for-tv and I mean it's literally made-for-tv. Bill said it's like the biggest

1608
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:16,608
Legal moments

1609
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:23,008
I understand that because of the way our show Works in and I'm so much more interested in

1610
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,056
The reasoning in the context or it's okay

1611
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,872
You have that Paul reveal

1612
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640
And

1613
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:32,736
The reveal of the text messages in the nature of them tabs

1614
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,296
And so that's that's your let's all enjoy that

1615
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Nice trick

1616
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,488
Justin Trudeau

1617
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:48,352
You didn't give this text message to meet and you don't know where this

1618
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
No

1619
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,008
Did you know that

1620
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
12 days ago

1621
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,360
Your attorneys messed up

1622
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:02,432
An entire digital copy

1623
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,480
Of your entire cell phone

1624
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:07,040
With every text message you sent

1625
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:08,576
For the past years

1626
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,856
And winning form

1627
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,928
Did not take any steps to identify it as Privet

1628
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,720
Or protected anyway

1629
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,512
And as of two days ago

1630
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,864
And that is how I know you lied to me

1631
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,656
When you said you didn't have to text message

1632
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,192
Did you know that

1633
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,496
I told you the truth

1634
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:29,824
Did my phone

1635
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,872
Elementary

1636
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,344
In your deposition

1637
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,416
You said

1638
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
You pull down the text

1639
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,720
Inducer

1640
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,256
Sandy Hook

1641
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,024
That's what

1642
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:54,912
Subtle difference

1643
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,080
My lawyer said it to you

1644
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,872
But I'm okay

1645
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:06,176
That's sad

1646
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:09,504
Mr. Jones I love it yeah

1647
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:17,184
Yeah I mean like all of these attempts to wiggle out of this I just feel like have backfired for him and made it worse

1648
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,584
Do you know what the craziest thing the craziest moment cuz whenever I went back through all of the stuff that I

1649
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:28,448
There were so many moments that I really that you do just lose because it's

1650
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,008
Absolute non-stop insanity but the

1651
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,800
Craziest one was on

1652
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:33,824
Tuesday

1653
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:40,480
Day 2 or day one of the trial proper you know the day after jury selection opening statement

1654
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:46,880
Yeah in the middle of one of the brakes Alex is talking to the HBO documentarian on stream and it

1655
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,416
At one point he does say

1656
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,952
They don't have my texts

1657
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,024
How crazy is that

1658
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,328
How f****** wild is that

1659
01:57:55,584 --> 01:58:01,216
That was the wildest thing like going back. I was like that can't be real and I checked and I dates

1660
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,240
It's crazy

1661
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:04,032
Well again we have to

1662
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,312
But makes the point that

1663
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:11,968
Couldn't talk about other text Bono your tweets may or may not depict reality in any way

1664
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:16,064
So even happened are you imagine that

1665
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,600
Fair enough

1666
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:24,000
So Alex has said that he searched his phone and didn't find anything right

1667
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:26,816
Map of it

1668
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:30,912
You may have just committed perjury

1669
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:31,936
In Discovery

1670
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:32,960
You were at

1671
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
Do you have

1672
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,520
Sandy Hook text message

1673
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,288
On your phone

1674
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
Correct

1675
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:53,184
I told make sure you know before we go any further you know it is

1676
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:57,536
I told you I gave

1677
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,560
Did my text money

1678
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,584
The phone

1679
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,424
For whatever

1680
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,216
One more time

1681
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Please remember

1682
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
Will you testify

1683
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,152
Underoath

1684
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:15,200
Previously that you

1685
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Personal

1686
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,504
Search your phone

1687
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,040
For the precinct

1688
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,576
There were no message

1689
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
You said that under

1690
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:22,880
Yes

1691
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:32,608
When you say something that is then later found out to be not

1692
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:36,960
True right around her up and you knew that it was not true

1693
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Because

1694
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,776
It was you who said you did it

1695
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,056
And you didn't

1696
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,336
What is that called

1697
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,128
Not good

1698
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:48,992
Also applies to emails

1699
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:51,296
Aquatopia email using it

1700
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,392
Okay

1701
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:59,744
Do I have emails from

1702
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,280
About this case

1703
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:03,072
In the past couple years.

1704
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:13,824
You know in this case you were asking produced

1705
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,592
Your email

1706
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,152
New York

1707
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,176
Right

1708
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,712
You said you didn't have

1709
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,624
Underoath

1710
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,416
Sworn to God

1711
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,720
You said you don't have any email

1712
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,328
I mean

1713
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,192
Gmail

1714
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:45,568
Infowars.com

1715
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,152
Monopoly

1716
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:56,064
He keeps trying to bring it back to Infowars email as opposed to another email up thing and

1717
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:02,464
What Mark is doing is very clearly trying to establish like you lied again cuz I have any mail

1718
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:05,792
Well but like

1719
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:10,400
Be the attempt to wiggle out of it is just be constantly bringing up Infowars the Isles

1720
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,936
It's just not

1721
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:15,520
Not going to help earlier in the trial right now

1722
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:21,408
Triad been talking to Daria as the corporate representative that he objected to

1723
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,968
And then talk to her as the corporate representative

1724
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
He said like

1725
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:32,160
Alex doesn't have an email address right and she's like all it wouldn't he did he'd get a hundred million thousand emails a day

1726
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:36,512
So he got rid of it as though that would be later the excuse for what

1727
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:39,072
Now happens

1728
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,632
How did it go

1729
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,520
Also we go back to the text messages now we've already Illustrated that

1730
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:50,592
Paul had texted with Alex

1731
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:54,688
And told him it's a Sandy Hook all over again I get it

1732
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,224

1733
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,016
Another smother text

1734
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:01,600
Pierre from Tim fruge who's the business manager

1735
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,416

Alaska

1742
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:24,896
They didn't even look through text

1743
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,248
No

1744
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:35,648

Discovery is

1752
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:18,656
Is a process that occurs and concludes well before trial

1753
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:24,800
What's lawyers say isn't evidence

1754
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,336
So

1755
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:30,432
We don't know whether it was on accident

1756
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,736
Debbie Doo

1757
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:34,528
They don't have evidence about that

1758
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:39,136
It wasn't properly turned over

1759
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,672
When it should have been

1760
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,512
But there's no question

1761
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:50,912
Okay so there is a fair objection there because you're asserting that he

1762
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,704
Did this accident LaRue

1763
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,240
You can't prove that

1764
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
Mommy kind

1765
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,360
What you have is text about finances

1766
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:00,384
That are

1767
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,944
Like here's the numbers for this day

1768
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,760
And then Alex

1769
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528
Just didn't

1770
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,296
Turn those off

1771
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,880
That's real bad it does appear that

1772
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,464
I do think I do think there's an argument to be made

1773
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,768
That you can say that he didn't mean to do it

1774
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:19,584
Because the original did email back like

1775
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:21,376
Please disregard

1776
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:27,776
Yeah which isn't legally doesn't mean anything

1777
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:30,336
He can't he can't do that without without

1778
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,272
That email response

1779
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:43,136
I'm so one of the things that critical about the revelation of these texts

1780
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:49,536
Is that they illustrate financial information that was demanded and ordered from Alex writes that was not

1781
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
Turned over

1782
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:52,608
But more for my purposes

1783
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:54,144
They also reveal

1784
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,936
But Alex is full of s***

1785
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,472
Victor Cruz

1786
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,752
Bruce

1787
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,544
How do I say

1788
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
Agree with me

1789
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,664
The pretty much everyday

1790
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:07,200
He send you an update

1791
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:08,992
How much stores are sold

1792
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,040
And sometimes you let you know how much property

1793
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:16,416
He says 110

1794
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:18,464
Gross sales in food

1795
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,000
Equates to almost

1796
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:20,768
70

1797
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:21,536
Hey

1798
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,560
Pure

1799
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:35,616
Okay

1800
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,640
To look

1801
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,944
This makes total sense

1802
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:44,576
Yeah there's a 20 to 40% profit margin on the food and like

1803
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:47,904
You just let that go in your car

1804
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:50,720
She's not paying anything for the food

1805
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:57,120
It's not like he buys it from my Patriot Supply and then sends it to people he's not resale

1806
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:03,520
He's essentially getting a cut of what the business is no overhead

1807
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,824
It is all pure profit yep

1808
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:10,944
Tonight also illustrates testified to earlier just that.

1809
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:12,992
20 to 40% profit margin

1810
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,016
Is lotus

1811
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,832
100 / 7 no risk

1812
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:19,136
No exposure on the food

1813
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:25,536
Maybe things are different with the private labeling maybe with his supplements Inception he has to buy a bow

1814
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:31,936
Bunch and then resell it possible but yeah for the food that's not the case at all let me know even did like

1815
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,472
Dropshipping from

1816
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:36,288
The my Patriot Supply

1817
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,312
Goddamn

1818
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:44,224
I-70 Caso only 110 units is 70,000 a prophet

1819
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:50,624
Think that probably is an unreliable statistics at like Universe lies because I don't know I wouldn't I wouldn't have two different

1820
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,648
Print size

1821
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:54,464
Buckets and then things that they sell

1822
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
So like

1823
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,280
It's not a uniform

1824
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:03,936
Commission I am

1825
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:10,336
Pretty sweet not a bad gig pretty sweet molly have to do is say stuff and then they give you money all you have to do

1826
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:16,224
Do is convince everyone that they won't get food tomorrow I may need a rifle bucket

1827
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,784
Yeah so here is Mark's dismount

1828
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,088
Install

1829
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,880
Your revenues

1830
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,928
From 20

1831
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,256
Cioppino

1832
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,960
A couple of months

1833
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,008
But not a whole lot of sales

1834
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,800
I'm not drink

1835
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:45,152
So remind me to talk about 2016 28

1836
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,016
165 mower

1837
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:57,952
That's gross

1838
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,768
That maybe doesn't we have to calculate what your property

1839
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
All of those Millions

1840
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:18,176
Are you aware

1841
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,456
Have your attorney

1842
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:29,440
That your company

1843
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,720
Admit

1844
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:31,744
Underoath

1845
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:34,304
Do your corporate representative the cops real

1846
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:36,608
Your

1847
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,424
Dear creeper

1848
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,808
Slamming the door

1849
02:08:56,064 --> 02:09:01,952
I don't think there is any reason to ask you anymore questions what a great way to just call it now

1850
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:05,024
So good so yeah

1851
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:10,656
You know this a little theatrical inasmuch as you pull out a dollar and be like this is it

1852
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:13,984
That's what we're doing come on his moments

1853
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:20,384
I'm fine with it in this context but but yeah

1854
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:26,784
Not correct

1855
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,576
Is so funny

1856
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:32,928
You trusted your

1857
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:36,000
Lawyers to produce the relevant document

1858
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,280
Yes

1859
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,584
Cooperated with us in every way

1860
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,888
You trusted us to do

1861
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,192
A good job in turnover will you turn over

1862
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,752
Turn it over

1863
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,408
Norfolk weather

1864
02:09:54,176 --> 02:10:00,320
This is the end that is that is one situation where Alex did not realize that his lawyer

1865
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:05,184
There was no longer working for him his lawyer was working for right now

1866
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:11,840
Cover-your-ass he said no to all of us

1867
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,376
Testimony took

1868
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:17,216

That Alex is it with the compensatory damages of 4.1 million

1872
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:31,808
And

1873
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:35,904
News breaks past the point that Alex is on air

1874
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,696
Oh and so on

02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,488
Is hosting the War Room

1876
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,512
At this point

1877
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:42,304
Complaining about

1878
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:43,840
I don't know

1879
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:44,608
The Chinese

1880
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:46,400
Probably sounds right

1881
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:51,008
It secures at him at discussing that they're the Judgment has come in

1882
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:53,824

In

1887
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,224
The Sandy Hook case

1888
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:01,760
And they got

1889
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,040
4 million-dollar judgement

1890
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:10,208
And now they got a for million-dollar

1891
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,488
Verdict which

02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,256
Is

1893
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:16,864
The shooting 400

1894
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:18,912
Line their pockets I guess

1895
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:23,008
That money goes

1896
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:27,616
Jeremiah

1897
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,992
There might be a statement from Alex Jones soon

1898
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:36,064
He might go live he might pop in I don't know

1899
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,160
Okay

1900
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:46,048
Good news

1901
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,192
So

1902
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:55,264
Just stay tuned there will be a statement from Alex

1903
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,032
Shortly

1904
02:11:56,288 --> 02:12:01,408
That is such a funny wine a way of dis

1905
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:07,808
Look now I can't even cover the news

1906
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:14,208
The news has many words

1907
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:15,488
Look at what these

1908
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:22,400
People have done to me and who knows where that money is going what an hour trying to make suspicious stew

1909
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,704
Of a lawsuit

1910
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,008
And so he's right

1911
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:33,920
I would still pop in later share so that's one thing I was right about Scott he's winning in the talk show predictions

1912
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:38,272
He's right about Alex was filming a statement

1913
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,552
Before he came on

1914
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:41,088
I took here is that

1915
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,648

Lined up

1919
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:52,608
The judge

1920
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:53,888
Anytime

1921
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:54,912
The last

1922
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,704
In Austin Tech

1923
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,752
Surgery while I was

1924
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:00,544
In the courtroom

1925
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,360
The Alex Jones

1926
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Is guilty

1927
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:07,200

Dollars

1931
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:14,880
When

1932
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:21,792
I admit it I was

1933
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
I admitted that I

1934
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:26,144
Politician

1935
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,424
Information but not on purpose

1936
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,448
I apologize

1937
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:31,776
Understood

1938
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
What I did

1939
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,360
What's wrong

1940
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,432
I didn't lie about

1941
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,736
And I ran a god

1942
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:42,784
I

1943
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,552
Question

1944
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:46,624
Anomalies

1945
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
That other song

1946
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,696
Sherry under

1947
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,048
Your money

1948
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:54,816
My company

1949
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
And I purchase

1950
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,472
What a great guy

1951
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:07,872
So I think the three billion number is meant to make the judgement look even smaller trying to figure out

1952
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:14,272
Where they came from and I think it's the sales figures that Mark showed from

1953
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,296
From the text messages

1954
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:21,952
That proves he was sending over okay they were like it was like what eight hundred

1955
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:26,560
$1 a day late it out to like 300 million in a year

1956
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:32,960
Over 20 years overtime overtime Sandy Hook

1957
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,496
Even remember if Mark

1958
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:40,896
Made any statement of three billion fright but it's like Ok Google three hundred million dollars a year ten years since

1959
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:44,992
If the theory 3 billion dollars yeah sense then

1960
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:50,880
I think that's where Alex may be taking that number from that I never heard that as like what he

1961
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:56,512
Should be penalized I really really really really wish that

1962
02:14:57,024 --> 02:15:00,096
The way that that amount of money was reported

1963
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:00,864
Was

1964
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:07,264
Abased on why it was chosen like I understand that 24% of America

1965
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,312
Kansas 75 million Americans

1966
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:10,592
So the idea

1967
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:16,992
Is $1 for each American symbolism

1968
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:22,368
Do they want money or it was about how huge the sum was if they really just like

1969
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,392
Listen

1970
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,416
The Sandy Hook

1971
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:27,488
Families believe that they that

1972
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,512
Because of Alex

1973
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:32,352
Alex owes them $1 for person that believes that they're a liar

1974
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:35,168
You know that makes sense to me

1975
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:38,496
It also makes it feel like the Judgment isn't that high

1976
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:44,896
Because if you'd said that they owed $10 per person I wouldn't think that that's a huge judgment and that's 1.5 billion

1977
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:50,016
Dollars

1978
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:56,672
You know you don't start a negotiation low number that you

1979
02:15:56,928 --> 02:16:00,256
You don't necessarily expect you're going to

1980
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:03,328
Misunderstanding of the symbolism I agree with you that could have been

1981
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:09,216
Was really important about the money and not the money and that's what was so frustrating

1982
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,544
Alex's statement goes on

1983
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,896
Judge realize

1984
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,456
I walked

1985
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,272
SeaWorld

1986
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:23,040
Today

1987
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:23,808
Course he did

1988
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,088
Punitive damage

1989
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
Tomorrow

1990
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,160
I

1991
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,184
Cannot testify

1992
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,232
And my lawyer

1993
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,608
And told her

1994
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:40,960
And now she's saying

1995
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:46,080
I trusted

1996
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
I trust

1997
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,664
So this just isn't true

1998
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:55,040
Retinol gave a defense in the punitive phase of the trial just as wested for the plaintiff

1999
02:16:55,296 --> 02:17:01,440
The defense wasn't able to call any Witnesses because the purpose of that phase of the trial was to determine net worth of

2000
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:03,232
Systems

2001
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:08,352
And after repeatedly failing to provide Order documents and repeatedly sending an incompetent

2002
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:12,704
Corporate Representatives the sanctioned Alex's defense by disallowing him

2003
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:16,288
Her being able to participate in the Networth discussion at this point

2004
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:21,152
Essentially this is not a silencing or an instance of Alex being jammed up

2005
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:22,944
It's just another case of him

2006
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:29,344
Not doing the bare minimum he was required to do in the discovery phase of the case and now it's too late for him to pretend

2007
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,624
He wants to be involved

2008
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,648
Plus

2009
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:38,048
Alex violated the rules on multiple occasions the prior today including the line to the jury by saying he was bankrupt so I'm

2010
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:39,072
Alone

2011
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:42,144
He should not be able to be a witness in this part of the case

2012
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:50,848
Nothing that you said can really be accepted as credible so his evidentiary value 10 unless he were to have produced

2013
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:52,384
Documents backing up what he says

2014
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,432
Which brings us to the next problem

2015
02:17:54,944 --> 02:18:01,088
What are the primary things it was brought up as it relates to his text being disclosed was the messages from Tim fruge which discuss

2016
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:02,880
Detailed breakdowns of sales number

2017
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:09,792
These numbers did not match the revenue numbers that Alex's claims and even more importantly the existence of these texts

2018
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:11,584
Which were not turned over in Discovery

2019
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:15,936
Revealing attempt to hide information relevant to the determination of net worth

2020
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,216
And the company's value

2021
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:24,128
There are three major reasons that Alex is not being allowed to be a part of this phase of the trial and it has nothing to do with the demo

2022
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:26,176
Democratic party or conspiracy against him

2023
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:29,248
It's a simple consequences of his stupid action

2024
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:36,416
You can probably get the basic tone of this announcement already it's Alex taking this for million-dollar judgment

2025
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:39,744
Because it's much lower than he was probably fearing

2026
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:46,400
His tone is essentially no different than when he's got another bad news in the past where he's using it as an opportunity to fund

2027
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,424
Andres off of it

2028
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:53,312
More less trying to get the audience to flip the bill for him so he can remain insulated from the consequences of his actions

2029
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,592
It's pathetic

2030
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:58,432
But it's what you'd expect because he's always been able to do this before

2031
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:05,088
Whether it's his dad for the medical bills that Katie almost killed or his dad buying advertising on his shows or radio

2032
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,880
Station with air hammer Leon

2033
02:19:07,136 --> 02:19:13,280
Or the audience donating to his suspiciously time to money bombs or this suspiciously * 8 million

2034
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:14,560
Are Bitcoin donation

2035
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:18,912
Alex has always had people to bail him out of the trouble of his stupid action

2036
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:24,032
He probably thinks based on his $4000000 figure this is just going to be another in that series

2037
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:26,592
Yeah little reason for him

2038
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:29,408
Not to think that I mean if if

2039
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,944
If it were me

2040
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,296
An Alex issues I would have received that judgment as

2041
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,832
A massive victory

2042
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:39,136
But that's only because

2043
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:41,184
As if it's me and Alex issues

2044
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:45,024
I much like Alex have forgotten that there more trials coming

2045
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:48,864
I have completely forgotten that that means

2046
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:55,520
More judgments are coming as well so I am I'm Overjoyed I am announcing my victory over the demo

2047
02:19:55,776 --> 02:20:01,152
Democratic Party

2048
02:20:01,408 --> 02:20:03,200
So yeah the plaintiff lawyers

2049
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:05,248
They were not happy about

2050
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:07,552
They don't like that Alex won

2051
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:12,160
I'm at peace

2052
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:13,952
Patricia Steele

2053
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,720
Play major

2054
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:15,744
Victory Ford

2055
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:17,280
And the plane

2056
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:18,048
Employers

2057
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,400
Screaming

2058
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,424
Yelling

2059
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:24,448
My lawyer

2060
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:25,984
Joe

2061
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:27,008
Andino

2062
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,312
They thought they were

2063
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,152
They thought they were

2064
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:33,920
Shut us down

2065
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:35,712
But that jury

2066
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:38,528
Addresses

2067
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,368
Besides it's not at all

2068
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,136
Match

2069
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:45,440
My experience with the flight to Sluggers

2070
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:51,072
I mean I don't know I don't know who these two sources Alex has but I think that their lieutenant colonel's

2071
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:51,840
Probably

2072
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,632
It is it is this

2073
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,168
Exact

2074
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,192
Video

2075
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,240
That it should be played

2076
02:20:58,496 --> 02:21:00,800
Further in in in the other trial

2077
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:02,080
Just because

2078
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:02,848
This was

2079
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,128
After the judgment

2080
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:07,968
Yeah if you think that damages are going to make him stop

2081
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:11,552
And he can still be in business that is not how this works

2082
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:14,112
He's in there and he is doing his s***

2083
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:15,136
Or he's out

2084
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:17,440
There is no getting him to moderate

2085
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:23,840
Yeah but I think that's difficult to think you and I can save

2086
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:24,608
I think is

2087
02:21:26,656 --> 02:21:32,800
You know 100% the future which are you can't do in a courtroom I assumed but it also presupposes

2088
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:35,360
It is appropriate to be like

2089
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:37,920
I want to bankrupt him as a punishment

2090
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,712
And I know is that

2091
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:46,112
Is necessarily healthy

2092
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:46,880
So important

2093
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,160
It is not that

2094
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:53,024
I understand bankruptcy in this way

2095
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,096
If the points of the trial

2096
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:57,888
It's the point of the damages

2097
02:21:58,144 --> 02:22:02,240
Is to punish someone to get them to stop their behavior

2098
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,264
Right

2099
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,056
And this is what they do

2100
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:06,592
After that judgement

2101
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:09,664
Then it's not about money at that point it has to be

2102
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,712
How do we make this Behavior stop

2103
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:17,344
I don't care if the judgment is 10 bajillion dollars or it's literally just a guy going like Hey listen

2104
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:24,256
You got to turn the lights off that's that's just what's got to happen it's not about the money kind of thing you know what I said

2105
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:26,048
Translate that from

2106
02:22:26,304 --> 02:22:31,936
What I think you're saying that makes total sense in this conversation to a courtroom I think that's a challenge

2107
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:38,336
And it's also an incredibly difficult because you know when you have something like this happen

2108
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:40,640
It's just an opportunity for Alex to

2109
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:44,224
Mail truck is audience and then I get more money

2110
02:22:44,992 --> 02:22:45,504
Where in Bangkok

2111
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:54,464
Your sovereignty

2112
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:55,488
Not your fault

2113
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:56,768
The fight we have a

2114
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:58,048
Plan to stay on here

2115
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,072
Through the Spectre

2116
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:01,888
You don't fund

2117
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,912
If you don't buy Prada

2118
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:04,960
Dot-com

2119
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:07,776
Your decision

2120
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,336
Right now

2121
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,408
To stay on

2122
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:15,456
We are

2123
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,272
Broke

2124
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,064
Even worried about that

2125
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:22,880
I'm worried about

2126
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:23,648
Our bank

2127
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,440
Emergency

2128
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:29,536
To do that we

2129
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:35,936
Underoath have been proven to be great

2130
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,472
Wild

2131
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:40,032
Just wild share

2132
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:46,432
It's exactly what you'd expect

2133
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:48,224
X2go the direction it does

2134
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:48,992
Because

2135
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:54,880
When there's a direction to go from there if yes all God he starts talking about kneeling Scarlet

2136
02:23:55,136 --> 02:23:56,160
No

2137
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:59,744
Mike Mike Mike

2138
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:00,768
Animal

2139
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:02,560
Calm and keep

2140
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:04,864
That is so

2141
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:13,568
Woke up the

2142
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:18,688
Stop talking

2143
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
I was wrong

2144
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:25,856
I admit

2145
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:27,648
Prouder than

2146
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:29,952
I don't

2147
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:32,256
For tomorrow

2148
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:35,584
These people

2149
02:24:36,352 --> 02:24:36,864
Trident missile

2150
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,888
Represent what I said

2151
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:39,936
LG video

2152
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:40,960
They showed the

2153
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:43,520
Backfired

2154
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:47,616
Yeah so he's creating this perception that

2155
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:48,640
Like

2156
02:24:49,152 --> 02:24:50,432
Niall and Scarlett

2157
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:52,224
Are info Warriors now

2158
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:55,040
Woke up to

2159
02:24:55,296 --> 02:25:01,440
The fact that their lawyers were manipulating the comments about the previous clips

2160
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:07,840
Said come too soon and I would like to reiterate him about that clip but like twice as much

2161
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:09,120
Locked up

2162
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,032
And my lawyer

2163
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:21,920

2164
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:25,760
Carl Lewis

2165
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,112
Is it about Duncan

2166
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:31,136
Control is about

2167
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:32,672
It's about teaching

2168
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:33,696
Auburn love

2169
02:25:34,208 --> 02:25:34,720
Take a passion

2170
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:35,744
Not hateful

2171
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,560
And I've invited

2172
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:40,096
On my shelf

2173
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,144
Email organization

2174
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,680
If I see her tomorrow

2175
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,520
That I am

2176
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:48,800
Gladly

2177
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:50,592
Hamper on my show

2178
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,896
Next week I'm going to raise money

2179
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:54,176
For her organization

2180
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:55,200
On top

2181
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:57,248
Of the big judge

2182
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,296
Because she's a real

2183
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:00,576
She lost

2184
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:01,344
Child

2185
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,368
I'm not going to let

2186
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:07,232
Claims that I'm a Sandy

2187
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:09,280
Beautiful

2188
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:10,816
Creighton

2189
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:12,608
Call lawyers

2190
02:26:13,376 --> 02:26:14,912
The ambulance Chasers lost

2191
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,192
America and

2192
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:17,728
1

2193
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:20,032
Corporate

2194
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:22,848
Charlotte Lewis

2195
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,408
So this is a big

2196
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:31,552
So close

2197
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:33,856
Deportes

2198
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Have Scarlet

2199
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
Their lawyers are

2200
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:40,256
Stop

2201
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:42,560
You'll try to follow me

2202
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
I'll never

2203
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:51,520
Foxes

2204
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,288
A dog

2205
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,592
I'll see you tomorrow

2206
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:08,672
I was in the courtroom during his opening statement asked the jury to return a judgement of $1 in Damages

2207
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:15,072
Call he asked the jury held the dollar up it was very smart was he hurt

2208
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:18,400
Closing statement in the cross-examination

2209
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:24,800
Such a disgusting liar and it's just exploited audiences obvious lack of awareness

2210
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:26,592
So what's actually happening in the trial

2211
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:32,736
Galaxy

2212
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:34,272
All this is complete s***

2213
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:35,808
More importantly

2214
02:27:36,064 --> 02:27:38,368
Alex knows fully well that he's just lying to his audience

2215
02:27:38,624 --> 02:27:39,904
So they keep giving him money

2216
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:43,488
Also like to eat Scarlet has a great organization

2217
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,120
He's corporate representative Daria Underoath testified that she suspects that it's a front

2218
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,144
Yep

2219
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:55,520
Also this is Alex's attempt to portray himself as the good guy which is all based in bulshit

2220
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:56,544
Further

2221
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:02,688
He's putting meal and Scarlett into a trap where he's casting them as characters in his personal image rehabilitation

2222
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:09,344
As far as the audience is concerned they either get to play along and act how Alex is setting them up to which they aren't going to do

2223
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,696
Do suspiciously by the audience all over again

2224
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:19,840
Why aren't they speaking out in support of Alex after they realized they were being used by the lawyer's to attack the First Amendment

2225
02:28:20,352 --> 02:28:26,496
Maybe the evil lawyers won't let them or maybe their daddy just said that to Alex to pacify him during the trial match

2226
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:29,568
We are in League with the Deep State Democrat lawyers after all

2227
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:35,968
Come to think of it that would mean that they would have put on a pretty good performance to trick Alex of all people

2228
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:36,992
Tractor Central

2229
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:43,648
Maybe that's not the direction it would necessarily go but Alex is forcing meal and Scarlett to exist in terms of his bulshit show

2230
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:46,976
Into the future because created these fictitious pictures of them

2231
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:50,304
He's helpful in terms of making Alex feel better about himself

2232
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:55,424
What are you really should be doing is leaving them to the f*** alone which they've wanted all along

2233
02:28:56,192 --> 02:29:02,336
But Alex is kind of like a child whose broken something and then he's trying to clean it up but he doesn't know how to clean sew in

2234
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:04,384
The process he ends up breaking more stuff

2235
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:08,736
You just want them to stop trying to help because they're not helping that is making things worse

2236
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:10,528
But they're dumb kid and they don't get

2237
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:17,440
He's kind of like that kid except you broke that original thing on purpose he claims that he didn't and then he's breaking other stuff

2238
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:19,488
Stuff to distract from a messy initially made

2239
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:23,328
It's like a sociopathic version of that kid who broke something

2240
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:24,096
Yeah

2241
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:26,144
He's a f****** a******

2242
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:27,168
That's so funny

2243
02:29:27,424 --> 02:29:32,544
But that's another part of the amorphous blob of denying Sandy Hook that's it now

2244
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,568
I get it

2245
02:29:33,824 --> 02:29:36,384
I say Sandy Hook is 100% real

2246
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,432
Because I've changed the goalposts

2247
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:44,832
To now the lawyers are manipulating these people that is just the same thing it's always

2248
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:51,232
One bright big thing is not that he denied Sandy Hook happened it's at Sandy Hook is part of

2249
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,328
Whatever it is he want you understand that that is exactly the model

2250
02:29:55,584 --> 02:30:01,728
You have you have you have to play the full clip Play the full clip oh I need a timeline, timeline

2251
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:03,008
Mine doesn't be another excuse

2252
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:09,408
Even like think about it in terms of world events like you have this lead up to the 2016 elections like we need

2253
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:15,808
Need to get Trump in because if you have a democrat in now it's so bad Trump gets in Ono there's enemies Within

2254
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:22,208
Upstate is everything sucks yeah it's always something else

2255
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:28,352
The conspiracy in the narrative has to shift because that is where the money is Fright that is where the

2256
02:30:28,608 --> 02:30:32,192
Ability to keep his audience interested is that

2257
02:30:32,448 --> 02:30:33,216
Like oh

2258
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:38,592
We we 1 or 0 I was actually wrong let's move on right doesn't play

2259
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:41,152
There isn't an angle he's just a coward

2260
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:42,688
Well yeah that too

2261
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:44,992
So it does have the balls

2262
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:47,808
The show up on the in the war room

2263
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:54,208
Hello boy hard-hitting interview with earlier adversarial

2264
02:30:54,464 --> 02:31:00,608
Patient with the Press conversation with Owen wants a paycheck. Clearing but

2265
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:03,424
Now it's friendly

2266
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:08,032
Alex's recorded this announcement and statement and he comes on with Owen

2267
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:11,104
This kind of rehashing some of the same stuff

2268
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:14,688
But he has some other things that he says that I think are really shity

2269
02:31:15,968 --> 02:31:22,112
Titanic violin

2270
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:23,648
Baby

2271
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:30,048
Not very good at it

2272
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:34,912
No not because he told you about the globalist corporate world government the carbon tax is what

2273
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:36,704
They've destroyed him now

2274
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:39,264
And the lies get to permeate on Twitter

2275
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,336
Defend yourself

2276
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,384
I tried it here we are

2277
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,664
The jury came in

2278
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:49,760
On the big verdict tens of millions spent by the Democratic party law firms

2279
02:31:50,272 --> 02:31:52,576
And the jury came in at 4.2 million

2280
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:54,112
When I asked for

2281
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:56,416
150 million two days ago

2282
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:58,208
3 billion yesterday

2283
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:00,000
I don't have $2000000

2284
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:01,792
The banker

2285
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:03,072
Anywhere

2286
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:05,376
Seems like a bland version of Triumph

2287
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:11,264
For him do you know how to use this Victory to it but it's also also

2288
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,056
Spent tens of Millions on that

2289
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:18,688
So I guess what do you need to think that cuz then you win

2290
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:27,648
Right

2291
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:34,048
Yeah Alex can't be like listen the law firm that they're specifically when

2292
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:34,816
Went through

2293
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:38,912
I've ugly plaintiffs attorney said that he only eats what he

2294
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:39,680
He kills

2295
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:42,240
So obviously they spent yeah

2296
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:45,824
According to Alex on war room

2297
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:49,152
The good news is it's very low verdict for what they're asking for

2298
02:32:49,408 --> 02:32:50,944
The bad news is we don't have the money

2299
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:53,504
Banda.

2300
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,576
Morning before that's why I want to see the War Room

2301
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:59,904
Are you want to see I'll show you want to see her you want to see

2302
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:07,840
Did everybody here we need your support and infowarsstore.com

2303
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:11,168
And I would testify tomorrow which under Texas law

2304
02:33:14,496 --> 02:33:17,312
The judge ruled after the ruling today

2305
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:21,152
I got that low ruling sounds a person it is odd

2306
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:22,944
But for the RAV4 small

2307
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:27,296
Cannot speak tomorrow and my lawyer can I put on evidence

2308
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:31,136
Because words of faulted so she gets more and more desperate

2309
02:33:31,392 --> 02:33:37,536
As she rigged this whole thing but not matter what the Judgment was he would not be allowed to participate

2310
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:39,840
Dissipate is no bearing on any of that

2311
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:46,240
I mean you just can't commit perjury one day and then still come back the next day about financial stuff

2312
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:53,920
The the sanctions in terms of the default judgment like

2313
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:59,040
A big part of it is not cooperating with this stuff

2314
02:33:59,296 --> 02:34:01,600
There was a time to provide that

2315
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:04,416
Very much didn't

2316
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:11,072
I was given multiple opportunities to clear that up and fix that you don't like swoop in

2317
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:12,352
And then be like aha

2318
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:18,496
Now I will reveal

2319
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:21,056
It's that example of

2320
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:26,176
But you're never going to win you know like with Alex lives in a reality where he

2321
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:29,760
He always wins so you're never going to get him to be like

2322
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,296
Oh are your right

2323
02:34:31,552 --> 02:34:35,392
I I f***** up you know in a way that means anything

2324
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:41,792
Exactly so you just switches into a different world and if he's guilty in this world even switching to add a different one

2325
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:46,400
Crazy MC you buddy

2326
02:34:46,656 --> 02:34:48,448
So obviously this is all

2327
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:49,216
Just trying to

2328
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,240
Get money

2329
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:54,592
And the Alex. He'll be making more money honestly and he's a little disappointed

2330
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:57,664
I don't say this

2331
02:34:58,688 --> 02:34:59,456
Where in bankrupt

2332
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:01,760
And I thought

2333
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:02,528
And bankrupt

2334
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:05,600
We can bring in the money we need it right now or not

2335
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:06,624

Critical juncture in the fight

2345
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:30,176
The last game as the basketball game

2346
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:32,224

The big boy pants

2350
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,904
Now is the time to side

2351
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,440

I'll Never back down I'll Never Surrender

2353
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:45,536
I'll never go away

2354
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,560
But I could give out

2355
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:47,584
Please Deportes

2356
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:48,864
Where should I go

2357
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:51,424
It is once again big boy pants time

2358
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,776
All right big boy pants time

2359
02:35:56,032 --> 02:36:00,640
I regret to inform you it is big boy pants time time

2360
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,664
Nick Walker

2361
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:04,480
Sure that meme

2362
02:36:04,992 --> 02:36:07,040
Someone made

2363
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:09,856
I struggled with it a little bit

2364
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,136
Because

2365
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:14,976
A little unfair it's a little unfair also think about it like

2366
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:21,376
You know you're the Nick the Doughboys comparison picture of us on rivals

2367
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:27,776
You're married next married okay

2368
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:29,056
Mitch has cat okay

2369
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:32,128
Squinty eyes both of us have squinty eyes

2370
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:38,784
I grew up in Boston for a while he's from Quincy

2371
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:44,672
More than I'm comfortable with that I didn't realize do you like hot salad

2372
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:51,072
I've never acted honestly I have no Dough Boys references whatsoever I didn't know whatever people whenever that may

2373
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:52,096
Season came out

2374
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:52,864
I was like

2375
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,448
I really don't know who Nick and Mitch are I was like wait

2376
02:36:56,960 --> 02:37:03,104
Hi I love the boys and I would honestly say want to me to come on

2377
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:09,504
But I do not

2378
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,064
Think the cakes or pies I was like

2379
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:18,464
I don't have any I haven't shaved in a while that was my reaction to that picture I'm sorry cupcakes

2380
02:37:18,720 --> 02:37:20,000
Cupcakes

2381
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:21,536
That is not a pie

2382
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:23,584
Until the day I die that is not a pie

2383
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:26,912
That threw me for anyway

2384
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:29,984
Big boy pants

2385
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:34,336
In this interview that Alex is doing on the War Room

2386
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:36,640
Keyframes

2387
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:40,736
The why people are mad about him but Sandy Hook in a particular way

2388
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,808
What's correct the record on a couple things here Alex

2389
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:45,600
The media today says

2390
02:37:45,856 --> 02:37:46,624
Alex Jones

2391
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:55,072
We barely less than one-tenth of 1%.

2392
02:37:56,096 --> 02:37:57,376
But when Hillary ran against Trump

2393
02:37:57,632 --> 02:37:58,656
Dreads

2394
02:37:58,912 --> 02:37:59,424
The question

2395
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:01,728
What's the Monopoly but it turned out

2396
02:38:01,984 --> 02:38:03,520
Probably

2397
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:09,920
So the whole thing about why people are mad about Sandy Hook

2398
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:11,712
Alphabet something and Alex's easy

2399
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:17,856
You may remember this as the entire framing device of how Sandy Hook is covered in Alex's War

2400
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:20,928
The shity documentary made by Alex Lee Moyer

2401
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:24,768
And I think that you see how

2402
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:28,352
Patently absurd this is and how

2403
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:31,936
Easily tricked

2404
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:37,056
Yeah I mean that is that's that's a moment where you either got to go

2405
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:43,456
I'm going to be 100% complicit in this Ava Braun or you have to go I might be shity at my job

2406
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,248
Whoops

2407
02:38:45,504 --> 02:38:46,016
So

2408
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:50,880
Let's not dwell too much on this cuz I already did that episode and

2409
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:52,928
I was

2410
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:59,328
Blocked and then unblocked by their Twitter account about it

2411
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:00,608
What happened

2412
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:06,240
There's something really terrible about the way Alex precedes

2413
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:07,520
To the end of this episode

2414
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:10,592
In that special report announcement thing he did

2415
02:39:11,104 --> 02:39:14,432
Now there's a characterization of scarlet and Niall

2416
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:17,248
And it's unfair yeah it's inappropriate

2417
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:19,296
But what Alex does

2418
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,832
Now is worse

2419
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:23,648
I am very thankful to God everything for the listeners

2420
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:27,232
And I want invite start Lewis who doesn't have a gun control group

2421
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:28,512
She has a

2422
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:32,352
Group about children learning

2423
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:33,120
And helping

2424
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,168
People are being bullied

2425
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:36,448
So they don't become SI

2426
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:37,216
Totally

2427
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:39,008
Supporter groups use love

2428
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:41,824
Play My Worship by and gave me a hug repeatedly

2429
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,640
I told her regardless of this ruling

2430
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:46,176
I want earlier

2431
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:48,224
So tomorrow I'm barred from speak

2432
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,064
At the trial but I'm going to go with the letter I'm going to write tonight

2433
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:56,160
Reply

2434
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:59,744
Watching them on purpose I I didn't try to hurt them

2435
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,536
Once I messed up my salt.

2436
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,072
Why I was

2437
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:04,608
I was brought into stuff that was

2438
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:11,008
But you never even said their name

2439
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:12,288
Still

2440
02:40:14,592 --> 02:40:15,616
This is harassment

2441
02:40:16,128 --> 02:40:19,456
Could Alex is planning out on air

2442
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:20,480
Yeah yes

2443
02:40:20,992 --> 02:40:26,368
Yeah this is me to talk to them

2444
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:29,440
So I'm going to write a letter and slip it to them

2445
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:35,840
So I can invade their space I'm going to go to their house when they're lawyers aren't there and I'm going to slide

2446
02:40:36,096 --> 02:40:41,472
This letter underneath their doorstep you know like a sane person who's not harassing people would do right

2447
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:47,872
Wow Scarlet in particular Alex seems to be wanting to paint as

2448
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:49,152
This is a new best friend

2449
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,688
This is just

2450
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:51,456
Awful

2451
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:52,480
Tuesday

2452
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,552
The morning show

2453
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:57,600
Brower you came in and took over

2454
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:58,624
And I said

2455
02:40:59,392 --> 02:41:00,160
I believe

2456
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:00,928
He's a real person

2457
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:01,696
I believe you

2458
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:04,512
And I'm sorry

2459
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:07,328
They cut it down to a minute

2460
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,376
With me saying it didn't happen

2461
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:12,448
Video so blurry

2462
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,984
It's all blurry

2463
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:18,080
Oh my God I said

2464
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,104
Charlotte

2465
02:41:20,128 --> 02:41:20,640
Go to the

2466
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:22,688
Go to 40

2467
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,760
Go to 33 after in my show today

2468
02:41:26,784 --> 02:41:28,320
I said you're real

2469
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:29,600
I said Your son's real

2470
02:41:29,856 --> 02:41:31,648
Whoever gave that to use a liar

2471
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:34,720
She got up and left him back an hour later crying it was like

2472
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,072
So so we broke through

2473
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:43,680
That they're being handled and manipulated this way video

2474
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:46,240
She said I'm staying I was given it by

2475
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:47,264
My supporters

2476
02:41:48,288 --> 02:41:50,336
Your point is they gave her a minute edited video

2477
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:53,664
Echoes I believe you're real

2478
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:55,712
I believe your son. I'm so sorry

2479
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:57,248
I want to work with you

2480
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:59,296
And I believe that your ex-husband

2481
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:00,320
Sean.

2482
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:01,600
He's a great guy

2483
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:04,416
I think they

2484
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:05,184
Smart

2485
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:09,280
He's a cowboy

2486
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:12,608
I've been like that

2487
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,888
So

2488
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:16,192
She apparently

2489
02:42:16,448 --> 02:42:20,032
And watch the full video then Alex's referring her to

2490
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,568
She wept

2491
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,360
And then told Alex

2492
02:42:23,616 --> 02:42:26,944
That she gets it and she's being used by these lawyers

2493
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:30,528
I genuinely

2494
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:31,808
Genuinely

2495
02:42:33,088 --> 02:42:35,136
Think she should sue for defamation

2496
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:42,816
I mean I don't know what else to say about that that is defaming you might I would I would take that as defaming a character

2497
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:44,352
I really would

2498
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:47,424
Yeah I really would take the idea of you

2499
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,472
Claiming that she

2500
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:52,800
A person who I f****** don't deserve

2501
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:55,104
To be anywhere near her she's so strong

2502
02:42:55,360 --> 02:42:56,896
And powerful and amazing

2503
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:58,688
To claim that she is your friend

2504
02:42:59,200 --> 02:42:59,968
Alex Jones

2505
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:01,504
Is so f***** up

2506
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,112
Yeah so f***** up I think that one of the

2507
02:43:06,368 --> 02:43:09,184
Central things about what makes

2508
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:15,328
This soap like the experience so painful is that you're being like is the parents of this

2509
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:16,864
Child who was killed

2510
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:23,264
You're being deprived of your ability to experience your life on your own terms someone else is curry

2511
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,800
Creating a caricature review

2512
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:27,360
And it's deeply painful and Alex's doing

2513
02:43:27,872 --> 02:43:29,920
So here's Eric happened

2514
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:32,736
Alex created a diorama

2515
02:43:32,992 --> 02:43:36,832
And then dropped it around them and trapped it in there for years

2516
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:43,232
4 years and they finally f****** got out of it so Alex is just building a different diorama that he's trying to

2517
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:44,000
To trap them with

2518
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:49,632
And here's our last clip for episode for today and

2519
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:50,400
I don't know

2520
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:52,192
It is like

2521
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:57,824
No I have no words for this this is so unacceptable

2522
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,872
I mean they are they are

2523
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,896
Desperate

2524
02:44:01,152 --> 02:44:01,664
And then

2525
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:02,944
Atlanta Braves

2526
02:44:03,712 --> 02:44:07,296
Hazel said hey buddy I appreciate you thanks for a bit my son. I said yes sir

2527
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:09,600
His lawyer went

2528
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:19,328
We're reaching out to them

2529
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:25,728
We're going to Connecticut or meet with them where's the port and what they did we're not going to accept Wesley's family somewhere not in Abby

2530
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:29,824
Part of the CIA New World Order propaganda operations not Sandy Hook

2531
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,104
What's the media control

2532
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:34,176
Job

2533
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:36,736
That's right God bless you

2534
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:42,368
So obviously when he says we're going to Connecticut that's about as other trial

2535
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:44,672
The Lafferty case

2536
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:46,208
I think

2537
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:51,328
That saying we won't be kept from these families

2538
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:53,632
Is something that

2539
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:55,680
Is

2540
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:57,984
So wrong

2541
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:03,360
Obviously the way he's trying to portray it as like

2542
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:09,760
Me and families are on the same side of his evil lawyers are trying to keep us apart because they're of the power that we could have together

2543
02:45:10,016 --> 02:45:13,600
Weather in this unity and love and all that switches nonsense

2544
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:21,792
The real world the place where the real world intersect with this b*******

2545
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:27,424
Is exactly the same kind of harassing behavior is encouraging those from the audience

2546
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,192
Because

2547
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:34,592
You know let's say that Scarlett or Neo or some of these other families don't behave in the way.

2548
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:36,896
If it you would expect based on Alex's rhetoric

2549
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:40,480
Well you should go talk to him why aren't they

2550
02:45:40,736 --> 02:45:45,088
If you're not allowed to while these lawyers are keeping them from you got to

2551
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:48,672
It lends itself towards encouraging harassment

2552
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:50,720
M i i

2553
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:55,328
Going to beyond anything that you know we talked about in terms of the lawsuit

2554
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,376
This response

2555
02:45:57,632 --> 02:45:58,144
Is

2556
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:02,496
I mean I agree with you as someone who has no legal background at all

2557
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:08,895
I think it should be a cause for another action

2558
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:11,967
Because for God

2559
02:46:12,223 --> 02:46:16,575
Creating a mountain so big he couldn't move it

2560
02:46:16,831 --> 02:46:22,207
Writing leave them the f*** alone on it and then dropping it on Alex's at I think you just

2561
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:22,975
I mean look

2562
02:46:23,231 --> 02:46:29,119
I don't want to use the kids terms but you got to take the L on this one Alex goddaughter just walk away

2563
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:30,143
Coronavirus

2564
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:36,543
Leave them alone just leave them alone I don't know what kind of bulshit game is doing to try and say

2565
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:38,079
Save face or create

2566
02:46:38,335 --> 02:46:42,943
The enemy is these lawyers and not the families and now I'm best friends with them

2567
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:43,711
But like

2568
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:48,319
That this is exploiting mean it's abusive it's disgusting

2569
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:52,415
And it's the kind of behavior that lends itself towards his audience

2570
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:55,487
Not behaving in ways that

2571
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:56,255
You'd walk

2572
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:57,279
I just

2573
02:46:57,535 --> 02:47:01,631
Digest I believe exactly that what he did was what he did

2574
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:05,215
I believe it wholeheartedly knew it was going to happen

2575
02:47:05,471 --> 02:47:07,263
That's exactly how it was going to go

2576
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:09,055
It wasn't going to be a

2577
02:47:09,311 --> 02:47:11,871
Hey listen I'm sorry we're never going to talk about Sandy Hook again

2578
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:15,455
It wasn't it wouldn't even have been just a quick one like Hey listen

2579
02:47:15,711 --> 02:47:18,527
Judgment turns out it was better than we hoped for

2580
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:21,087
Frankly I was f****** up

2581
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:27,487
Let's not talk about Sandy Hook ever again now they honestly put the words on the board bareboat

2582
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:34,143
Now I am going to actually instead does a great idea

2583
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:40,543
Going to go for the challenge mode of life

2584
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:46,943
Family experienced players only alright I guess if you want to go

2585
02:47:47,199 --> 02:47:51,551
I don't know

2586
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:58,719
Yeah I found this deeply upsetting inoffensive for

2587
02:47:58,975 --> 02:47:59,743
This episode

2588
02:47:59,999 --> 02:48:01,279
Because I don't

2589
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:07,935
No I don't know how else to like really put a button and stress like that is what Alex did after

2590
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:10,495
The compensatory damages were made after

2591
02:48:10,751 --> 02:48:13,823
And it sucks you'll never learn any lessons

2592
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:14,847
A spaceship

2593
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:20,735
Andy Murray will tomorrow with another episode rapping this baby up

2594
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:24,063
And also tomorrow you can find us on the majority that's true

2595
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:27,647
So that'll be noon Central 1 p.m. Eastern

2596
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:29,183
Yes

2597
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,975
I don't

2598
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:32,255
I can't do time laugh

2599
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:34,559
I can't I don't know why I said I couldn't

2600
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:40,191
Anyway what are you I'm tired man tired

2601
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:53,503
Remax Jordan but until then I'm Leo and easy access

2602
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:02,975
