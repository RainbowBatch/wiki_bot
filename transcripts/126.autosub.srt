00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
Disaster right now

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,320
You could have just flipped it to me this is off to a very combative

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Is there a headphone information

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,744
Hey Mambo

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Hey Mambo

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Alex Jones

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:44,544
Before we get today

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,896
2 couple dollars to the show

11
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
First of all

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
We appreciate it so much

13
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Now very much

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,928
All of our policy wonks and donors are special

15
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
In our hearts

16
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,560
But special

17
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
At the last minute

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
Do bump us over our January gold

19
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
The business and get this endgame documentary put together

20
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
California

21
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Someone sodomites

22
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
Thank you so much Andy from California

23
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
We appreciated

24
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Right it just gets better

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
See forget where it goes like we had one big blowout

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
Last dance contest

27
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
From on

28
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
They're not taking away our endgame sets for Less reference

29
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Okay just because I came in at the end let's not lose

30
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,480
And Tessa

31
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Yeah we got episode

32
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,440
Brett that scene

33
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
In Brokeback Mountain

34
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
It turns out that Alex Jones in the past

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
In the present

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
I just can't quit him

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Alright

38
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
So we're back to the front.

39
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
I'm still digging through listen to these months

40
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
But I'm realizing

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,664
It's going to be much more difficult to make a bow out of that

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Because like I said he repeats a lot

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,344
Their lot episodes that are like I'll just as last week's episode

44
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
The time it would take for us

45
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
To keep up with the show doing it like that would be

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
No time

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
And we are

48
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Here is

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,288
Is episodes

50
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Stupid

51
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
Georgia Lottery

52
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
What is this Alex

53
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
Ramona's cell phone computer at home

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,776
I believe it's the 2nd of February

55
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
28 drunk

56
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,712
Here is a picture of Alex Jones at his desk

57
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
I conveniently not hiding at all the highball ThyssenKrupp

58
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,232
This man is boozing pretty good during this episode

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Is a very exciting what is this

60
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
What are you talkin about

61
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Alex just go straight out and say

62
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
That's

63
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
Screamed

64
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,767
Indication that he's feeling

65
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
At the moment the pretense of this I believe is that he was going to record

66
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Video while I was drunk

67
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Get home

68
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
I don't know if Rob do anything

69
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Very close attention

70
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
You can hear the cameraman last

71
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
And that indicates to me that I think

72
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Partially Alex is trying to do a comedy piece

73
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
A little bit

74
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
In a second

75
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
Let's start

76
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
Well is there an endless preamble

77
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
No

78
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
It does

79
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:34,847
It does seem to go on forever it's a it's a 20-minute video that could have been for

80
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
Something like that

81
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Look there are parts

82
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
That are fun

83
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:48,671
Not the way he wants them to be more and more

84
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
Like I revealed one of my cards

85
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
This is embarrassing

86
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
Like to the point where whoever recorded this and post it

87
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
They're doing Alex Jones a very serious disservice

88
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
If it were me I'd be like

89
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Didn't really built anything

90
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,551
It wasn't nothing I just

91
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,367
I'd like recorded it and then was like the internet

92
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
This game winner

93
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,935
Send the internet with you

94
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
We've had a meeting about it

95
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
So I believe what's going on here is that Alex wanted to make a video about the memo release on Friday

96
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,407
And

97
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
It was shattering

98
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
World-changing information it was predicted

99
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
And that is that as soon as it's out it's nothing

100
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Until it comes out there is political

101
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
How are you

102
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
You can gain from it

103
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Insider source

104
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
Claimed it something else was the memo now the memos out and it's like he claimed to have already had them

105
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:19,551
Invalidates

106
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
So much of Alex Jones

107
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
It's like she Cannery about sources anyway Special Report

108
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
Sort of talks about the memo and then quickly skips on to another topic

109
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
Gentleman Batman

110
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Fisa memo

111
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Blueprints

112
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Activities

113
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Fisa warrant

114
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Warren

115
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Seriously

116
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
That's what everybody said about the memo so far right

117
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
About trying to overthrow the will of the text

118
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Pears

119
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,735
Is because you like taxes

120
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
I don't know why

121
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Process

122
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Text Sharon

123
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
What are pundits on MSN

124
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Calling

125
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Violence

Trump

127
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
True

128
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,351
Don't touch

129
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
Were there a little bit

130
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
Cuz he realizes Rodger Stone Nixon

131
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
Alex Alex

132
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Prosperity only Nixon could go to China

133
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
And bring back prosperity

134
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
Alex Jones would've been all over Nixon

135
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
There's absolutely no doubt about that

136
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,303
Anybody who has a authoritarianism

137
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
All over

138
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
That's what we're learning I think

139
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,703
Is that there was nobody who ever run for president for President

140
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
In Our Lifetime has been on air

141
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
A cruel authoritarian

142
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
Right right right right

143
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
Folksy accent behind so you're like so you can erode civil liberties that's

144
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:13,119
That's alright kooky little cat

145
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,447
Really anymore at all

146
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
To lay the groundwork

147
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
He's going to get into this clip from MSNBC

148
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
Where

149
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687

They take that compressor election

158
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
Break down the borders bringing their world government

159
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
It's just like a girl

Darso

161
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
So long

Slate

163
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
You're mixing metaphors

164
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,559
Clearly

165
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
We have

166
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
They just want a picture

167
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Clerk

168
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Marshalls

169
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
You could stop at Starbucks

170
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
He's about to take a big

171
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
American Recovery

172
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,511
This is unfortunately kind of rights that a gate the sky misspoke

173
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,143
Multiple people have been indicted

174
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,775
Guilt the gates

175
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
He's fighting

176
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Glenn and a Papadopoulos

177
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,039
I didn't know the Papadopoulos it's like guilty conviction

178
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Do you want to be like there was a fight

179
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
BFDI

180
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Able to vote that guy is technically correct

181
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,103
Play semantics games to make a little bit of hay on that because you know they didn't have full trial

182
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Clothes or anything like that

183
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
You know his

00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
I mean I've talked myself into

187
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,439
He's not right

188
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Indications and like I guess it hasn't gone through yet

189
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
It looks like that

190
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
It's probably gone

191
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Yeah that would make three

192
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
You should absolutely do that

193
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,175
Who knows what's going to happen with that pick situation

194
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
What are these

195
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
I don't know man

196
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Wild wild stuff

197
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
It is

198
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,095
To know that this is the government we deserve what America has come into it like look

199
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Idiot

200
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Here you go

201
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
Idiots run the Asylum now and we're all like

202
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
F***

203
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
They're not good at that but you know you know what

204
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
What super telling to me is that like

205
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
Pretty much

206
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
On board with Trump

207
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
For the most part

208
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
If it wasn't

209
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Except for Shep Smith

210
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
Has become

211
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Heroic for being like

212
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Hold on reality

213
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,839
You know what I'm saying is if it wasn't

214
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Ratings advantageous

215
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,031
That wouldn't be probably where they go

216
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Curious version of

217
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Support

218
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
For this

219
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Crumbly Administration is Alex Jones

220
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,783
And when you look line denial then when you look at it like that he's a guy who's

221
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,647
Perfectly happy to get wasted and recorded 20-minute video of you

222
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
This is great

223
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
That should tell you something running distraction for you is wasted

224
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Pizza

225
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
Magic State of Affairs if that's your propaganda

226
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
New Yorker without

227
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
Into whether or not he was on record like

228
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Comedy

229
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
But one that's going to get us all killed it's

230
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
Well we got to go some way might as well be comical

231
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
Might as well be hilarious clip Alex

232
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
Get back to

233
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
It's not a lie that you have been convicted

234
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:10,079
That was going to be the one thing I gave him credit for

235
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Already been convicted

236
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
Trump is clearly on by Putin

237
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Christopher Walken

238
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
I know he's not clearly

239
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,223
You can't keep a hold of it it it it's a slippery impression

240
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,671
PV football player

241
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
We have

242
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
That's not true

243
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,727
Clearly this man is

244
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,775
Futuristic Clueless

245
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
Literally possums coming out his ass

246
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,919
Literally

247
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
Okay

248
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Picture

249
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
Still going

250
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
Monkey

251
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Popcorn

252
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
They come back from break

253
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,551
So you start to quit.

254
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
That was the moment

255
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
His impression just slid squarely into

256
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Clown

257
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
I don't give a

258
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
He's f****** wasted

259
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,399
When he started doing that about halfway through his like

260
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
Cut it right here

261
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Put it on the internet this

262
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
To f****** go right

263
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,127
Raise the bar still further

264
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
And we got

265
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
The pivot man from the

266
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,599
It the clown by reference to the Nigerian state

267
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
He got tricked by that

268
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
He's so obsessed with it

269
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
It has to be it has to be about himself

270
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Everything is about him

271
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
I think that there's no other way to look at it

272
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Like

273
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
I lost my

274
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
My shirt

275
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
Disease

276
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,615
They said President Obama

277
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
New new pet

278
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Turn

279
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
By the night

280
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
You think that's what made him go crazy he's a Nigerian scammer

281
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Okay

282
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
You're not going to get this Nigerian

283
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
But

284
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
You're a great scammer to

285
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,911
Game recognize game

286
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,799
We're trying to get into the supplement Market on your way

287
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
For a long time I've been trying to figure out is like

288
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,431
Good luck you will Forza very little

289
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,783
I've been trying to figure out those various like sort of pivot Points

290
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
If you look through history of Alex Jones

291
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
The terms as like

292
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
Find something weird

293
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,183
A I am that might have been one of them

294
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
Lexia prop is one of them at some point 3813e started selling supplements

295
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:50,751
That's clearly another one but you look back further you got tricked by the Nigerian

296
00:18:54,335 --> 00:19:00,479
Actually I think you just watch the movie Coming to America and he was like oh that's like being tricked by the Nigerian scammers

297
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:06,623
Also to the chat room I know that the clowns name Pennywise but Alex always calls him It the clown

298
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,743
A daughter of who his naming conventions Iceland

299
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
So if Preston was that you're wrong

300
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
Clearly the Russian Salinas electro-pop top officials

301
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
We have

302
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Now we'll give this present

303
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
Permission

304
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,935
Rosenstein

305
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Chords

306
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,663
Gingivitis

307
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
Who's this guy

308
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,183
American call me if you want

309
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,679
What was unemployment

310
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
Rosenstein

311
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
BFDI

312
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,295
Wait was he

313
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
I don't know this character is

314
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,463
Very difficult to pin down although I do know

315
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,303
From the literal end of this episode

316
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
I know what the character is

317
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Does Alex Jones

318
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Seaside Park

319
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,775
I'm not Alex Jones I'm black

320
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,855
Rod Rosenstein Hillary operative blah blah blah that's

321
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,720
It's really funny to me that about all of these like

322
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Economic benchmarks that

323
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Trampas

324
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Achieving all of it if you look at

325
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Continuation

326
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,264
You recorded this

327
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
That's when the Dow Jones

328
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,176
No like 626 points

329
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,760
Oh there it is the mark of the beast

330
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:49,696
So when Alex is like talking about the market doing really well there's a reason to believe that

331
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
Means possible who knows what's going to happen

332
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
The biggest fall since

333
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
2008 or whatever since brexit

334
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:02,496
Yeah so I don't know all those arguments or to fall flat

335
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Who cares

336
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
That's an interesting point this is it this is an important point

337
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
I don't care

338
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
About the stock market

339
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,272
I don't want to hear about the stock market ever it doesn't matter

340
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
It doesn't matter

341
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,648
It's not it doesn't change the stock market has gone up for

342
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
For how long in a row

343
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Has anybody's Act

344
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Virtual wages

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Some people

346
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,656
Billionaires Walmart

347
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Tricks

348
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
You're being

349
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Strict Walmart work

350
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
Use the thousand dollars that gave you

351
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,664
For my union and then f****** get real job

352
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,808
I know

353
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
Would come down at Asner

354
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,512
And we need to get off the f****** gold standard

355
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,584
Alex lays out the exact kind of danger that were in

356
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Care about the stalker

357
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
I understand and uses

358
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,616
Oh this is proof that we're still doing good

359
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,712
It's just as frustrating to me is whatever they talked about it instead all this is proof

360
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
We're doing bad or whatever the

361
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
It's the fact that

362
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
By god dammit

363
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Fair enough

364
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,464
I don't know what to address in that ramps on the lettuce

365
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
I would like to doesn't mean

366
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,888
Just a pivot away from your

367
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
I don't have anything to add

368
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Hillary operative

369
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Israeli Talent

370
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Because that

371
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Indicates

372
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Piano

373
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
I think a lot of people in this world

374
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,392
Everyone who is a trump operative

375
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Right

376
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
And that that's how everything works

377
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,560
Person who leads democratic

378
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,352
You know X Y or Z

379
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,936
Figure I got Obama operative independent agent

380
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Everybody is always working under me

381
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,824
And that means that there's clear

382
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
Divisions in sides and it's like an army

383
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
So if you have somebody who goes against

384
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
Then they are not operating in their own best interest or or what they feel like they larger interest if it's there

385
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
Reason

386
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Treason

387
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Rosa

388
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
Pretty much

389
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,056
Mueller is a republican itself

390
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,848
A Republican

391
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,176
It seems like it that's why Alex Jones is the perfect person to be the

392
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
LakePoint man for this propaganda

393
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,272
Because he doesn't give a s*** about

394
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,064
Democrats or Republicans

395
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Kind actually does

396
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
But he's able to say any Republican I don't like

397
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
They're just globalist

398
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,512
Democrats are there's a couple of good Republicans

399
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
No good Democrat

400
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,448
Lump in the Republican with a Democrat

401
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
About the danger

402
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Let's do it

403
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
Take tolls

404
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Donuts

405
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
Alexa

406
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Blueberry loquacious made man

407
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
This is

408
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
How did you still try to make this work

409
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
This is right around when I was like

410
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
This is embarrassing

411
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Holyshit

412
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
S***

413
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,072
Like this is something that I would be like

414
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,472
There's a video making millions of dollars B propaganda

415
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
Someone's Secret

416
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,568
I think of me rambling

417
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
Terrible Mafia pressure

418
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Dude

419
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
Hush money time

420
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
Now that Alex

421
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
Is the perfect man is because

422
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
You can't embarrass

423
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
You don't win

424
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:40,512
Well I think it would be embarrassing what eventually when he goes to rehab

425
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
Help

426
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Hiccup someone my maker

427
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
8180

428
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Crazy to live

429
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Anyway

430
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Like I said

431
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
During that clip that was when I was like

432
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,176
Impression Trails out

433
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,272
That sort of thing I was like this is this

434
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,368
Is really unfortunate situation

435
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
This is where I was like

436
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Holyshit

437
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
This is a mic.

438
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912
Why are you doing that

439
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:23,008
I feel like I said he was drunk

440
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312
Cuz I wasn't really paying attention to the table

441
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,384
Glass cook number 10

442
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
I'm tired

443
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,264
MSNBC

444
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,808
Lightning suck if you want

445
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
Future American

446
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Tavares msnbc's Union

447
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
Going to take you make you all along we gotta run your life

448
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,240
American flag

449
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
America first

450
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,400
Excuse me

451
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,800
Holyshit glimpse of like the real Alex Jones

452
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
Angry angry I see myself you're a little more eloquent

453
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Get funky

454
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Knox

455
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Character

456
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,304
That's the real you know I think

457
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
To some extent by the

458
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
Excuse me if you realize it

459
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
Pasteboard czars dafuq

460
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,968
Who gives a s*** no to be fairy didn't put her in that

461
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:45,856
Is anything wrong

462
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
V

463
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,072
Christian point of view would not be fine with any

464
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
Regardless

465
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,984
What's the talk about like the arosia no values and stuff like that

466
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,776
Look no further

467
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,872
Like think about that think about how you talked about how good the globalist

468
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
Erode the family and religion and all that stuff

469
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Look at what he's doing

470
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:18,624
Looking with looking to have

471
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
I don't know like three wives

472
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
You know

473
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,536
They want you to have multiple children

474
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:28,864
And they want you to get divorced multiple times

475
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
Let me tell you something about interest

476
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
You charge

477
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Okay

478
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,592
The s*** okay the other than global

479
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,944
Maintaining a kind of faithfulness to your spouse

480
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Globalist hate that

481
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
So then you definitely don't want that

482
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
They want

483
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,696
They want to make sure that everybody's treated don't want a president who doesn't

484
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,232
Give people fairness

485
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:01,120
They want people to be on the up-and-up

486
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
They want somebody who cares about them and their issues somebody breaks the f****** first rule of Jesus's

487
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Follow me in the f******

488
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:13,920
It's easier for a rich man to get through the f****** eye of a needle anyways

489
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Christian president

490
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
He's the one

491
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
From the top do that again but in a mafia

492
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
So this f****** guy also has a weird stereotypical Jew

493
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
It's going to slide into a little bit.

494
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,912
That comes with the play

495
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,312
He's too drunk to keep his oppression scrape there is no doubt about that but in the talks about the economics

496
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:47,712
About Brooklyn hold on hold on

497
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:53,088
Trump is so great about

498
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Recognized

499
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,904
Is being recorded on the

500
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,464
Literal day that the stock market crashed

501
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
It hasn't years

502
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
Frightening

503
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:21,248
Billions

504
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
Travolta

505
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,464
Again there at the end is it

506
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,304
You remember that video that went around a David Hasselhoff trying to eat a cheeseburger

507
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,888
Propaganda version of that to me

508
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
This is where Alex Jones daughters

509
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,728
Should show him this video if you like

510
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
You need help

511
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
F****** help

512
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
You're a major public figure you can't do this stuff

513
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,896
This is this

514
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,456
Underlies and and hurt

515
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Your credibility

516
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,368
Another word for the Baywatch remake

517
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,976
They were never going to put you up because

518
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
S***-faced on air

519
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
Absolutely

520
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
You need to lose 40 lb

521
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
To take more supermodel

522
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,800
No doubt about that

523
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,480
Is more or less just sacraments of the 20 minutes

524
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Cuz he's I like to give you a full picture of rain

525
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,696
Text keep pivots from this economic nonsense

526
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,256
Into screaming about his perceived victimhood

527
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:24,896
You son of a b****

528
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:42,560
Vista impression starting to sound familiar

529
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:55,616
Conspiracies and propaganda

530
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:04,576
Real real quick at least no one else

531
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,928
Call Toys R Us

532
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
But unclear

533
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
Connection with the Kremlin

534
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
You did say on your show that you have

535
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Intelligent

536
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,872
But also he's misrepresenting this Wall Street Journal article

537
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Come down

538
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
What they're suggesting

539
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
I'm not sure actually a hundred percent

540
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,696
Having suggested videos for things like Alex

541
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
Two more credible content

542
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
That explains what he's lying

543
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,656
So you can watch the sidebar there be like

544
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,936
What this is really about

545
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
That sort of thing

546
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
That's effective

547
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,568
But it's not censorship it's more like

548
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,128
People actually trying to take a proactive stance

549
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Against your b*******

550
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,432
Relics

551
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Ethan

552
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Silencing

553
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,528
Free Speech it's just letting people know

554
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
This person is f****** lying to

555
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
That's that's next week

556
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,352
There's nothing to do with the argument has nothing to do with free speech

557
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Or the 1st Amendment

558
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
Sing like that the argument is

559
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,496
Why aren't you letting me live in the world

560
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
Brightright

561
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:34,688
And its people into believing my s*** for this long

562
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,344
If you are one of the Alex Jones listeners you don't want a video coming up that says

563
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
You believe is right

564
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
While they're watching Alex Jones

565
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
What they would say

566
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Think is a

567
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
Literal example of why Alex

568
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,056
Is right on the side

569
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,592
And you just have like

570
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
These fact-checking sites

571
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
Fact-checking videos

572
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,968
Some stuff like that whatever

573
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Or the new bad guy

574
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,648
Cousin Alex Jones has had them trying to take out

575
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,280
Snopes and PolitiFact

576
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,816
And stuff like that

577
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,376
All you're mad about is if they actually document

578
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
That's all that's going on

579
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,616
Alex Jones Show

580
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Bring it down

581
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
See this video over here to the right of me

582
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
That thing's bulshit alright

583
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
MSNBC or whatever the f*** it is over there

584
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:56,608
It does introduce possibility for us to get a job

585
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
If someone needs to make those videos

586
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Anyway

587
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Or if somebody would just like

588
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,824
Two dedicated trolls 2

589
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:12,480
Put videos right next to his on a suggested video for them for YouTube I got to figure

590
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Yeah that's

591
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,648
Alex Jones YouTube coming for you

592
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Stop the jobs coming back

593
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,640
That's how you dirty shut the freak speak dog

594
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:48,832
We're getting into Lennie from Of Mice and Men

595
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,560
So proceed victimhood clip

596
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
Legitimately lost

597
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,216
The character doesn't make sense anymore we started

598
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,264
Welfare with the anymore

599
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
He started in a mafia thing switch to Pennywise

600
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272
Almost

601
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,344
A vested interest in mocking people who sound Jewish

602
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Next

603
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
That's not true

604
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,720
You got to go in there and say we're going to kill him on TV

605
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
America almost

606
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
Chinese money

607
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Washington Post

608
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
Hugo bully America

609
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
Show me picture of

610
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Socialism

611
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,808
Google Play

612
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
So

613
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
What you got

614
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
This is actually a new College course that auntie

615
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
Teaching

616
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Professorship at the U of U of I C

617
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
And

618
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
EDD

619
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
I wish I had said that

620
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
U of I Champaign

621
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
It is just

622
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
Re listening to that clip

623
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Over and over and over again

624
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,976
And if you can figure out

625
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,816
How his brain went from a to

626
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
Alphanumeric over there if you just

627
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
PEMDAS

628
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,848
Exercise for a college course exegesis

629
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,895
Trying to figure out from the tech

630
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,479
It would be more riddling event decoding the Dead

631
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
What in the

632
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
That sounds terrible

633
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,023
At least it is impression you can laugh at it but all the page pool boy

634
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,839
I almost wanted to put up like

635
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,375
On the wall like

636
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:19,775
Pictures of his idea tie string from what it like a serial killer

637
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Your killer just being like

638
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
How did we get

639
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
From here to hear what is going on here connected and why is he sounding like bulldog

640
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
Dogs Go To Heaven

641
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
Spoiler alert none of it makes sense

642
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,087
So none of it's real

643
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
How dare you

644
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,559
You know what he's talking about there with the Chinese funding

645
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Answers

646
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,095
No

647
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:48,959
A little while back the story came out I believe it was in Politico about

648
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
These things called Confucius and

649
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Institutes

650
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,567
That have been started to be

651
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,103
Popping up in

652
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:02,015
Right there's a number of them that have I think it's like 100 universities in the United States currently have

653
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
Confucius

654
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
Institute at them

655
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,879
Actually a little bit of a murky

656
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Territory

657
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,743
And that they are our bodies that are sanctioned on campuses

658
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
And what they do is they help with

659
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,375
Teaching about Chinese culture and language

660
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,191
Which is a great service to LA

661
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,983
Universities that don't have the resources

662
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
For those sorts

663
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
The classes particularly

664
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
The language stop

665
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:30,431
Does all the funding eventually shaved back into a place

666
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Swear they

667
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Influence

668
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
A little bit extra

669
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
22R tides

670
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,047
To like a propaganda wing of the Chinese government Taiwan is a part of

671
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,863
China Tibet is

672
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
Performance

673
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:57,055
I don't feel great about either but they're not like

674
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,919
Funding the university it's at these universities have allowed them to operate

675
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,991
Little piece of the University

676
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:10,879
Right not like they've taken over the University or the Communist Chinese or even funding the University

677
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
Is that there are these cultural centers

678
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
That are all

679
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,023
Connected which again

680
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:23,423
Automatically problem with my issue has nothing to do with the government

681
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
It is

682
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
It is just like if you were reading a block or so

683
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Something like that

684
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,847
You should have sponsored content

685
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Clearly label

686
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Right

687
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,015
So if you're getting a

688
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,063
That's awesome but there should also be

689
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
Sponsored content

690
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,671
From people who want to make sure you only know their picture

691
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
Even as innocuous as Justine

692
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Language

693
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,351
May seem their opportunities for you to eat

694
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,887
Confused

695
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:01,055
Lance Stephenson

696
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:05,407
Back in Mandarin

697
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,783
I think that that's something that probably merits a much larger conversation

698
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,087
But it's not with Alex Jones is presented

699
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,439
All of the universities are funded by the communist Chinese

700
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
That's not true at all

701
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,767
Most of them

702
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,559
Major universities don't have

703
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,863
Kind of smaller colleges

704
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
Is there a bit embarrassed

705
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,519
Universities that I remember in this articles

706
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
Specifically reference through like

707
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
See

708
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,127
University of Iowa

709
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
George Washing

710
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
St.Louis

711
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
There aren't

712
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
There are

713
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,343
I think it's mostly in smaller State schools and smaller

714
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Famously George

715
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,511
What you doing

716
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,095
Right there's a lot of

717
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,679
Lexus

718
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,495
Erschools cuz they already have Chinese culture Department

719
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
And they already have Chinese

720
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
To offer those courses

721
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
Where is the

722
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:12,991
Assertive stick

723
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,063
Advertising

724
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Right right

725
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,951
Attached of carrot is

726
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,071
Right because of that I'm against it but I kind of understand why

727
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Exist

728
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,655
I think we need to have another not profit

729
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679
If it was

730
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Independence

731
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
Source of funding going around saying

732
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Here we need more people to teach

733
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
Chinese language in Kyle

734
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
That's great

735
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
If it is

736
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Gerbils

737
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
1

738
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:53,439
Chinese propaganda is he still alive

739
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
3

740
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
That bad

741
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
Yeah and it's bad

742
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
I've seen is that sort of

743
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,727
The point of our podcast

744
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
In good

745
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Since being favored of the

746
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Confucius Institute

747
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
I see the bigger picture of them

748
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
And I know that it's not

749
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:19,039
Really for me to decide whether they're good or bad I don't have enough information

750
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
The people should be talking about it and I think that

751
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,647
Sponsored content and like I said

752
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,511
Has just recently come out in terms of reporting on it in Politico

753
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
I think that the conversation will grow over time

754
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,375
As more information is found out about

755
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,935
These places Alex Jones

756
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
F****** stupid

757
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,007
Is Nex-Tech

758
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
Is even worse

759
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:59,743
How do you tell if a chicken

760
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Just like Mom Bismarck said

761
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,831
First of all that's not the quote

762
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:29,951
It is until he said you suck

763
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:36,351
It's kind of a tell whenever you're like God loves America and Americans children's

764
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
The drunks you fox

765
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Your

766
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
Two of those

767
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
Like the third

768
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:48,127
This mentality though

769
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
To justify their

770
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Ignorance

771
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:58,623
I want to talk about more is that this idea

772
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,183
Things that he doesn't like or that he disagrees with

773
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Anime

774
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
Cuz we only have to go back about a week

775
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,423
CNN fake news has been arrested after allegedly

776
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
Threatened to kill the Network's employees

777
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
Michigan management arrest

778
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,847
For allegedly threatening to carry out a mass shooting at CNN's Atlanta headquarters

779
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,663
A series of possible phone calls earlier this month

780
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Operators

781
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,527
In 22 separate phone calls on January 9th

782
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,087
Contempt in which he allegedly called the networks fake news

783
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,135
And threaten CNN employees of violence

784
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
CBS affiliate w

785
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
GCL TV reported

786
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Quote I'm coming

787
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,767
The gun you all down

788
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
He reportedly said

789
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,143
Quote I'm smarter than you more powerful than you I have more guns than you more manpower

790
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
Your cast is about to

791
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
Gunned down in a matter of hours

792
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,799
I'm coming to Georgia right now to the CNN headquarters to f***

793
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
Gun every single last one of

794
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
So you got arrested

795
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:59,039
Famous quotes

796
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,343
That could be improved by adding you fux

797
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Okay

798
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
Ich bin ein Berliner you fox

799
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,119
I understand

800
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
You fux

801
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
I'm not a crook

802
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
That would just do presidential quote so we could go we go all over the place

803
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,647
You just put your lips together and blow you f***

804
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
Sophie

805
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,327
It's one thing

806
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
To be concerned

807
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
With

808
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
To do a better job which I think we both agree with

809
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Yellow heartedly

810
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,847
But it's another thing to be like these people are the f****** anime

811
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
Does even as much as we hate Alex Jones

812
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,223
In this show

813
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
Major problem

814
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
But no-one should f******

815
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,927
No maybe you scream about it but

816
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
Character

817
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,839
Let's political politically

818
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Bright

819
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,423
You know like that that mentality leads

820
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
It's just stuff like that guy going

821
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
The shoot up

822
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,519
Aspiring

823
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:29,407
Alex Alex exemplifies the enemy and that is not

824
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,479
Person it is

825
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
The

826
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Bring

827
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,647
Railing against railing against

828
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
Is the people who take advantage

829
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Of this

830
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,279
Fly in the human

831
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Mines

832
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
Processing

833
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
Yeah that's really we're going

834
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
Send we'd like to

835
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,191
Like there should be a bug patch

836
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
First human

837
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,615
Download a patch processing system to get them past all of this s***

838
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Free virus software

839
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:07,039
We're talking about just has too many pop-ups on their browser

840
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:12,415
Click on weird side ads

841
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:18,815
Navigate to Mozilla or whatever

842
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
Everything is going so slow

843
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
But if the same time like

844
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
I would never call

845
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,079
Alex Jones's listeners or Alex

846
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Anime

847
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
Because

848
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
That brain virus

849
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,199
They were describing and talking about

850
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
In the case of Alex

851
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,503
I think it's too far gone

852
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
Personally

853
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,903
But anyone who believes believes

854
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Stuff

855
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:50,303
They have the potential to get over it over and over again the people

856
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,863
Are much more malleable than we think

857
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
You believe this stuff you're stuck there

858
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,335
They are motivated to work are they can change

859
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
Quite easily

860
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,151
I believe that

861
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,967
Even if these people are f******

862
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,991
Alex

863
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
Is f****** stupid

864
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,087
And he's advocating for stupidity I still

865
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
Don't

866
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
Harbor Lights

867
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,183
You're the anime you need to work harder

868
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:20,767
That's what I would say you need to look more into the things you believe

869
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,559
Right because they're f******

870
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
Kingdom

871
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
If I come dumb

872
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,703
Maybe some of this is me projecting how much research I've been doing

873
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:35,359
Easily pick a part of their narratives about like why he believes there's a new world order to begin with

874
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,383
That sort of stuff is he

875
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Stupid

876
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,711
Anybody who actually reads the

877
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Site

878
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Wouldn't

879
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Believe him

880
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,647
Yeah but didn't exist at the same time I also think that

881
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
What we're fighting

882
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,463
Alex

883
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Is not

884
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
Jet

885
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Stupidity

886
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,119
So much as it is his brain operates

887
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
A nonlinear

888
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
If you

889
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,359
If you followed along with his

890
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,711
Laundry list

891
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Really is just laundry

892
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,159
If you follow along with that you see that what is really going on is if you were to go up to him with all of this

893
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
Look into this further

894
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Here's another reference

895
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
He's just going to bounce on

896
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,047
Say OK Google

897
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Look into that

898
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
He's going to bounce on the next

899
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
A focusing on anything

900
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,215
Long enough

901
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
To get to that point

902
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
Santino's

903
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,823
So he's like a perfect storm of

904
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,615
Dumb enough to be you

905
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
Virus

906
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:45,759
Mentally incapable of focusing long enough well

907
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Kind of antenna

908
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
National because

909
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,927
I think on some level he knows that his evidence

910
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
Does Quincy

911
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:58,303
And the tactic of jumping around from one topic to the next is his way of never really having

912
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,095
Stand behind one of them

913
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
Because if

914
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,959
He did believe like let's say Oklahoma City was really legitimately fake

915
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,495
Yeah he could dedicate his

916
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Tire life

917
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
The proving that

918
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,079
If he believes he has proof

919
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
Then that would be

920
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Major

921
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
That would be very big

922
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,479
If you would do that

923
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,783
Instead of jumping around to XYZ

924
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,343
ABCDEFG f****** nonsense.

925
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Distraction narrative

926
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:26,207
If he has the goal he sets out

927
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
To do

928
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,255
You know I'm saying so like

929
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,071
Leave the distraction to jumping around

930
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
From thread

931
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,863
The thread

932
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
It's his way of never having to

933
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Come to Jesus

934
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
And recognize the fact

935
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Get the things that

936
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
You saying

937
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,871
I mean it's at the same time

938
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
It's a question of

939
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
Pathology versus responsibility

940
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Like-like to me

941
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,575
I don't feel like he is

942
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,135
Capable of that because of a pathology

943
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,975
Because it is a

944
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,399
It is like alcoholism play the part of his

945
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
But it is it is more with the way that his brain Acts

946
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,543
Functions because when you say you know

947
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,335
You could dedicate your whole life

948
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
The proving that

949
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
The OKC

950
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Saying what he would say to you

951
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:24,319
So why would I I've got other things too also

952
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,367
Rolex

953
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
The work is done

954
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
It wasn't even hard

955
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:33,535
It was even hard to look into this and disprove just a service

956
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
A long time ago

957
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
Let's move on

958
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
Because the next

959
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Sport Clips that I have

960
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
I have no idea what's going on in them

961
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
Alright baby just have various titles

962
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,687
This is what he's talking about

963
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,647
Where's the nearby

964
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,207
What is ahead

965
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,487
Technician

966
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:08,095
Information

967
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,143
Classified info

968
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
I'm going to get there fake Warren

969
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,591
But they denied they did it prove

970
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
Nelson riddle episode Concerta

971
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Security

972
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
That is

973
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Time

974
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,855
Brachytherapy after my weiner out there

975
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,695
That's a very serious question

976
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,511
Is there an FBI

977
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,327
I think it's probably a fairly

978
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,911
Majestic Way for him to end this

979
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
You suck cuz I'm a girl auntie

980
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,311
TV and I don't have any f****** credentials to be here

981
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
That's kind of what are you getting

982
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
That was a Great Bernese

983
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,919
Thank you thank you

984
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
You know I don't know

985
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,087
MSNBC anchor probably

986
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:05,183
Pretty decent point that all just people who a railing on abuses of fisa court

987
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,071
It's still all voted 4702 to barre3 past

988
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
A little while ago

989
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
Nonsensical

990
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
With the

991
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:24,127
Wikileaks ignore all the crimes they committed like

992
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:30,527
How to tighten that up

993
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:35,647
Emails but what you actually said is people ignore the crimes WikiLeaks

994
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:40,255
Just an interesting much more interesting conversation

995
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,047
Right

996
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,119
Beyond all of the dumb s*** that he said which was

997
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
Staggering

998
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Even

999
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
In such a short. Of time

1000
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,543
There are a couple of very good points there insofar as

1001
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,847
You want to

1002
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Say like

1003
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,431
They had to go to it every 90 days

1004
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,479
New information

1005
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,551
At the same time part of what Snowden released

1006
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
Prove that the fisa court is essentially a rubber stamp

1007
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,535
Whenever is Snowden released information

1008
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
They'd only turn down like three out of the

1009
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,143
Thousands upon thousands of warrants

1010
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,167
The day

1011
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,959
That's a good point

1012
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:27,359
I would respect that I don't think that the fisa court is

1013
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
When you're saying that

1014
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Dear

1015
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:33,247
Do you need to be very careful because just the idea that they turn down

1016
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
3 out of 1,000 or whatever

1017
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,879
Doesn't mean that the other 997 let's say it's

1018
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Does Princeton

1019
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Word

1020
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,463
Cases where it was legitimate

1021
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,023
The idea of it being a rubber stamp

1022
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Court is

1023
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
The perception that you can have

1024
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:52,191
But that doesn't meet you have no idea what those other cases where neither does Alex

1025
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,055
That's a fair point all of those cases that

1026
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,383
The warrants got issues

1027
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,455
Could have been things where they were very Meredith

1028
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:09,599
Any evidence was there to look into some of the cases that were rubber stamp

1029
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,415
Can do now that like what released

1030
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,951
And you find it

1031
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,023
A lot of those fights that warrants a lot of the spices

1032
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:20,095
Fight the warrants came after the FBI

1033
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
Legitimately setup entrapment

1034
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
Okay somebody who they felt might be a candidate for

1035
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,431
And then they listened in on their conversation

1036
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,479
Trying to roll them up

1037
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
To get to someone higher

1038
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,159
Is pretty f***** up

1039
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Collar

1040
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,327
That's what they were trying to do they were trying to show that the terrorism enforcement was working

1041
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,887
Terrorist they created terrorist

1042
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,447
I'm going to bed first of all I did

1043
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,543
Disagree with

1044
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
I disagree with that wholeheartedly

1045
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
But if I were someone who was

1046
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Trying to figure out

1047
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
How to penetrate

1048
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,479
Higher Networks

1049
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,527
I don't know what other strategy I would

1050
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,855
You don't I'm saying I'm not saying it's right and I'm against

1051
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
Time I understand

1052
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Thinking that leads

1053
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Intuit

1054
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Right

1055
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
Do you want me to you

1056
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
The

1057
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
I get what you're saying I get what you're trying to say there and I think you're misunderstanding what it was they are doing

1058
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
As opposed to

1059
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,751
Like the idea that you have

1060
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,567
Hey what you do is you find somebody low-level

1061
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,175
Monitor that isn't inclined

1062
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,967
You turned him into a terrorist

1063
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,039
And then they end up

1064
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,319
Communicating with someone

1065
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,879
Who is more legit

1066
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,671
That is

1067
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,207
Bad tactic

1068
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,839
It's very unreliable one and you're not going to get good information out of that but I never cared

1069
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,911
That's far less evil than what they were doing which was

1070
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Closing the loop

1071
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,775
Like the higher ticket I was going to talk to

1072
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,567
Was also an FBI

1073
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
Like they were just in traffic

1074
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,151
Like legitimately

1075
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
Committing crimes

1076
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
To make it look like they were catching

1077
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
People committing cry

1078
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
And that's what a lot of is not a lot of

1079
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Some of the fisa warrant

1080
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,207
So many of those by two warrants have been just

1081
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
Sweet we can do that

1082
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,119
Lego

1083
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
Problematic

1084
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,471
Problematic problematic

1085
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,799
Little murkier than that

1086
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:43,199
I think they were probably like I'm not sitting here saying like let's trust Authority implicitly or anything like that but I

1087
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,271
I think the picture is a little more complicated than

1088
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,319
Then your position and Alex

1089
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,647
No means am I trying to say that it is uncomplicated

1090
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,535
My point though is I would rather we were on a healthy

1091
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,583
Healthy suspicion of

1092
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,607
Secretive

1093
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
Tribunal Court

1094
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:08,031
That can justify warrantless version is much more healthy

1095
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,311
Skepticism

1096
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,455
Well I also I also kind of agree with him as far as Democrats having a fetish for the FBI in the CIA

1097
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:19,039
Like we should not

1098
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:30,815
Belike we should undermine faith in our public system I'm saying that our public system

1099
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,143
Workforce has already been laid

1100
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:40,543
Great

1101
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,847
Jesus

1102
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
No there is

1103
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:49,503
There is absolutely but murdered

1104
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
Okay I'm going to trust Muller

1105
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:56,159
Because he probably helped murder Fred Hampton

1106
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
Look I agree with you there tremendous abuses that have been carried out by the intelligence community

1107
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,399
Believe the answer to that is some sort of oversight

1108
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
Some sort of reform within the process

1109
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,007
As opposed to outright.

1110
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,335
Just dropped an outright demonization of the people

1111
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:20,735
Who took just because you have the examples and I'm not saying it's just one there are many but like Fred

1112
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:27,135
That doesn't mean that there isn't other a very important work and it's done by people

1113
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,415
Within those organization

1114
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
I don't know

1115
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
I think reform

1116
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,303
I think civilian oversight

1117
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
To some extent

1118
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
Is Meredith

1119
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,447
Could be away some of that could be implemented

1120
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:45,055
But I don't know how you doing

1121
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
Solution-based

1122
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,151
I agree

1123
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,455
That is where you and I agree

1124
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
I'm guessing Alex

1125
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,087
This point of view on how to solve those abuses is not the sea

1126
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,231
No he wants from the chat room Vietnam

1127
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,447
It looks like

1128
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:18,079
Galaxy

1129
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:22,943
Train that Amtrak Collision being false flag

1130
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
You can

1131
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,271
That's an interesting thing

1132
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,319
Why is Mueller has to know

1133
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
That

1134
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,391
Vietnam lasted

1135
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,695
How many years longer

1136
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
Just because Nixon wanted to

1137
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
Win re-election

1138
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
Write like

1139
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
You can't be

1140
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,631
Be the FBI director not know that

1141
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Right

1142
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,751
So he lost many years of his life to Vietnam

1143
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,567
And yet is still a republican on down the road

1144
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,103
That

1145
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,431
Yeah I don't know I don't unpack it looks

1146
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,223
The bottom

1147
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:02,111
Probably this

1148
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:17,215
You think he'll take care of the country Integra future or this stuff suits

1149
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:32,575
I want to know what the

1150
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
Rosenstein work for Hillary

1151
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
Present route

1152
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,719
I don't know

1153
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,767
President Roosevelt believe

1154
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:17,375
Stupid praetorian guard kind of thing you're saying about Mueller

1155
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,703
Couple months back

1156
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,263
All this

1157
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
I don't know man

1158
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,127
Information

1159
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,919
Comes out

1160
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Itself look

1161
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
Kind of embarrassing cuz

1162
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,527
The investigation.

1163
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,111
Predicated on the Steele dossier at all

1164
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Seems like

1165
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
There were other things

1166
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
The triggered it

1167
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,207
From

1168
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:48,607
Things that Carter page public Papadopoulos

1169
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Email like they might

1170
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,471
It had more to do with the beginnings of it

1171
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
And then

1172
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,567
The Steele dossier got involved I'm not sure though

1173
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,871
I think a lot of this will play out in coming months

1174
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,503
It seems as though even with what they

1175
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,551
Even with what's been called like that

1176
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,599
Redacting herb you know

1177
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,207
Cutting out a lot of the omitting a lot of information they would have provided more contacts

1178
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:19,071
It still seems like it justifies them spying on Trump campaign pretty solid

1179
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
What do you mean

1180
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,935
It goes through a lot of different things in your leg

1181
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:28,031
This would only be unreasonable if you already sis

1182
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
Expected

1183
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,591
A conspiracy to take down

1184
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,431
Like oh yeah yeah yeah

1185
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,455
Right right

1186
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,783
If you become president

1187
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,831
No matter what side you're on your life

1188
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,623
Oh yeah you should probably about

1189
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,743
Probably a good idea but if you're already convinced that Trump is

1190
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
Under conspiracy

1191
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:55,423
What's the the sort of track has been laid by the axis of the world and what have you

1192
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,567
Here's another ramble I don't know what this is about I have no idea

1193
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
He's drunk

1194
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,295
America's wedding

1195
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
We had America Underwater

1196
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
Guys were rolling back bubble coming out

1197
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,151
Super Facebook

1198
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,111
Noodle promo family

1199
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,439
Euro promote churches

1200
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,615
This is embarrassing

1201
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Hold on

1202
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Disagree

1203
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
That was

1204
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,855
Beautiful instance of character work cuz there was a journey

1205
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159
Tremendous it was

1206
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
I mean there is pesos

1207
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,095
I have not seen better acting out of Alex

1208
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,143
Franklin

1209
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,215
I've seen a lot of professional place

1210
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
Not as good at acting

1211
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,775
Will get respect

1212
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,383
Anti family stuff here towards the end of the

1213
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Episode

1214
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
Next live show we're just going to open

1215
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,551
With a transcript

1216
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:53,951
Of this class staged readings Tire thing we're going to have some but we're going to hire a professional

1217
01:10:54,207 --> 01:11:00,351
Probably he's gettable

1218
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,143
Be great Alex

1219
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,703
If we do do a show in Austin

1220
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,943
That be great title is just Alex's too drunk to pay attention

1221
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
I wonder what that mean

1222
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
At this point

1223
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,415
44% of the country doesn't trust the FBI

1224
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,071
We don't trust

1225
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Hillary Clinton

1226
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:45,407
Daffy Duck

1227
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,807
Another place where he and I agree

1228
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,671
I mean

1229
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Crazy

1230
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
Know the facts

1231
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,095
Titanoboa decision at all

1232
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,767
I would rather watch this than Rosencrantz and

1233
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
Interjet

1234
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:45,567
I hate to say like people should go watch something

1235
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,383
Does Don but Chula Vista

1236
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,455
It does add a bit to it like a video of

1237
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,295
He's doing like weird faces at the camera and stuff he's f******

1238
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,575
Tanked what is this

1239
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:04,767
He's playing the game that he plays a lot that I think is one of his greatest skills and that is the hinge word game

1240
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:11,679
The guy says

1241
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,519
Define the word to him

1242
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,311
Much like I do with transmission

1243
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
But Alex

1244
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,943
You will rant

1245
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,479
And it doesn't work

1246
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Speaking of fueling rants

1247
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:32,927
A little bit

1248
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Antifa

1249
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,535
Penis game

1250
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:46,239
Didn't need to be people in the street

1251
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,423
Alex Jones live

1252
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:34,879
Overthrow

1253
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,695
Embarrassing

1254
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:44,095
I want to talk about what he's talking about this is just realize

1255
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,911
How playing this would make me super uncomfortable

1256
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,799
It's me

1257
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
I don't want

1258
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,359
I don't want to kick

1259
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,199
Kick him when he's down

1260
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
Saturday morning today when were recording this

1261
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,831
I imagine he woke up hungover

1262
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,111
What did I do

1263
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
06

1264
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
2000 views

1265
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,487
Oh well no way let's pretend that didn't

1266
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,767
Here is why this is

1267
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,327
Have you ever read the comic book

1268
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,911
No or seen the TV show

1269
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,679
No

1270
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
No dork

1271
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,055
Go ahead

1272
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:31,455
The reason that my mind is because if I understand the mythology correct

1273
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
The legion

1274
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:39,391
The demon write Professor Xavier

1275
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Sun okay

1276
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,719
Charles Xavier son

1277
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:49,119
The most powerful

1278
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Bux-mont

1279
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
What hold on

1280
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:03,199
All of his powers though or whatever come from multiple personalities in his brain

1281
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:09,087
So anytime he wants to do with thing he has to use the guy who's I get why it's boring

1282
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
But my point is

1283
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:16,255
If you got this guy drunk enough to where all the sudden all of those personalities are just

1284
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:20,863
Randomly whatever they want to like that's what Alex

1285
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,399
There is no out

1286
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,799
No there still are not looking for Alex we're looking for whatever part of Alex's brain to shown up on any website

1287
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
The core

1288
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
Legion has even taken over by Lee

1289
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,951
Form ideas of trump being involved with Russia

1290
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,839
Because

1291
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Discontinued

1292
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
Texas

1293
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,303
American troops on our supporters

1294
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
Fuel station

1295
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Newk's

1296
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,735
It's cuz he wants to give them free energy

1297
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
Little boy

1298
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,863
Haven't you ever even seen this clip before

1299
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
If you watch

1300
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,983
Yeah he might

1301
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:08,383
Show the clip that he's reviewing I'm sure Paul Joseph Watson wrote the article or something

1302
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,455
Making some s*** up

1303
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
No I mean I don't know

1304
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
ICBM

1305
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
Depleted uranium

1306
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:23,231
Mom them two are the borders of Russia but we are

1307
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,511
Now that's a good idea

1308
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,375
I don't know man I just think he's he's

1309
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
At this point

1310
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Comedy

1311
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:38,079
He's trying to get in there with his exasperation loving it

1312
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,639
Bada-bing bada-boom a I was gone

1313
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,711
Vegas is the most enjoyable Bob Hope that I've ever

1314
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:47,807
So at that point the end

1315
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,879
This guy realizes that the clip ends

1316
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,583
Here is that and then Alex trying to desperately trying to figure out something else

1317
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351

01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,007
Is Trump racist

1323
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311

1324
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335

I think he's getting defensive

1331
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:15,360
Quoting the president

1332
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,368
Is true

1333
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
You're rushing it

1334
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,792
Remember

1335
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Don't talk about

1336
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
Family health chart

1337
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,176

01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,392
What's the weather

1339
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,584
He said let's go back here cuz he's trying to throw back to the cliff that the clip is over

1340
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Something else to talk about

1341
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,984
It's like Robert De Niro doing

1342
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,312
Rich Little doing an impression of Robert De Niro

1343
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
It's very bad

I don't even I don't even care about it like Infowars reportaj

1356
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
It's so bad that I don't even

1357
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:20,800
I didn't want to look into what the truth of that article is

1358
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
I would love to just be like

1359
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:28,992
CareFirst

1360
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,808

1361
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
About is

1362
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
How Alex Johnson

1363
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,184
Tutu reference

Lyrica

1367
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,096
I looked up

1368
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,936
What Lena Dunham said and I shouldn't have is how I operate on most

1369
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
I looked at what Michael Moore said and I shouldn't have

1370
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
Most Alex Jones

1371
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
Headlines

1372
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,152
Sometimes they're good opportunities for education

1373
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
S*** about

1374
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,832
Especially

1375
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
Don't care

1376
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
Let's get to this this is the last

1377
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
Hard yes

1378
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,680
So I don't know I couldn't find a place to cut this clip

1379
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:23,520
I couldn't figure out a segment or anything like that so we'll go in the middle

1380
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,176
He starts by talking about it

1381
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,344
Representative

1382
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,392
This is really more about the impression

1383
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,232
Joy Reid

1384
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,792
Trump using the word

1385
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,096
Oh my God.

1386
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,120
Stop

1387
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,824
Church in America

1388
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:08,576
His commitment sadly

1389
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,160
Call Trophy

1390
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
Nationalism

1391
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,632
Scout

1392
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,216
Oh yeah

1393
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,744
Launches back to the

1394
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
The other Bernie

1395
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:53,376
Joy-ann Reid put out was

1396
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,168
I made her point

1397
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,216
Correct all the all the

1398
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,008
Tropes

1399
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,056
Speech were very

1400
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
Civil rights

1401
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
Era

1402
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
His behavior does

1403
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,296
Consistently the rhetoric is very

1404
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:15,136
Why are we still talking about right

1405
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
To me is like

1406
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,464
Okay but what's fun is

1407
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,048
Paul Joseph Watson wrote this article on Alex Jones is covering it

1408
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,608
On this drunk Rambles

1409
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,632
And if therefore

1410
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:29,728
Pretending it can't handle the word family

1411
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,776
That's not really

1412
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Well I remember

1413
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,128
I remember reading something about

1414
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:42,272
Liberals were triggered that Trump said the word America like 85 right

1415
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,856
The point is

1416
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:51,744
Is this is a dumb thing to do mission of the forest for the trees

1417
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,280
You're pretending

1418
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:57,120
The complaint is that someone said family

1419
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,680
Isn't saying

1420
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:06,336
All of these trips that he's hearkening to our from era that is no longer here

1421
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,896
Anymore

1422
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,480
Families don't exist anymore

1423
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,808
What I

1424
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,624
Like the thing that I

1425
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,160
Constantly think about

1426
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,720
With all of the

1427
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,488
Constant

1428
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
Like borracho

1429
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
Here's the new

1430
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:32,448
Sing like obviously it's racist

1431
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:40,384
Like the whole Russia investigation like that's not going to wind up with Trump being indicted

1432
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:45,760
Jail or even most likely impeached unless we genuinely retake both houses

1433
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
Of Congress

1434
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
Hopefully we'll be able to

1435
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,648
The whole problem I have with all of it

1436
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,952
Is that we already have enough

1437
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,768
He should already be gone

1438
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
Worse

1439
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
Airport

1440
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,376
New news

1441
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
Really f***** me over because it's like

1442
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:08,288
It's like it supersedes the old news

1443
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
No no

1444
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:18,272
Profiting off the presidency

1445
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,576
You're missing the point

1446
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,904
You're missing the greater point that is what

1447
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
This Administration

1448
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,976
Has been able to do

1449
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,304
Is a large-scale presidential version

1450
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,840
What Alex does with his narrative

1451
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:38,752
You know there's all this terrible stuff and then they never gets proven then we moved onto the next time there's never a consequence

1452
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,800
Get into the next storyline

1453
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
The next

1454
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
That's almost

1455
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,432
Spiritually why they're perfect match

1456
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,832
In the chat room

1457
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368

Jonesboro

1461
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:33,280

Look into your heart

1467
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,672
Not taking care of yourself is a bad thing

1468
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,744
That I had to boost the audio cuz he's basically whisper

1469

Alright

You are a holding your spit take

1499
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,616
On purpose

1500
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,920
Action template

1501
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:06,528
We gave lin-manuel Miranda

1502
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,952
Look.

1503
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
Alright

1504
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
We write the best music there's ever been

1505
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,376
And we close it with Alex Jones he's on his knees

1506
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:25,472
Soft spot light jumped on him everybody is f******

1507
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,568
Because nobody knows what's going on

1508
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,848
Beautiful birds

1509
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,384
Sexy man

1510
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:42,624
That's his last words

1511
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
Right

1512
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
Portal 2 the musical

1513
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,536
No I've moved past that

1514
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:53,632
Music

1515
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:56,192
The issue for me is

1516
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,472
I want to come back to

1517
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,496
Like

1518
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
The Comedy of it and

1519
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
The character

1520
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
It's 2

1521
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,408
Consistent cuz at the end he's like doing this Bernie Sanders

1522
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:08,736
This is great

1523
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:10,528
Images

1524
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
I remember either I thought you said that he's a good man

1525
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,112
Nevermind

1526
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Nevermind

1527
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:56,096
Nevermind he's a bad man

1528
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:56,864
Exactly right

1529
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,752
I guess the character work is more consistent than I was imagine

1530
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,032
F****** s*** man

1531
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,080
The end result of this

1532
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
Not really any real

1533
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
To discuss politics

1534
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,432
Because much as it is

1535
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
Alex

1536
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
You need to get help

1537
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:16,064
And we just drank a bottle of wine while recording this

1538
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,392
You are the problem and here's what it comes down to

1539
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,952
Good Deed the recklessness with which he is

1540
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,744
Demonizing people calling

1541
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,792
Media personalities Vienna

1542
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,352
You f******

1543
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,400
C********* f****** nonsense

1544
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,936
F*** f*** s***

1545
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,496
That that sort of stuff

1546
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
Discount

1547
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,640
Doing that I would feel bad about

1548
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
We do not have nearly the amount of love

1549
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,016
He influences people

1550
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,064
The fact that he sees fit

1551
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
To just get

1552
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,856
Really drunk

1553
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
And ramble about nothing

1554
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,696
In ways that are

1555
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,232
Specifically dangerous

1556
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
2

1557
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,280
Other civilian

1558
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
Yeah I don't I don't think

1559
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
I think

1560
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,168
Alcoholism is not

1561
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
Defined by the amount you drink

1562
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,984
Or the regularity that

1563
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
The consequences

1564
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
Cuz of your drain

1565
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
If you look at it through that prism

1566
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,152
The times that we've heard Alex

1567
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,176
Drunk on the show

1568
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,040
I think they're

1569
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,600
I think they were very serious

1570
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,136
Consequences

1571
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,160
The key doesn't

1572
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,720
Other

1573
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
Have to feel it

1574
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,024
And

1575
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,816
I think if you had any amp

1576
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
You would recognize

1577
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
Is the damage that he

1578
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
He's doing to people

1579
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Because of his

1580
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,472
And I would

1581
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Encourage him

1582
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:47,200
And I would allow this to go on the internet

1583
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,224
This is embarrassing

1584
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,784
I say that is Alex Jones is sworn enemy

1585
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,088
This is disgusting and embarrass

1586
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
This is a disgrace

1587
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,672
It is Alex

1588
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,976
Agreed to let them put this up

1589
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,512
He's a f****** idiot

1590
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,048
You must have

1591
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
He must have told them

1592
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,984
He must have pretty probably did when he was drunk he probably was wasted inside but it up and there's no one there

1593
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
Alex come on

1594
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
It's like having a boy King

1595
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,128
Yeah

1596
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,152
Well you're always

1597
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:19,968
He's living at the behest of the whims of a child

1598
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,248
Yeah

1599
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,064
In a in a real job

1600
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
For putting out garbage

1601
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:29,184
Spray fired if you said

1602
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
This is embarrassing

1603
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,256
UB murder

1604
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:35,840
20 minutes

1605
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,912
I should impression but you can just cut bait you don't have to put it out

1606
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,568
This is sad

1607
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
We stay in that impression

1608
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,064
Most closest

1609
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,232
Most people could not stay in a bad character for that long

1610
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,536
He slid through three or four characters

1611
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
At least he was

1612
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,472
Credit for that

1613
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Pittsburgh

Abstract as it said by Alex Jones doing

1619
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
I don't know them

1620
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,120

Well usually we

1622
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
You know

1623
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
Call someone

1624
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,288
Selves

1625
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
I guess I would say I mean I don't go to the fair one

1626
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
To do but I would say

1627
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,528
Alex's Mafia

1628
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:03,904
