1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Text Joan

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888

00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Sup

8
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,800
My brakes I forgot

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Christmas

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
Gifts that came in from

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
Book here I haven't had a chance

20
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Crack into it but it's about Lovecraft

21
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
HG Wells book from that era where if you were science fiction writer you also

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,808
So had to write the rise and fall of the Roman Empire or Lowe's along those lines

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
The other gorgeous hardcover books

24
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
I appreciate that I always loved a dignified hardcover Neverland a hardcover

25
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,192
One rule also Christy

26
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Out like a indoor

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
Campfire

28
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Immediately said to me

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
We're not doing this inside

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,160
That's true you do that there I am not a lucky window it could do that

31
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,304
Cool cool stuff

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
How about you

33
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,912
My bright spot of courses

34
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,520
But also I have finally gotten into the expanse

35
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:57,664
The Sci-Fi series of novels and television that every Syfy nerd has

36
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
Unequivocally praise

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
Almost non-stop for about 50

38
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Teen years finally

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
I have caught up to the party

40
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
And it's

41
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
Welcome it's really good you say is if I've watched

42
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
You haven't

43
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:17,632
Condescendingly has helped in the spirit of

44
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Hurrah

45
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
So Jordan today we've an interesting episode to go over

46
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
It's going to be on our plate

47
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
We've got

48
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
And that was on Christmas Alex put out an emergency warning

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
To Donald Trump

50
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
About the vaccines and stuff

51
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
He's very mad about Trump the sporting black

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Recovered on the last episode

53
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
And is it escalated to a Christmas Day emerge

54
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Message

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Put down the Coco

56
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,608
Tell Baron to go to the other room

57
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
I got a warrant

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Camels and horses in the opposite direction to come bearing gifts of Frankincense myrrh and a dire warning

59
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,968
Then we're going to be going over Wednesday December 29th

60
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
I tricked you into saying I had to really Revolution

61
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Is the game on the last

62
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
We can go with it

63
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
So we're going to do this

64
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
First of all because there's some

65
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799

66
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079

67
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
I also because I want to get us

68
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Pretty much caught up because on Monday

69
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
I'd really like to finally get into reset Wars

70
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
Damn time where can I get into reset one of these days

71
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
It's. Clones

72
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Will be back

73
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
So we've got we got an emergency Christmas message but first

74
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095

Ewok

78
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Big Bird gold versus big

79
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Bigfoot thank you so much and I apologize

80
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
Next to mr. aptronym thank you so much and I'll probably walk

Thank you so much

82
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
In the mix

83
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
You're now a technocrat

84
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
What's the business

85
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Money off that heroin

86
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Freakishly large

87
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
All right here is not a contact drop Jordans

88
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,967
Let it be said on my Tombstone that I'm part

89
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
We got it okay

90
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
I will honor this request once you've passed

91
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Listen I'm going to give it to I'm going to give the wants a little bit of a

92
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
Glimpse into into a behind-the-scenes thing just so everyone knows every time he plays that

93
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
That's on both of us start dancing

94
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
We are doing

95
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,319
Alright you ready for this you doing on Christmas Day

96
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,231
We were sleeping for the most part there wasn't much to do because everything was closed

97
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
And also you know

98
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
So we were just kind of sleeping

99
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,191
I was watching reset Wars

100
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
To all a good-night

101
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
Here's what Alex was doing

102
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Is an emergency Chris

103
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
A warning

104
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
2 president

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Trump

106
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
You were either

107
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Completely ignorant

108
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
The so-called facts

109
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Gene therapy

110
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
But you helped Rams

111
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Proof of operation

112
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,463
Or you're one of the most

113
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Evil man

114
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Who has ever

115
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Lived

116
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
The Porsche

117
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Toxic poison

118
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
The public

119
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Constituents

120
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
They simply try to save their lives

121
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
And the lives of

122
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
We're about to lay out

123
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
The basic

124
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Facts

125
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
What you told

126
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Candace Owens

127
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Few days ago

128
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
It's nothing but a raft

129
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Realized

130
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
You know sometimes either or statement

131
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,975
Feature two things that are not mutually exclusive in both can be true at the same time

132
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Also raft

133
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Nice

134
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
Flip toss

135
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Yeah it's nice to get rid of trump

136
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
That's like a grip you got to grab me something

137
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,479
The original

138
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Just kind of responded to

139
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
To Trump's appearance

140
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
What's Bill O'Reilly or admitted he got the booster chair and all this this point

141
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Candace Owens

142
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Where she hit that I've been like implying

143
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,559
I'm saying that the vaccines

144
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
People are vaccinated of the ones who were in the hospital's Italian most

145
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:43,007
Of course no no no no no no playing the game right

146
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,359
No answer this is what he's got Alex's goose

147
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
Christmas Day

148
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,831
And we saved under covid this year by the way under Joe Biden

149
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
Then under you and what people took the vaccine

150
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
In this year so people are Quest

151
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
Shanaynay

152
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
The one chick

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Very sick and go to the

154
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
The ones that don't take that Maxine

155
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
But

156
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
It's still their choice

157
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
And if you take the vaccine you up

158
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Sexy results

159
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
The vaccine a good ad

160
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
If you do get it

161
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
It's a very minor form

162
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,919
People are dying when they taking a backseat recently Candice

163
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Owens

164
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
Confront you polite

165
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Face-to-face with the fact

166
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
Show called vaccines

167
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Are causing a lot of death

168
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
An illness

169
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
And you

170
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
DoubleDown

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Sing that

172
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Nobody

173
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Has been hurt

174
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
By the shop

175
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
But that is just

176
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
A flat-out

177
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
Lie but it is a dirty lie.

178
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,727
There's one explanation for this witches

179
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,847
In order to believe that the vaccines are more dangerous than being unvaccinated

180
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
You would have to be

181
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
Dumber or more evil than Donald

182
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
J Trump

183
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
That's interesting

184
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
Tough to wrestle

185
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Yes I thought that obviously I have

186
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
Watching reset Wars and s*** like that course

187
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,959
Can't handle watching a full episode of whatever Candace Owens

188
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
No not that I'm going to watch Tim pool

189
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175
Absolutely no watch the whole thing

190
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
That's about appearance

191
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
It was pretty funny

192
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,647
Cancel it seem very confused by not being on board

193
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,999
The mainline Trump community and he's exposition

194
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
The speed with which he said

195
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
No no no

196
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Was was almost

197
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Delicious

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
Yeah this is really pissed Alex off

199
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
To the point where

200
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Christmas

201
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
He's got it released this message where

202
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,615
Reviews clearly pre-recorded this there

203
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Probably multiple takes like

204
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
You can hear. Performative voice haha

205
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
That was cut to

206
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
So

207
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,927
We get to a little bit more of of this

208
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Alexandra saying it like this is whatever Trump saying hear the

209
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
And then you

210
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
Triple down

211
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
On top of that

212
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
And said that 90% of

213
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
In the hospital

214
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Around the world

215
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Tap.

216
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
The vaccine

217
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
When the facts

218
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
Statistics show the APA

219
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
In Germany

220
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
In the UK in the US

221
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
In Canada

222
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Across the world in place

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Israel

224
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
The double A

225
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
And triple vac

226
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
Are more than

227
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
2 *

228
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Had to be hospitalized and or die

229
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
In fact a new study

230
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Came out

231
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Justice League

232
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Here it is

233
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
For you to research

234
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
But we spent so much time going over specific claims when they popped up on Alex's show in the pass I'm not even going to get back into the Weeds on the

235
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,079
Claims like about vaccinated people twice as likely to be hospitalized

236
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
It's just an old

237
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,431
False talking point but I was curious about this new study

238
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,551
Generally end up listening to stuff and what becomes

239
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
Necessary for me to check visually I'll go and watch the video

240
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,975
And so when Alex says that there's a new study out for Trump to research

241
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,095
The image that's on the screen is just a screenshot of a tweet that Ezra Levant posted

242
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
How about 8

243
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
A review

244
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
Great doesn't it doesn't get

245
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Much more,

246
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Concrete than that it really does it

247
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,919
Dick's big they're blowing everyone's minds and making an appeal to the former president

248
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Save the world they can't even be bothered to

249
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Trackdown the actual study

250
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Get a screenshot of that do this show a tweet

251
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
The link to the study is in the tweet wow you have to

252
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Through

253
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Alex through so embarrassing

254
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,559
But I wanted to say something about the experience of going through Hazard is

255
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Twitter feed

256
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
The link to the study

257
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:58,239
Houston kind of shocking how just stroll just scrolling through it heightened by anxiety

258
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
It's just a barrage of memes and Sensational post to make an arguments that I know or flawed and dumb

259
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
But the sheer volume of them and

260
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
The quickness that they come at you

261
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Confidence

262
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
These people with s*** positions they do

263
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Just proper them up

264
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
It's still heading

265
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Effect on me

266
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
It was horrifying.

267
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Consider with the experience to be like for someone who didn't

268
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Know that these people are all liars and con men

269
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
He's so scary to take in

270
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,839
How long it would take you

271
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,191
To track down all this barrage of bulshit this coming at you

272
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
It's it's

273
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Visceral

274
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,615
Yeah I mean we're in the situation now where I think it was

275
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
Fundamentally asking the Eternal Quest

276
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Who gots like the gas

277
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
Who I am now and I turns out it's

278
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
While he's also be

279
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Gas-lit

280
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
So this study

281
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:54,815
It almost certainly will either have to be redone or retracted as soon as any review begin

282
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
The quote as well as analysis of the study that shows that quote

283
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,495
Customers are 76.5 more percent more likely

284
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Customers are 39 points

285
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
3% more likely to be infected then unvax

286
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
This is in regards to vaccine affect effective

287
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
Against the Omicron.

288
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,623
The reason I saved this study will probably never make it past the reviews that there's a glaring methodological

289
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,183
Ankle problem with how they prepare the data for the study

290
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
There were three groups of people that they look

291
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Unrest

292
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,095
Play the people people have gotten two doses of moderna if people have gotten to do so

293
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
The Pfizer

294
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
It's very well well maybe the fact that there is a reduced efficacy overtime for these vaccines against the Omicron variants

295
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,127
But quite likely the reason there's a negative efficacy reflected in these numbers

296
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Is that the study excluded

297
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
People who had previously tested positive with a PCR

298
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Which Korea

299
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Some problem

300
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
For the data

301
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
What is use the people who tested positive previously are probably going to be a group at skews heavily towards being unvaccinated

302
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
And it's been shown that the Omicron Barenaked apps

303
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Absolutely reinfect people who previously

304
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Leacock covid

305
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Removing

306
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,703
Group from the dataset may have an effect on the results are released would be a cause for

307
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Concern to trust be specific

308
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
To the numbers is being reflected

309
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Reality

310
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Absolutely

311
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,919
Even leaving that concern aside the authors of the study provided a very reasonable

312
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Explanation for the numbers that

313
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Makes sense

314
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,831
The negative estimates in the final. Arguably suggest

315
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,927
Different behavior and or exposure patterns in the vaccinated and unvaccinated

316
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
Causing an underestimation of the vaccine

317
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,375
This is likely the result of Omicron spreading rapidly initially through singles

318
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Super spreading events

319
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,727
Causing many infections about young vaccinated

320
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Right

321
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
This would make intuitive sense

322
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Super spreader

323
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,919
Could have occurred in places where vaccination was required to enter and this is an issue

324
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Particularly relevant to this study

325
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Subjective

326
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
This study were all people in Denmark

327
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Which is actually pretty route

328
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,463
In September Denmark lifted all of its covid restrictions and went back to business as usual

329
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
It was believed that there was a high enough vaccination rates there is no longer any reason to be required to show proof of vaccinations at bar

330
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
Bars and clubs or anywhere

331
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
This was prior to the first ident

332
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Application of the Omicron variant by researchers in South Africa on November 24th

333
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,431
In mid-november it was starting to become an issue in Denver Ark that cases were starting to go up again

334
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,295
And on November 29th the Danish Health authorities re-imposed Public Health measures

335
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
And crew including real requiring masks

336
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
And not allowing people to enter many places

337
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Without a Corona pass

338
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,071
If you look at this study you'll see that this is the precise time frame when their data was being collect

339
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
The first check-ins were on November 20th

340
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Yes and it ended at the earliest

341
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
December 12th

342
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Unless there was a positive test for a death that would lead to obviously

343
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Here's the contact

344
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
It's very important

345
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
If you go to the Danish government site about the corona pass

346
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
These are the groups who are eligible

347
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
To get that pass

348
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,647
You can get a Corona pass if you have been previously infected within the last 6 months

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:05,279
Have been vaccinated or tested negative with the PCR test that is no more than 72 hours old

350
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:09,375
And for Rapid tests that is no more than 48 hours

351
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,287
People who are unvaccinated but who have tested positive in the past within the last six months are eligible for the past

352
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359
That would allow them to be in places with potentially High concentration

353
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
The people around when Omicron was going wild

354
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,479
Super fighting events were most likely occurring

355
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Well

356
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,111
Still very well may be the case that protection against Omicron variant is weaker

357
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
The further one is out from the vaccine

358
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,255
The negative Effectiveness may be implicated by these confounding factors

359
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
And likely doesn't reflect a reality where the vaccine

360
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
Make a person more likely to get

361
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Not

362
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Really something you could

363
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Use this non-peer-reviewed study

364
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Tobacco

365
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,407
So what were kind of describing is a situation where so many people are vacs

366
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Sedated

367
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,759
That's the available pool of subjects

368
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,575
Is such that it's more likely to find

369
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
Vaccinated people are being

370
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Reinfected

371
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Simply because there's so many more of them

372
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
Is that kind of what we're talking about I don't believe so because I think the rates

373
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
Will probably take care of that

374
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
Balancing of that

375
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
I think

376
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
Faulty application of

377
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
The cohort

378
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
In the in the data

379
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Not including

380
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
People who have tested positive in the past

381
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
I reflect

382
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Skew things

383
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Towards

384
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,183
All right away from unvaccinated people having higher infection

385
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,303
I believe that there is an argument you could make on that front and whether or not it's

386
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,679
Bully true or not I do think it's enough of an issue with how this was set up

387
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
That

388
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
You probably

389
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
Would want to redo it the data to the point where the conclusions you could draw from it are too tainted by that

390
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
At data being skewed

391
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,575
Baby yeah baby yeah

392
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
Exactly and you need to know more before you could really

393
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,023
Make any kind of conclusion

394
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
Also you have to consider this

395
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,167
For all but nine days of the time that the study was taking place

396
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,519
Unvaccinated people couldn't go on public transit or enter bars or restaurants

397
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,151
Where is vaccinated people could as well as people who were not vaccinated but who had tested positive in the past

398
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:34,527
Write these factors make the raw data that you may see blood say like in a tweet posted by

399
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
Notorious Canadian propagandist

400
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
Blastin the full picture

401
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,463
Exactly how much of a lowered Effectiveness there is overtime

402
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
This study alone is

403
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Going to prove anything

404
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,887
Don't think Trump's going to research today

405
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Picture of a tweet

406
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Garbage

407
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,055
What is a one of the nice things about science

408
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
And the peer-review process

409
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,735
Is that when you have a lot of people all coming to the same results are far more reliable than if you just have

410
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
One study out of Denmark

411
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Yeah

412
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
Kinds of questions are not really even missed

413
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
On the authors of the study

414
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,815
Does the conclusion of the study even with these like rod numbers that would

415
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,399
Possibly be able to be taken out of context to show a

416
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
Looking negative riding 6%

417
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,567
Babe that's not the conclusion that they come to write based on

418
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Certain

419
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Of contact

420
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
Wow that almost

421
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
Makes me think that if any any

422
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
Eddie study now

423
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Should have like

424
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,831
Highlighted sections where the authors are like hey

425
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
This data could be

426
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,439
Be taken out of context that used for evil purposes

427
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,719
Just like big

428
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Giant

429
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Bullet points of light

430
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
Here's how propagandists might take this

431
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,471
You can even go to the setting be like to hear what they said you or a little junk where it's just like

432
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,031
Bad

433
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
To study hit with a rolled-up newspaper ideas every every study has a point where it's like

434
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,527
Sexy don't take this out of context Alex you piece of s***

435
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
This goes on at the

436
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
Plan out of the globalist

437
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Quite terrifying

438
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,232
To know about this

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Within 3 MI

440
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
You are twice as

441
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
Is likely to be

442
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Become infected

443
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Omicron

444
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
The Pfizer

445
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,520
That's because it's a racing your immune

446
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
And that was the

447
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
The plant

448
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,872
Erase the populations amused

449
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Make them dependent

450
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
Ongoing gene therapy

451
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Have to be taken

452
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
As often

453
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
Everyday

454
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,392
That's so stupid that I don't even really know where to begin with

455
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
I guess I would say that Alex would probably have done the second take every said omnicron

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,352
Actually thinks that's the name

457
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
Rattling it it almost more importantly though if the vaccines were wiping up people's immune systems you would just be seeing

458
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Sing an increase in cases of covid particularly Omicron

459
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
You be seeing people dead

460
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
Everywhere from normally very minor things

461
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Without proper medical attention people who are vaccinated would be dying or getting severely ill from bacteria that we all normal

462
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Encounter on a regular basis

463
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
People be ending up in the ER all over the place with things like food

464
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
I mean I guess you could if you had a severe case of food poisoning anyway but you know what I mean

465
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,192
Ammonia would lay waste to this land

466
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,080
Similarities

467
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,640
It does share a lot of similarities with what you would

468
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Expect to see you in the car

469
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Right right circumstances of covet

470
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
For four people who were infected with HIV for the longest time it was not that the actual

471
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
Hy-Vee would kill them

472
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
It would destroy their immune systems

473
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,744
To the point that they would be killed by many other differ

474
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Sure

475
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Yep

476
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
Alex is saying about how you're twice as likely to get infected if you get the Pfizer vaccine doesn't match up with a misrepresentation

477
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Somebody's reporting from Ezra Levant

478
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Crank but I don't even know what's going on tonight

479
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Lovett weird compound in

480
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Yes

481
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,664
So we talked about tranches earlier just because

482
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Fast forward

483
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
We know this word

484
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,064
Is now identifiable with the FDA

485
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Better being released

486
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Visa vie

487
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
There

488
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Security check

489
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
Exit and safety

490
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,536
Measure surrounding the the Pfizer shot

491
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,656
Tranches

492
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
That is

493
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,240
The big Pharma takeover

494
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Of humanity

495
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Helium

496
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
From day one

497
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
So-called back

498
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Roll out

499
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Pfizer in the FDA

500
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Plot to the

501
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Stop

502
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Being released

503
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,296
The medical whistleblower group

504
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
The last two months

505
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Federal courts have ordered

506
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
FDA to release

507
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Several tranches

508
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
A millions of pages of.

509
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
The first

510
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
2

511
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Data Doctors

512
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,096
Show conclusive

513
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,144
The show called Maxine

514
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Bowser

515
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Thousands of death

516
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,496
And more than 100

517
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Thousand

518
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Adverse

519
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Including

520
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,128
Spontaneous abortion

521
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:22,272
It's so funny to me that Alex thinks he's fighting a big campaign against big Pharma when he couldn't

522
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,832
Stop promoting hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin

523
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
Ivermectin Zone by Merck

524
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
And the most prevalent form hydroxychloroquine is

525
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,720
Is produced by sanofi SA

526
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:36,864
He's going to stick at the big Pharma by encouraging people to buy a bunch of stuff from the Starbucks

527
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,192
So evil you got to be on Instagram

528
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,032
It's nice to hear that there's more conscious of documents now

529
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
We've already gone over Alex's narratives about this dumb s*** back on episode 626 so I'm not going to be

530
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Over it all again

531
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,320
He's talking points haven't changed at all so I don't really believe he's seen any of the new document

532
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
Once that have been released

533
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
How the initial documents the ones he lied about initially were released

534
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,488
On November 17th 2021

535
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
After that

536
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
A few PBSO released on December 1st

537
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
Another batch of documents on December 13th

538
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Mn1 index

539
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Israel on December 22nd

540
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
There's absolutely zero chance Alex's read any of the documents that were released on December 13th because he's already got ever

541
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Everything he needs to make up stories

542
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
From the first document that he read

543
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
That's enough

544
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,344
Why would you overcomplicate things when you can use that one document as a Bedrock to build whatever bulshit he wants on top of

545
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,976
Also Alex probably isn't interested in what's his argument at all

546
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,632
There's a 344 page analysis of efficacy trials that shows very strong efficacy results

547
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
So that

548
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Doesn't really help

549
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
Also

550
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,824
Hey 2030 page document listing interactions with participants in the trial

551
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,152
Like visits to get medical histories or document showing

552
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
Informed consent being given

553
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
How to get a dig through this

554
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,344
No one without anything for him to be mad about yet so the documents in this Toronto just

555
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
Basically the same as the ones in the old one

556
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
It's just more of the same thing which

557
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,792
Just kind of tell that he doesn't actually believe that anything to be revealed in any of these documents

558
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,680
If you actually believe that this was like a big smoking gone wouldn't be trying to squeeze out as much evidence as he could from them

559
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
It's just repeating the same old s***

560
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
Same old

561
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,128
It's not it's not that there's anything in there it's that they exist at all

562
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Write the Specter of them existing

563
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Zach is enough

564
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
To convince

565
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,040
Photo.

566
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
Know if you see a Komodo dragon in your leg you know that's probably means that there are dragons that fly around and shoot fire

567
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
That's not quite

568
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
The good boys

569
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
That's what makes sense

570
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
Because one exists obviously they eat most extreme person of it exists when I was a kid

571
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:52,032
Let you know I lived by for a bit

572
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,848
And all kinds of lizards

573
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
This taught me that reptilian aliens

574
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,248
Definitely

575
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:06,624
Fight one Gecko and you realize that if there was one that was saved several thousand

576
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Repeat all

577
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
You probably wouldn't win

578
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,512
So obviously that's something to be afraid of my most recent Wizards

579
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912
Anyway Alex what a great non sequitur

580
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,544
Resolution

581
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
I miss lizard Chase for lizards

582
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
So Alex

583
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
A little bit in this Christmas

584
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,760
Report I don't know if it's him

585
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,784
Someone who's editing

586
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,832
It does because they add in

587
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Clips

588
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
From Alex's show bolster

589
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,744
Alright

590
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
We've talked about this

591
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
FDA.

592
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
Trunks one

593
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,120
This is a massive story right here

594
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
And the documents that are in it

595
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,728
Which I'm sorry I met you

596
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
Thousands of more deaths thousands of more miscarriages

597
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,128
Bleeding out of your nose into having convulsions becoming paralyzed

598
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
Becoming blind

599
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,456
Are your ovaries basically dissolving

600
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Find covid-19

601
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,696
Women's periods

602
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
Eventually give you endometriosis where uterus is going to be removed

603
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
This President Trump

604
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Is what you are now

605
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Signing on

606
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:29,568
So there's a recent study that looked at the possibility of a connection between the vaccines and menstrual changes and they did find

607
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
Beta incidence of menstrual cramps

608
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
Seem to rise after vaccination

609
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
Is a total liar in a

610
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,344
This study has nothing to do with endometriosis or people needing to have their uterus is removed

611
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Panera

612
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
The actual study had to do with self-reporting

613
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,048
Any changes in menstrual patterns for women between the ages of 18 and 30

614
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
The specific changes they were looking

615
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Forehead to do with heavier

616
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
Your periods longer periods longer or shorter time between periods

617
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
And at any increased pain

618
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
I guess if Alex wants to play hypothetical OBGYN games and assume that any incidences of pain were secretly and Dimitri

619
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Trios I guess

620
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,784
Do that if you want but he's just be making that up because this study does not back that up at all

621
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
The author author

622
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,880
Very careful to point out that this date or Eliza

623
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,976
Entirely on self-reporting so there is a possibility that other variables

624
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,536
Could lead to participants not reporting their symptoms

625
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
With complete accuracy

626
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Also they do point out that their data shows that

627
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Foremost

628
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
The changes were Transit

629
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,776
And had returned to normal levels Windows to was given

630
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
Approximately two to three months after vaccination

631
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
With the first dose

632
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,480
They don't have any data get on the duration of any effects after dos2 but it does appear that it

633
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Probably will be similar to

634
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
The phenomenon Cena doseone

635
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,088
But that's like 2bc

636
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
There's indications of the probably

637
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Maybe have some effect

638
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Can I go back to

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,328
I'm absolutely not saying this is no big deal I don't want people to think that

640
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,120
But the study doesn't show the results

641
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
Better align with Alex's reporting

642
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
This is a pattern

643
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Because Alex is a habitual liar

644
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
Yeah loves to lie

645
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,664
And it's somebody who is not a weird 1930s man-child

646
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,064
Many times about her menstrual cycle and there are many different two variables that can make it early or late or heavy or light

647
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
Or whatever

648
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
Desert ongoing process

649
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
It's not like

650
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,768
Hey it didn't happen on the 22nd so we're all

651
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Ditto

652
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
I do not introduce the

653
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
This club because it's just fun Alex make a fun fret

654
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Okay this is

655
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
It's one thing to

656
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Watch the shoutout

657
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
Because you believed it would

658
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:40,896
Save the p

659
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
People and help in the lockdown

660
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
But now that you know

661
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
Signs you onto a fraud

662
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
You must extra

663
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Locate yourself

664
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
From this lie

665
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Or you will be

666
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
Forever known

667
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
At the end

668
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Vivi

669
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,256
What most valuable

670
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Vaccine

671
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
And the name problem

672
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Associated

673
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Pure Evil

674
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,216
There's no way that wasn't written

675
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:09,312
Ahmed that was that was delivered so much like

676
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,664
I got this TV.

677
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,248
Seen too many comedians go up with a joke they knew couldn't

678
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,088
Fail and watch it fail and hear that exact same response

679
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
I also

680
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Think

681
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
That if you're going to do this

682
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
You got to find a way to make MVP work

683
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:33,120
You don't throw another another V in their otherwise you're just creating a new act like that make up a new Echo

684
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,192
Similar

685
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,568
Tune there if you're going to do and BP with four letters you know there's no point

686
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
You got your dream leaf

687
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,760
Impatient

688
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,808
Osteoporosis

689
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
Alimony avoider I got nothing

690
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,048
See that's why you have to prepare a heads-up acronyms a hard

691
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
The Dome

692
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,888
Alex brings up an expert

693
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,448
Here that supposed to convince Trump

694
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
You take this seriously baby

695
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
The inventor

696
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
MRNA

697
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Technology

698
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
Dr. Robert Malone

699
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Has gone public

700
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
For more than a year and a

701
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,200
Warning

702
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
Technology used

703
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
Counter a cold

704
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Would lead to serious

705
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Blood clot

706
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
An autoimmune disorder

707
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Arcadia

708
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
And now the hospital

709
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:30,976
Across the West

710
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
Western world

711
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Double facts

712
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
Patience

713
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Showing exact sign

714
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
Of Aging

715
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,728
There's no evidence of people or antibody-dependent enhancement from covid vaccine

716
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,824
I've seen Alex tried to present evidence of it but none of it proves anything

717
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Just headlines

718
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Maybe a tweet

719
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
I am tied that faulty

720
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
Misrepresented studies

721
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,528
Yeah it's always

722
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
Since to make it

723
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Conclusion on that

724
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,720
Malone it's definitely not a consensus opinion that he's the inventor of mRNA technology

725
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,376
He's been making that claim as he makes the rounds on all media Outlets like info

726
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Podcast Dark Horse

727
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
But it's not really

728
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Wayfair

729
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,080
He did some work in the late 80s that involved mRNA but their studies you can find that predate his work

730
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,152
Using mRNA stuff going back to at least

731
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
1978

732
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Center for technology

733
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,928
As well as it being kind of disrespectful to all the other scientists

734
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
The played a role in the gradual development

735
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,584
It's fun though tell me inventor of the technology because then you get to play out there

736
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
Undramatic game where the guy who invented something

737
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
It turned out to be deadly

738
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
Has to come out and try and stop the monster he created a really great story it's really fun it really is

739
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,944
Into the human psyche yeah but we all know that Robert Malone never would have become the MVP of

740
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,248
Bulshit about vaccines if it weren't for

741
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Sure

742
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Yeah

743
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,880
I made you I made you

744
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Twist away for a second and that was worth it

745
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,792
I was trying to find a way to add in hornacek

746
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,840
I was having a difficult.

747
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
This s*** Run Deep

748
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,472
On Infowars

749
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
For The Narrative of like I've got to fix the wrong

750
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,408
Like if you were called back when he was around doctor group claimed that he was motivated to sell Health Products

751
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,272
Cleanses to undo the damage that his father did because he allegedly invented Saran Wrap

752
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:35,392
Saran Wrap and Robert mRNA technology

753
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:41,792
But if you want to pretend those things are true you get 2% their stories as like a comic book s*** what is it what is

754
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:48,192
More f****** apocryphal than the sun trying to undo the damage of the father that I

755
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:52,544
Biblical Star Wars

756
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:59,968
Yes I was going a little bit deeper into the cannon but yes it is true

757
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
This boy was really confused because

758
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,600
Alex was talking about Robert Mueller

759
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,672
And then he starts home with somebody else but he doesn't say their name

760
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
And it's really confusing

761
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,816
Does dishonestly or anything

762
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Robert vallone

763
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
An emergency

764
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Warning

765
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Parents of the world

766
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
To not give their children

767
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
The experimental mRNA in

768
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
The most

769
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,176
Good names in the world

770
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Concerning vaccine

771
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
As the former

772
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Chief scientist

773
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
At Pfizer

774
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Overbite

775
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
He has looked at

776
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,648
Every angle of

777
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
This rollout

778
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
The US

779
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
But across the world and us

780
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Concluded

781
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Better to take deliberate

782
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Depopulation

783
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
Opera

784
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Targeting

785
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Humanity

786
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
With infertility

787
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
Blood clot

788
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Heart attack

789
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,288
Just confusing he started talking about Michael Heaton

790
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
Subjective

791
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
It sounded like it was almost edited out

792
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,320
It didn't have that car right there and you can hear the cut

793
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Changes the subject

794
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,672
Right it's a little bit concerning

795
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:19,072
Yeah I don't know why they would do that though because like the den play a video that has Michael udon's name on it right now

796
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Not like

797
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:26,240
It's not like you have to censor that cuz he's going to sue them or something I don't know he's a wacky

798
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
Do you think

799
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
I don't understand but it does if it gets there was an explanation that may present

800
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
Blur

801
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,040
Yeah you better about that out

802
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,696
Kesakitan as the former Chief scientist Pfizer it difficult over vaccine

803
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,000
This is a flagrant lied

804
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,280
It's meant to imply his pretend

805
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
What are you doing was working at Pfizer what you did

806
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:58,752
His title was vice president and chief scientific officer of the allergy and respiratory unit of Pfizer

807
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,824
He worked at the Pfizer plant in Kent which was closed

808
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
2011

809
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,712
Decided not to try to find another job in the industry but instead of cortisone pass

810
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
He convinced the higher-ups

811
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
TripAdvisor to allow them to work with some of their compound

812
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
They almost never do

813
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
He's telling of it

814
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,512
The key wasn't getting Pfizer to recognize that we could not pay cash for the asset

815
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
But we were willing to Grant equity in exchange for their assignment well spinning the dream of therapeutic use in an area

816
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,960
Is that at the time they had little interest

817
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,616
Essentially we would create upside in which they share and they needed to do nothing but agrees our proposition

818
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
The alternative most likely being that everything would be lost

819
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:43,552
Is out of this initiative he formed a biotech company called Z Arco

820
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,624
Which almost entirely focused on Dermatology

821
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
Particularly to eczema drug

822
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Candidates

823
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
But they have gotten from Pfizer

824
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
After showing a good deal

825
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:57,120
The promised largely surrounding a once-daily orally-administered eczema treatment called

826
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,680
Zpl 389

827
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,728
Zika was bought out by Novartis

828
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Sprint undisclosed

829
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,872
But some speculation has been made that it might have been upwards of a billion dollars

830
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:14,272
Great promising eczema drug

831
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
Anti-vaxxer with a billion dollars

832
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
Yeah I know I

833
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,560
This doesn't turn out great once you get past 10 million all monies imaginary to Mesa

834
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Whatever

835
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,888
Is Blvd made was largely based around

836
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,960
The promise of this drug zpl 389

837
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
And the potential that it had to become

838
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
A prophet

839
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
Coronavirus

840
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,384
However if you flash forward to July 2021

841
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,432
You'll learn that they story did not end well

842
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,736
The drug failed to perform in face

843
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,808
To a trials and Novartis decided to abandon it

844
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,856
In the process they took a hit of a proxy

845
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
Smelly 400

846
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
89 billion.

847
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,560
Wow wow almost half a billion dollars of side money

848
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:04,704
Wow

849
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
Yeah I mean

850
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,544
It was something that did not live up to

851
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,824
The early indications

852
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
And that was that

853
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:19,296
The largest thing on you Don's resume since 2011 and even prior to that when he was working advisory had nothing to do with vaccines

854
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Even infection

855
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Just disease

856
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
The nature of the work that he was doing

857
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,952
And have done is intentionally being fudged in order to lend his words

858
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
An unearned credibility

859
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:33,120
He's made a bunch of completely unfounded covid conspiracy claims in the past year or so but there's no proof for any of it

860
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,192
Other than 2.2 his fake former job title

861
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
And assumed that he was the 4th of March

862
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
Chief scientist for Pfizer then he must know what he's talking

863
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Same thing

864
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,712
The guy who's like turned against the company used to be in absolutely

865
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Same

866
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,880
Trucking storyline I'm doing the wrong absolutely most respected people in the

867
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,952
World regarding vaccine technology absolutely

868
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
Alex might respect you. A lot

869
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
Because he says without want

870
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,352
But that doesn't mean any object in the real world

871
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
Nonsense

872
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
Donna Malone

873
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Hey

874
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
Ways to get up on

875
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
About everything all the time

876
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
How can you get rich Dan that's it's a it's a meritocracy that we all know is 100% accurate

877
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
If you have money you're better than people who don't

878
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
I've heard that

879
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
I've heard that before

880
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
Alex is doing like

881
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,976
Weird Movie voices trying to threat

882
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,000
Trump baby

883
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
The world is watching

884
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
The world is

885
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Very very

886
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
You do

887
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
Right now

888
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Are you going to continue

889
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
Assign your fate and

890
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
Phaeton 2 cost

891
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
Bob and Bill Gates

892
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
And the tables group

893
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
And the whole Global issue an agenda

894
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Probably

895
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Or will you

896
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Stand up

897
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
And be the hero

898
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
So many of us

899
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
If you were

900
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
And say no

901
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Medical

902
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,232
This is so dramatic probably not

903
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
Yeah yeah yeah

904
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
That is

905
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,008
That is great that is really more fun to live in

906
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
Movie4u

908
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
That's true

909
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
Come on out

910
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:31,648
I miss that maybe over

911
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Malicious

912
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,560
I'm sure.

913
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,912
But they won't be thrown in a camera because he can't afford that kind of

914
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:48,800
So anyway and Bill Gates

915
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
They are they like to bite

916
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
I can choose.

917
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,687
This house

918
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Cardiff

919
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,223
Coming down

920
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,527
Klaus Schwab Peter.

921
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Bill Gates

922
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
Anthony fauci

923
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
They all bit off more

924
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
We know they premeditated

925
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
This whole operation

926
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Take over

927
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
I get it

928
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
You wanted to be the hero you wanted to go

929
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
Get the vaccine out there.

930
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,495
Economy moving again

931
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
I saw

932
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
How you were deceived

933
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
But now

934
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Clearly signing onto this

935
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
And that's why it's so important

936
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
Public record

937
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
Warren

938
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
You were conscious

939
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
You made

940
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
A decision

941
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
Okay

942
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
Don't know how to make

943
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
I mean

944
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
Can you imagine

945
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,143
Trump caring about any of this

946
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Snow

947
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,959
Gifts

948
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,007
That Dynamic gets a little bit

949
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
Too obvious

950
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,711
The report goes on cuz he just kind of imploring Trump to do something

951
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
Never going to do

952
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
President-trump

953
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
There's not

954
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Time left

955
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Across the world

956
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Children are

957
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Injected

958
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
With dangerous

959
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Gene therapy

960
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
The race their immune

961
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
And give them

962
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,351
Chronic illness

963
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
President-trump

964
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
You don't want this

965
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
To be your legacy

966
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
You don't want

967
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Tubi

968
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
The person that was

969
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Creek by fauci

970
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
The Takeover

971
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
And who later when confronted with the facts

972
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,479
Decided to be a coward

973
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
DoubleDown

974
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Betting on the Corp

975
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
Betting on big Pharma

976
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Betting on the UN

977
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
The build back better

978
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Great reset

979
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Don't throw in your lot with Bill Gates

980
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Don't throw in your lap

981
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
Stand with

982
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Club America

983
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
The world

984
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
Stand with the chilled

985
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
Come out and tell the public

986
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Call provel cheese arrest

987
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Get on the right side

988
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
What fortunate Limited

989
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:06,783
Trick Trumper fool them into getting his vaccines made but there's one thing I can't imagine

990
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
Ever happening

991
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,855
It's Trump coming out and saying that someone fooled him

992
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
Do you know Alex running

993
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
A pretty close race in terms of who the bigger narcissist is

994
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,279
Ego would never allow him to look that week

995
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
In public

996
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
That's a really fun way for Alex to present his point

997
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,703
You can do this blowhard s*** about how time is running out for Trump

998
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
How to turn back

999
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:28,799
A directly to Trump so when Trump inevitably does nothing

1000
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:35,455
How to pretend that he actually JoJo likely rejected

1001
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:40,063
It's ironic that this is a Christmas message because it does remind me of like

1002
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
If

1003
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,135
Santa had been bribed

1004
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,415
You cannot deliver

1005
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,975
Presents this year

1006
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
You got to think of the children Santa

1007
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
If you don't

1008
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:54,143
Do this this year it'll never happen again

1009
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:58,495
You got to change your mind there's nothing more valuable than the children Santa

1010
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
We got to make this movie

1011
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,127
Alex

1012
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,527
Videos getting a little annoying for me because it's so obviously meant to be for the audience while

1013
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,807
Tending to be a warning to Trump

1014
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
My feels to me like this is an attempt to soft-launch

1015
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:21,023
Turning Trump into a villain on the show while doing so in a way where hopefully people in Alex's who still support Trump

1016
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Turn on Alex

1017
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,887
I am stuck between two extremes community that he's helped cultivate

1018
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:31,775
The Trump idolaters and the anti-vax lunatics and now he's in the unenviable position of trying to thread the needle

1019
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,103
And whether retains as much of his Revenue stream as possible.

1020
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:35,871
Alienated

1021
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,407
Too much of either side

1022
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Let's

1023
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:42,527
Good good bad luck your way that you're going

1024
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
To convince hardcore Trump

1025
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
Bisnow evil

1026
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:53,535
It'll be tough and there's no way you're going to convince people who think that vaccines are killing everyone that it's okay for Trump to be like

1027
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
Things are great

1028
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,911
Well you got too far down the road of the vaccines are killing everybody

1029
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
That

1030
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
There's nobody

1031
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Who could

1032
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
Support vaccines that you could

1033
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
Keep your support for it's like if Ron Paul came out and was like everybody get the booster and Alex would have to be

1034
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,479
Be like Well Ron Paul was a great Patriot Buddies

1035
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
He's too old now he's lost his mind

1036
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Something like that you'd have to lose

1037
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,879
Whoever it doesn't

1038
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,719
His dad could be in favor of vaccines

1039
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Mitigating committing genocide

1040
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,583
Idea

1041
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
At all

1042
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,935
Acumen is audience

1043
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
Trump

1044
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
Hangers-on

1045
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
They're still around

1046
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,127
I think if they could accept this presentation of Alex turning the truck

1047
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
Yeah it wouldn't be too hard for them

1048
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Except

1049
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Oh that's

1050
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Yeah yeah

1051
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
Cereal wasn't going to do

1052
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
It's not enough

1053
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
Hey babe I'm dropping a big bomb is too much of a hard-on maker for all of these people to do that but

1054
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
I've been seeing some people posting

1055
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,911
Really drunk and started screaming

1056
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
How many didn't know that he was being recorded before he went live

1057
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
Years old

1058
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Posted

1059
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,943
The implication that it's current

1060
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
I want to say

1061
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:23,391
A beard in that we don't need you don't need help to make him look like a piece

1062
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,463
Alex

1063
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
He's got more threats

1064
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
About Trump's Legacy

1065
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
From every angle

1066
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
The globalist

1067
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
More than they can

1068
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
And their attempt

1069
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,519
To take over the planet

1070
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
Using this medical

1071
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Healthcare

1072
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
What's in the Rockefeller Foundation

1073
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
Operation lockstep

1074
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Is Destin

1075
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:46,943
To fail

1076
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
There isn't much

1077
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Set time for YouTube

1078
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Turn back from

1079
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
If you only care about your

1080
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Yourself

1081
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Your leg

1082
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,927
Will be that

1083
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Your legacy will be that

1084
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Your legacy

1085
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Is that of a

1086
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
Child

1087
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
Chiller

1088
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Using medical term

1089
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
Still time for you to turn back

1090
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,799
As their disgust over and over again operation lockstep isn't a real thing

1091
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
It's a lie about a Rockefeller document and basically just traces back to a meme

1092
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
What was list

1093
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,343
Essentially what's happened is it the two of them don't agree on the issue with the vaccine

1094
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
What's up level ice

1095
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
Expect that Alex knows

1096
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
The supposed evidence he's presenting is s***

1097
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
So the last option left

1098
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
Trump to help me expand the graph

1099
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
What is to extort him

1100
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,215
Alex isn't saying that if Trump doesn't change his tune on vaccines the natural result of that is the tramps like us

1101
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
Will that beat out of

1102
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
Monstrous baby killer

1103
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
You saying what a trump doesn't change his tune on vaccines

1104
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Alex.

1105
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,431
Yelling about how Trump is a monstrous baby killer

1106
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
That's what's going on

1107
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Alex

1108
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
I know a lot of

1109
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,671
Dirt

1110
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:01,439
Hotmail

1111
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
The subtext

1112
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,583
And text of this video is that the warning Alex has given Trump as a warning

1113
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
But he's going to turn his audience against Trump

1114
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,935
If he doesn't do what Alex wants to do

1115
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
By calling him a monster is baby

1116
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,591
This is meaningless and it's going to go nowhere for a couple Ruiz

1117
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,919
First the Trump caught world doesn't really need Trump

1118
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Himself anymore

1119
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
It'll take some effort to build up a new demagogue for them to Rally around but the physical person of trump isn't really that necessary

1120
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
If he goes again

1121
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Pillars of the

1122
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,767
Construct a Dogma that they've made then they'll have to choose whether they're more invested in Trump as a person

1123
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,535
Or the Kovach

1124
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:41,375
Conspiracies and anti-vax bulshit they base their right

1125
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:46,751
I suspect the most with you the ladder and you can see the similar Dynamic play out in the world

1126
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
Don't even really need Trump anymore even though there are the ideology was based on the idea that Trump was the anointed savior

1127
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,687
Was going to release the Swarm

1128
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
The storm

1129
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
It is it is

1130
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
Funny the

1131
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
The framing that we dealt with for so long

1132
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
Especially in the campaign for Trump

1133
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
How to become

1134
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Is who is this guy

1135
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,975
Why is this guy

1136
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,767
This guy this guy always

1137
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,351
When in reality he was only an avatar that was

1138
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Almost

1139
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Generated from the swamp of

1140
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Misery and hate

1141
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,799
Hatred that was already there and he was simply a conduit for it to it

1142
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Absolutely

1143
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:28,479
The second reason this is going nowhere is a shorter way of saying

1144
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
Second reason is going nowhere is because the solution for Trump would be to give in to the demands of these

1145
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
People who are threatened

1146
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
I need to turn on him

1147
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
In-N-Out

1148
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
To preserve his base

1149
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,255
That would be what it is like

1150
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
I was kind of hoping

1151
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
He'll do

1152
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
This would make Trump look super weak

1153
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,911
Which an effect eliminates the thing that makes him a

1154
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,447
Appealing to the base in the first place

1155
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,543
He was their strong man who's going to fight against their imaginary evil enemies

1156
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:57,151
So he shows himself to be weak enough to take a threat like this seriously you probably get Alex

1157
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,759
Not to talk s*** about it but the appeal that the Elders of strongman leaders essentially destroyed

1158
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,551
Rendering him more less useless

1159
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,183
Hi ever going to be your president and I have made it very clear iamsu

1160
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,743
Servient to Alex's whim

1161
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:18,143
He frightens me I don't want Alex to be mad at me it's not a good campaign rally and cry

1162
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,543
Know this whole thing feels really similar to Alex lashing out at work

1163
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:30,943
Brenda got him like a pig because Rogan wouldn't let Alex back on his show

1164
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
Sandy Hook

1165
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,039
In that case Rogan back down and gave him to Alex's.

1166
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,623
Possibly motivated by a misguided belief that they have a meaningful friendship

1167
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,183
In doing so he lost control of the narrative

1168
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,767
Alex now more or less own to the image of Joe Rogan

1169
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,863
For his audience and Rogan inexorably Public Image.

1170
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
I don't think of the full consequences of that decision of really even

1171
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,751
The Fallen Joey yet but I don't think it's going to look good nice

1172
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Cyborg

1173
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
Trump will do that and he never will

1174
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:04,991
Compass never going to see this message and even if you did you wouldn't give a s*** about houses meaningless threats

1175
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
They're being passed off as a warning

1176
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Matter

1177
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:14,207
Rogan only responded like that because he ostensibly believe them believes them to be friends

1178
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,511
I think it probably was a part of it yet I think

1179
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,535
Brokens also

1180
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
Maybe he's a little bit weaker than

1181
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,799
He likes to appear publicly or you just has a I mean

1182
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
Miss blade

1183
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
Misplaced

1184
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Sensitive

1185
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Empathy

1186
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,943
C4 a weird lunatic reaching out to him

1187
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:38,271
Crying in pain I think that's the most generous

1188
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:43,647
Interpretation

1189
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:46,463
So here is how this report ends

1190
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Regardless of what

1191
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
We the people of America app

1192
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
The world

1193
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
What's happening

1194
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Wait why did you

1195
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
Say President Trump is a third-person I thought this was a warning to

1196
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,567
What's going on

1197
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,359
And we are going to

1198
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Continue to Edge

1199
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
UK others that

1200
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Aren't

1201
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
And we are going to continue to

1202
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,503
Politically and culturally and economically

1203
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
Spiritually

1204
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
Mobilize

1205
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,111
To stand against this one world government

1206
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Medical tyranny

1207
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Cashless Society

1208
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
Medical ID

1209

Social credit score carbon

1210
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
From being able to take over our lives

1211
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Dominator

1212
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
Convert US from

1213
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Interplay

00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
Regardless of what Trump

1215
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
We have already chosen

1216
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
To tell the truth

1217
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
How to take out

1218
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
Now Trump

1219
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,127
Japanese decide

1220
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Which side is

1221
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
The enemies of humanity

1222
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,183
There are secrets

1223
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Okay

1224
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:51,999
Call ride

1225
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,327
Opposed

1226
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:01,727
Hellboy made my greatest discovery yet

1227
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
So yeah I think

1228
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
In terms of trump picking site

1229
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,639
I think he has

1230
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Are you already chosen

1231
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,503
Believe them

1232
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
Shouldn't be forced to get it I guess

1233
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
I don't even know what what is he actually

1234
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Who care

1235
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,183
He's just saying bulshit out of his ass

1236
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
Always

1237
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,023
Is real strong

1238
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:31,423
Until here the visiting the message directed at Trump and that's affected empathy

1239
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,751
Still, like pretending you're talking directly to Trump it's just a

1240
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
Pathetic marketing ploy

1241
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,127
Make your audience feel like they're listening to something important to do putting it on the record

1242
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:42,687
Morality is talkingshit

1243
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:46,271
I'm quite like an open letter on a Blog with 1,000

1244
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,063
Subscribers today

1245
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,903
Bring home to whoever is getting that open letter

1246
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
So we leave the

1247
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,791
Going to say warm Waters of

1248
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
The Christmas

1249
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,655
Special hook

1250
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
Trying to threaten

1251
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,263
Trump into going along with his

1252
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,591
Agenda I will say it wasn't ringing ambassador

1253
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Bestway

1254
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
As far as Christmas special

1255
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:19,551
I mean the claymation was still in credit was this on the level of a Muppet Christmas Carol

1256
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,599
Oh absolutely not absolutely not

1257
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,415
So we get to the 29th

1258
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
Smile and

1259
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,511
The show starts out

1260
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,279
Hot

1261
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Hot

1262
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,375
Straight out blaming hot

1263
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
My mind is for my soul has

1264
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
Researching

1265
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Online

1266
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,623
On the phone and

1267
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
Just don't repeat

1268
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
I say that to give me the bad news

1269
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
We're dead already

1270
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Oh boy

1271
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Oh boy

1272
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,687
Alright okay

1273
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
Because I've read things

1274
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:25,599
Printed off of computers I got bad news I got bad news

1275
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
We're dead all

1276
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:33,535
Are we philosophically dead already like 11%

1277
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
Right

1278
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
Estimated that that's your question

1279
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
Hawaii

1280
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:45,055
What was the last thing I expected to be the follow-up to I do all this studying

1281
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,615
Little bit of a pause and then we're dead already

1282
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,711
Your aunt asked me what the philosophically dead thing at that like

1283
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
Alex does

1284
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,271
Clarify a little bit

1285
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,551
We're dead already

1286
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,671
I only say that

1287
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Boo

1288
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
Information for what's about to go down

1289
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,727
The question is how dad do you want to be

1290
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
See it is not the question

1291
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:21,919
It is kind of a philosophical death

1292
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Only mostly dead

1293
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,807
They're being gradient to death like

1294
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:34,207
I guess Alex thinks that your things are going bad you're like a quarter dead

1295
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,559
In a way you could describe

1296
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,583
Part of you is

1297
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,655
Is that more dead than

1298
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
Not

1299
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Or if you like have frostbite really bad frostbite at your guys or something

1300
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:55,455
I feel like maybe that's giving your foot

1301
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:01,855
Anthropomorphism that might not be okay

1302
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
I did

1303
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,183
Hear that from reset watch

1304
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
Not bad at all about it give you a sense of comfort to know that

1305
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
That whatever happens in the present

1306
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,311
Is it has already happened and you are already

1307
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
No

1308
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
I can tell

1309
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
I think a bit of it

1310
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,527
Is

1311
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Maybe understandable

1312
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,463
Maybe some of it is not and a little bit of comes down to some of his personal business

1313
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
That's being reported

1314
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,071
Times now

1315
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Almost 23

1316
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
2 years ago

1317
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,519
How many times have I said this is an organized

1318
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,567
Collapse of civilization

1319
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,359
And the destruction of

1320
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
Confidence

1321
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
In our government

1322
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,391
Institutions

1323
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Our family

1324
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,791
Word for word or

1325
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,631
Russian troops

1326
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,639
Number one story in the world

1327
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:35,039
Mixing up medication and blacking out and attaching herself police United

1328
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,207
Charter controller

1329
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,279
World

1330
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
Number one on Reddit

1331
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,863
Number one on Twitter

1332
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,399
Number one on Google

1333
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,935
Number one on Instagram

1334
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
Number one

1335
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
On Christmas Eve

1336
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,895
Because it makes the family

1337
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
Because it makes

1338
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Christmas

1339
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Because

1340
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
On the people

1341
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
Who really stupid

1342
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:15,999
Alex is a high-profile media figure so it's not really surprising there would be a ton of stories about his wife

1343
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,303
Getting arrested for domestic violence on Christmas

1344
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,655
Susan Bennett a con the family or Christmas

1345
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Conversation

1346
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,959
And it being about like his

1347
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
Grandiose ideas of his own murder.

1348
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,103
While I definitely don't agree with Alex about that nonsense

1349
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,175
I do think that people didn't do a great job with the story

1350
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:40,575
Hemet possibly there was a bit of schadenfreude the people were expressing at the idea of Alex being the target of domestic violence and I think that's

1351
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
It's not cool at all

1352
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
Making fun of victims of domestic violence

1353
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
Ghetto we understand is

1354
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Even if they're assholes that's

1355
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,279
Not appropriate and can easily result

1356
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
The shaming

1357
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
Stigmatizing in triggering those other Vic

1358
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,119
Absolutely

1359
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
Certainly a good enough reason

1360
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
M22 not play that game

1361
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,055
No without without all or any of the information because that's kind of

1362
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Of the point of my

1363
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:08,479
Station on the show about a dumb joke and then I read about it and deleted that.

1364
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
Dumb joke

1365
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,063
Christ I had no f****** clue I

1366
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,623
All I got was Alex got beat up

1367
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
Very funny to me

1368
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:18,463
Sure rest of it not funny

1369
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,095
Or any of the details

1370
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,679
I just reread it forces people

1371
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,983
To relive their own b******* and it's

1372
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,591
It's f***** up and I can appreciate that you know you taking

1373
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
Some sort of ownership and responsibilities of

1374
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,175
I'm having made a badge

1375
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,967
No interest in

1376
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
F*** that no

1377
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:46,111
Fun like about scolding

1378
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,695
I think that people who had far more information at their disposal

1379
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
Made decisions

1380
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
That was

1381
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,279
Something bad cover

1382
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:59,935
In a bit of a strange situation because I typically try to avoid covering things that are personal matters rally

1383
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
Bring his business out on the

1384
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
The streets

1385
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
Which makes me uncomfortable

1386
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,615
I thought about it and I'm not going to spend

1387
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
Time on the story unless it's

1388
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
Becomes like

1389
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
There's some sort of a major developed

1390
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Met with it

1391
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:17,599
I just wanted to bring it up here briefly to make sure the people don't think I haven't heard about it and send me 100 link

1392
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,903
Time-in publicly that I don't

1393
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
Support a fair amount of the coverage and commentary

1394
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,999
Because going on about this story

1395
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:30,655
Also some of the commentary that I don't support about it comes directly from Alex on his own show and that's kind of

1396
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,471
Tough for me to ignore and I hate I hate

1397
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,543
I hate this position not a good situation

1398
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Very

1399
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,895
You know my heart goes out to those

1400
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,919
Absolutely

1401
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
Absolutely

1402
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Spend time with

1403
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Is

1404
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
Stories

1405
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,111
And news and

1406
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
Lies

1407
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,183
Is that Alex tells about

1408
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
It's like a

1409
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
How old is incredible

1410
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
3% of people who died

1411
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:13,919
Just just just just bombshell after bombshell after bombshell after bombshell

1412
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:17,503
Was just another thing that Alex was pulling from Steve kirsch's stubs

1413
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
Disposed

1414
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Dogshit

1415
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,343
Isabella study the

1416
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,207
Apparently found because Michael you Don sent him a link to a bitchute video about it

1417
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,583
Is there a non peer-reviewed paper which was published by a group called doctors for covid FL

1418
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,191
Because anti-vax Outlet leaning heavily in the direction of saying that the vaccines are a weapon

1419
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,823
Doctors for covid ethics should be very much another red flag of like

1420
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,663
Anunnaki was named hiding the most obvious evil

1421
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,479
What are the founding signatories of the group is Michael G.

1422
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
Who sent Steve Kerr's the paper

1423
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
And of course

1424
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:57,439
One of the other founding signatories of the group is superhit bhakti who's one of the two researchers credited in

1425
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
In this paper

1426
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,351
Is it clearly unverified piece of work being done by an ATV X Outlet being masqueraded as an actual

1427
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
You're mistaking it it's clearly

1428
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Synergy

1429
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,447
Jesus

1430
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
I believe that

1431
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,751
This isn't a study at all

1432
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,079
If anything it's an attempt at a persuasive essay

1433
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
From the paper

1434
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,479
We here with present scientific evidence that calls for an immediate stop to the use of G Bass

1435
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Covid-19 vaccine

1436
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:26,111
Reverse layout why the agents cannot protect against viral infection

1437
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:33,023
If this were actually a legitimate study about whether or not deaths that occurred after vaccinations were caused by the vaccination

1438
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,095
It wouldn't necessarily be a topic there was germane to the paper

1439
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,167
This is anti-vax advocacy which is

1440
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:44,799
Rising because it was written by an advocate pushed on another anti-vax Advocates Subs

1441
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
It's almost

1442
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,919
It's almost nice of them to lay out there conflict of interest

1443
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Up-top

1444
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,735
Harem

1445
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,551
We're going to tell you what b*******

1446
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
And then give you the b*******

1447
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,439
What does completely on verify paper did was

1448
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
15.

1449
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:07,071
Send it claims to Don histopathological analysis on their organs boo

1450
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,631
There's literally no data provider

1451
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:15,519
Even so that the vaccines caused these people to have heart attack

1452
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,311
Honestly I'm just

1453
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,079
Guessing that that's

1454
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,639
What's the point because the cause of death of for these people

1455
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
Aren't even list

1456
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,991
Just that 14 out of the 15 had hearts that were effect

1457
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:29,087
Didn't Subway that they do for their predetermined conclusion

1458
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,975
The closest you get to data is a list of some demographic information about the people whose organs they allege

1459
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
The analyze

1460
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
One of them was he knighted

1461
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:41,375
85 year old woman who died 68 days after getting the vaccine

1462
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,935
She's almost 100 years old there's over two months

1463
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
Between

1464
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,495
My first thought is this seems a little thin

1465
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:52,895
Similarly there's another patient with an 89 year old woman who died six months after getting the vaccine

1466
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:59,551
People in their subject Pool died of an unknown number of days after vaccinations know when they got back

1467
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,647
Well you don't need to know Dan you know that the vaccines evil

1468
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Two of them

1469
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
I don't even know which

1470
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Vaccine they got

1471
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
They got a vaccine

1472
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
Maybe it was the MMR vaccine you don't know

1473
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,447
This isn't the study isn't never pass any kind of critical review

1474
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:22,335
There are other doctors and researchers doing histological examinations on people who have died after vaccinations

1475
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,151
They are coming up with anything close to this kind of result in

1476
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,431
Generally those papers

1477
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,711
Actually have data

1478
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
And aren't just like

1479
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:34,367
I think you got a busted couple months ago bad

1480
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,647
Real bad

1481
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,463
Come on real real bad stuff

1482
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
Here

1483
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,839
I do I do like like a sofen

1484
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
So dumb

1485
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
And like

1486
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Steve Kerr

1487
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,471
Is out there promoting it as if it's like

1488
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
This proves

1489
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,615
93% of people who died after getting the vaccine is so funny to me

1490
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
That if you're going

1491
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
To cherry-pick

1492
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:03,295
Take that bad they're still there doing the 97% for voted for Putin think they're like

1493
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
Listen 14 out of 50

1494
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,903
I'm not going to say that everybody to get the vaccine

1495
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,439
We all know that would be

1496
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Flight clarification

1497
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:16,607
It's 93% of people who do die afterwards it was

1498
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Because of

1499
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,239
93% of people who get the vaccine dying would be

1500
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,383
People I always at I have more difficult time is like this is

1501
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663
Is the thinnest of soups

1502
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
And

1503
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
It's just

1504
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,015
Yet another in a long

1505
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,903
String of thin soups that are being presented by Steve Kerr

1506
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,719
He's going to get to try again

1507
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,767
People are going to be like shut up man

1508
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
Homeopathic

1509
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,583
Broth

1510
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
It's so thin

1511
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Yeah

1512
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:49,887
It's

1513
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,447
I want a little bit more I want

1514
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:57,823
Chunky Soup

1515
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,663
I don't want to chili I'm talking about a good stew

1516
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,455
I do want to chill out

1517
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,855
Navigate to dog you love being generally

1518
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,135
Does chili yeah

1519
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
New York

1520
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:16,767
I do not like paper copy

1521
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,559
But this is the end of civilization

1522
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,423
And we know that because Alex has a lot of stacks of news

1523
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
No

1524
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,287
This is the end of civilization as you know it

1525
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:34,175
Score on eras of blessing

1526
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Trying to scare you

1527
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
I love you

1528
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
For what

1529
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:54,143
We are in the middle of the New World Order we're in the middle of the mark of the beast tank up we are in the middle

1530
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,871
This is one stack here

1531
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
You're out of

1532
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,711
123456789 10 11 12

1533
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:20,767
31 stacks

1534
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,631
Impossible

1535
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
Buzz Marketing for Baskin-Robbins

1536
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,567
Yeah I would say

1537
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,127
Congratulations reproving you know how to

1538
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
Workout that's good

1539
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:42,015
Yeah I would like independent confirmation on there being actually 31 stack

1540
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:49,695
I didn't watch the video but I believe it I see how much paper he generally has all the bat

1541
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,511
Obscene

1542
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
More sure there's 31's text of articles

1543
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,655
In front of you

1544
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
Who cares

1545
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,775
Yeah there's too much to cover agreed

1546
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
Just do one well

1547
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
Yes do what

1548
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,127
One-story well

1549
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,151
Stay on topic

1550
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,943
Digging into the details

1551
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
That's your job

1552
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
I can't trust

1553
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,807
Rescue with one piece of paper let alone with a stack of

1554
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:20,671
You got to earn

1555
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,511
Semantically connected

1556
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,143
He might as well be just grabbing random I find the grouping of stacks

1557
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,167
Tubi

1558
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
Chaotic

1559
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
Yeah and

1560
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
Just random

1561
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,543
A large number

1562
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,567
Go with flash card

1563
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
Flashcards are the way to go cuz we know that most of those pieces of paper at most have a tweet on them

1564
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
I agree but my point is this yes

1565
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
There are Thirty-One snacks paper

1566
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:54,719
But it's arbitrary why any of them that is one stack of paper

1567
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
Yeah

1568
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:01,631
That is just one big old stack

1569
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:08,031
Is there any label on the stack like this is the this is the lies stack this is the other all the lights.

1570
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Zoomer stackin

1571
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,871
So here we go. We're going to get into the first

1572
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
Stacks

1573
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:30,559
Golden tsunami will drive Health Systems towards collapse who we need trillions we need you

1574
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
You in control

1575
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,471
Healthcare system has collapsed

1576
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Okay

1577
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,663
The best Healthcare System

1578
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,183
So this was a story this fact is beasts of the stack

1579
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:03,071
Actually really get into the actual article at any greater detail than he just did that

1580
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:08,447
Maybe the story that was taken from the ASP newswire but I can tell that Alex is reading this headline

1581
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,775
From when it was posted on ndtv.com

1582
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,335
Is the new site primarily about India

1583
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
India news

1584
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,199
Screenplays for him to get ahead a little bit.

1585
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
You might have to have gone looking

1586
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:25,855
Anyway the underline article doesn't say anything about needing tons of funding or that the UN

1587
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
To take over in a

1588
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
Nevada Healthcare System

1589
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,767
Just got out of a sad list of things that countries are trying to do to limit the spread of infection

1590
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
As the looming

1591
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,375
Hospitals being completely overwhelmed

1592
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:43,775
Germany shutting down nightclubs and grease band music and bars and restaurants until January

1593
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
16th

1594
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,591
Had to like that kind of

1595
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
Hey listen we're not going to close down bars

1596
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:55,551
But I am close down to hang out

1597
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:01,695
Itself actually written by mdtv which is clearly stated on their website

1598
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,303
Except the headline this story has not been edited by NDTV

1599
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,095
Hades published from a syndicated

1600
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:08,863
Feed

1601
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,423
All Alex operates off is

1602
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:16,031
Because the stuff that he's saying never really has anything to do with the body of the Articles he covers

1603
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:22,431
So actually in reality what he's doing is basically creating an entire narrative based on the editorial decisions of an

1604
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,247
Indian news website that he probably doesn't even know exist

1605
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,551
This is fascinating levels of stupid

1606
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
Yeah

1607
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,135
Because here it's just basically on headlines

1608
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,231
Who knows who wrote most of these headlines

1609
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
It's almost

1610
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:40,095
A fascinating glimpse into something that I would never have

1611
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Thought of

1612
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,167
Like that idea of just

1613
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
God I need

1614
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Someone

1615
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,543
Else to write the thing that I want to rip off of

1616
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
So I'm just going to go dig

1617
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:58,527
Maybe or maybe it's just the first one they found

1618
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
Yeah

1619
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
You're just going to be able

1620
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
Ball on it

1621
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,535
Bryant what you're doing

1622
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,327
Is really just using

1623
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:15,167
The basis of Fitbit editors website

1624
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,703
Evidence of the globalist

1625
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
Plans what is

1626
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
Ridiculous send them

1627
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Sunflowers are

1628
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
If you did that with all the people he lied about

1629
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,967
You'd be running out of job

1630
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,575
Will you be in chocolate shortage have to deal with Raptors anymore

1631
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,159
The Raptors

1632
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,511
He's going to read all the stank

1633
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:47,423
It is about right here we go

1634
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:59,199
Real quick it's really awesome that he's playing the mission impossible

1635
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
Impossible mission isn't working

1636
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,183
And yet some of the most insane gaslighting ever

1637
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,743
This pack will self-destruct some of the most

1638
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,023
Insane Gaslight Iver

1639
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
Bill Gates and Anderson Cooper

1640
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:23,007
Take away people's Social Security that don't take the injections

1641
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Clear as day

1642
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,151
Warriors run by Pfizer

1643
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,199
Real

1644
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:38,367
Again we all know they got all over TV saying don't let you leave your house take your kids away

1645
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:45,023
It's really pretty amazing to me that Alexandra thinks that if he's able to read off all the headlines and his Stacks that isn't turn 24

1646
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
Printed out for him that's going to be an accomplishment

1647
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Or that it will have proven anything

1648
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:55,775
It's interesting in a way like it might be fun to play some Wagers about whether or not he gets through them but ultimately

1649
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
Who cares

1650
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:00,383
Most of the headlines are going to be about the same story from different websites

1651
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,687
Like how the NDTV article is just a

1652
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Aafp story with an in-house head

1653
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
It's going to be most of

1654
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
What he's got the cover

1655
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:14,207
Raiders did do a fact-check of claims we're going around on social media that Anderson Cooper wanted to take away Social Security from people who didn't

1656
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,511
That claim is not true

1657
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,815
Who's part of a question that he was posing

1658
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
Into Bill Gates because it was

1659
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
An interview like is this something

1660
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:25,983
Should be done weird though because

1661
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,847
You know who really wants to take away Social Security from everybody whether they're vaccinated or not

1662
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,503
Every politician Alex's ever supported those people usually yeah

1663
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,855
2 is it's a dangerous precedent for Alex to be f****** around with where

1664
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
He believes that in a journalist asking the question is the same thing as them advancing opposition because I

1665
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,655
I would like to point to his entire career where he actually does do that quite a bit

1666
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,679
Things that he might be bi

1667
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,215
Getting sued over

1668
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:03,615
So also Alex is making up advisor owns Reuters because

1669
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,431
I like it's something he probably slept past the audience

1670
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:11,039
Riders is owned by Thomson Reuters corporation which is majority-owned by the Woodbridge

1671
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,879
Pfizer has its own company and has nothing to do with these other entities

1672
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,207
It's just as a board member of Pfizer

1673
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
It's just it

1674
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,511
I mean

1675
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:26,911
When you have so many parent companies and subsidiaries and this guy is on the board of this and on the board of that

1676
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:32,031
You can tell somebody oh this is owned by some company and there's like

1677
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
I can't look into it and it might be so f******

1678
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,895
I don't know

1679
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
Your mission

1680
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,759
Should I choose with something

1681
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,343
Is to read your sack never let's dig into the stacks

1682
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,903
You always start on my right side cuz it's always the

1683
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Stop

1684
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,303
Let's just do something different over here

1685
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,311
Rodger science

1686
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
Question is

1687
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,063
I'm pushing vaccines

1688
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,647
Rx-3 headlines

1689
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:23,487
No time spent on any of these stories whatsoever here's the breakdown

1690
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:30,143
What headline is about dropping of vaccine mandates in New York with Alex should be in favor of and kind of undercut some of his own men

1691
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Ameritas

1692
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,959
But how they're going to force iPhone to get back

1693
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,007
Specifically he said that they were going

1694
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,335
Divorce every one to get the vaccine in this example is it people not force

1695
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,407
Some people to get the backseat this out of the stack

1696
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,223
Yeah it doesn't really help

1697
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:50,623
The next to the comment but science from football player Aaron Rodgers which Alex doesn't think is going far enough so

1698
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:57,023
Escalated for the Packers in touchdowns thrown

1699
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:02,143
You got to trust them on the side is also third on the science list the Packers history

1700
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,935
Shannon Sharpe

1701
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:07,263
Whether I can think of other Packers player

1702
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,591
Football was never one of my

1703
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,663
I think number one is obviously Lombardi himself Favre

1704
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Bar was

1705
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Barbies

1706
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:22,111
Play for the Packers just making sure

1707
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,415
I told you what

1708
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:28,767
And then the third headline that Alex has to be rounded out with him

1709
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,303
Tentatively giving it up to ram

1710
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
Pause

1711
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,887
This is this is the tip

1712
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,983
Hey Rand Paul said something

1713
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
The end

1714
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
Play for others

1715
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
Go to write

1716
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,639
Slater on his career play for the Vikings

1717
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,711
See that's that might have been where I got any play for Wrangler

1718
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:52,831
Keyblade for sending pictures of your dick B

1719
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:54,879
Another headline

1720
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,159
Here's a big

1721
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,279
Heavens-above NASA English priest prepare

1722
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,423
Father next big deals

1723
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
Dismiss reporting this story because he

1724
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
Just read the headline

1725
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:27,392
Who's the story that was making the rounds recently but text about a program that was called societal implications of estradiol

1726
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,696
Ecology which ran from 2015 to 2018

1727
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:34,816
The idea was that there was a bunch of religious Scholars and they'd meet up at the center for

1728
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
Inquiry at Princeton University

1729
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:40,448
Discuss how religious communities would respond to the discovery of alien life

1730
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
It should that ever happen

1731
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,824
The reason that there were headlines about this recently is because one of the theologian

1732
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,872
Reverend Andrew Davison

1733
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:51,968
He's publishing a book about his experience child astrobiology and Krista

1734
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Doctor

1735
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
Apparently it's takeaway was quote

1736
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,392
The headline findings are that adherence of a range of religious Traditions report that they

1737
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,440
You can take that idea in their stride

1738
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:06,304
That did the idea of aliens being a threat to religious beliefs

1739
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
Is over rest

1740
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:12,192
I mean do you know in a certain he's kind

1741
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
And if saying listen we can rack

1742
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
Get the f*** out

1743
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,336
I think it was

1744
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
Made a similar comment

1745
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Number of years back about

1746
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,552
A week out there ways

1747
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,832
Is that you can incorporate

1748
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,136
It's no different than

1749
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:37,536
The original Church suddenly finding out that there were Aboriginal people in Australia

1750
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:44,192
It's how can they be subject to the same original sin if they've literally never heard

1751
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Heard of this b*******

1752
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,056
Do some challenges just the illogic

1753
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Bickley of

1754
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
If there are

1755
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
Aliens on another planet

1756
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,712
Did Jesus die for their say exactly

1757
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:01,600
And I wasn't there at the center for theological inquiry

1758
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,880
These people are

1759
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Obviously

1760
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,952
Experts in their fields

1761
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,792
If the takeaway for this dude who is there is that

1762
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,096
Play we can handle this mean it is

1763
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:15,168
I think of word for it

1764
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,752
And I know they would find it very sacrilegious for me to describe it as such but

1765
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:22,336
It's a little bit like a writer's room for how are we going to deal with this

1766
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:30,784
How much of a workshop World talk about ideas like how do we feel about this

1767
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,136
Like a they have the priest

1768
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:38,464
Paraphernalia discovery

1769
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
It's not God pretty

1770
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
From lasers

1771
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,864
Hugo based on the headline that's the way you could report the story

1772
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
If you read into what is actually going on

1773
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,472
It's about preparing for alien discovery

1774
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:52,288
Societal implications

1775
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,592
Also Project Blue beam isn't a real thing

1776
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:59,456
It was a wacky conspiracy theory a dude named Serge monast popular lies back in the 90s

1777
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,528
What you probably crib from some stories written by Jean rotten

1778
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:10,208
I like this game that we're playing though I was active

1779
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:15,328
It's very it's a great game like it would make me feel good you get that nice little bit of

1780
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,472
Endorphin rush just like that I'm right again and it's fascinating that like at the end of it he probably is like

1781
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,800
Damn it I was efficient today

1782
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:31,456
Productive I read so many had lied you really would have to be a narcissist to enjoy the

1783
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
That though

1784
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,600
Because it's a kind of like that Twilight Zone episode where if you always win at gambling

1785
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
It's boring

1786
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,464
Only if you're a narcissist and you always win at being right

1787
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,000
It never stops being fun

1788
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,840
I don't think I look that much

1789
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:52,704
You might be having a bad time

1790
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,008
Possible ready for another stack yeah

1791
01:23:57,056 --> 01:24:02,176
Get out of here

1792
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,712
Anomaly on Twitter

1793
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
Exercise

1794
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
Was it a screenshot or did he type it out

1795
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,256
That's what I wouldn't know was a screenshot

1796
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
10 point Arial font

1797
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:24,704
Screenshot he probably black and white highlighter

1798
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
Somewhere omigod

1799
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
God this is dumb one of those

1800
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,128
What a terrible idea

1801
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:39,040
Treating the top articles

1802
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,112
One of the future this is it

1803
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:47,744
Interesting story and it's definitely a headline Alex can use to rinse out all sorts of nonsense but

1804
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
Especially not his nightmarish is the headline mites

1805
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:50,816
Suggest

1806
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:54,912
There's a program in China if it's been trained to use an over 17,000

1807
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,984
Some cases to be able to take a description of a particular case

1808
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,312
And determine if it fits the requirements of a specific crime

1809
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,920
Currently it's only able to recognize the eight most common crimes that occur in

1810
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
Shanghai

1811
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,552
But obviously overtime as technology progresses you'd expect that number to go up

1812
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:18,208
The Project Lead scientist Professor shiyang was clear that the AI doesn't take part in any of the actual decision

1813
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,792
About whether or not to file charges or come up with sentences

1814
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,072
That's all done by humans

1815
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,096
It's cuz I process

1816
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,632
Goes into those sorts of determination

1817
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Far more complicated

1818
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,960
Did the capability to do

1819
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Their reason

1820
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
To be concerned about the possible ways this

1821
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Could go wrong but Alex's coverage

1822
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Weigh-off

1823
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,664
And it's generous for me to even call this coverage

1824
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,456
If you don't go into any detail about this

1825
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
Read the headline at make

1826
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
Shut up

1827
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,880
Constantly this is this is a little bit like

1828
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,608
Everyone if all the varsity varsity

1829
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,680
The next level players are all out

1830
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,728
They at they're all out sick

1831
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:07,616
It's like it's like an angry person who's not good at improv right

1832
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Don't understand

1833
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,760
Top article out of each.

1834
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
Let's continue

1835
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
Winterdays

1836
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Headline

1837
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,184
Infowars.com

1838
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,840
Who warns of global Healthcare collapse that they triggered with covid hysteria mean

1839
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,144
Wild Bill Gates and fellow blue blood

1840
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,680
Anderson Cooper

1841
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,448
Promote

1842
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
Social security for Americans

1843
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:38,080
Who refused the deadly gene therapy injections

1844
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,408
Broadcast

1845
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,224
That's not party headlines

1846
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,016
Expose the latest

1847
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,576
Covid-19 developments including the fact

1848
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,136
93% of people who died

1849
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,256
One of the stacks was a tweet

1850
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,792
This stack

1851
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
The printout of the Infowars page

1852
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
It has an embedded video of the show that Alex is

1853
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Currently recording

1854
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
Yeah

1855
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,264
What is going on I don't know

1856
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
Such a waste of paper

1857
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,592
I do like how we move the goalposts

1858
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,944
From I'm going to read all these texts to I'm reading the top one of each of these decks

1859
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,904
When I was with comes back he has

1860
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,696
What's the what you know what the most

1861
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Important

1862
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
Sing it

1863
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
This critical

1864
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,656
You need to understand

1865
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,776
Cogitate to reflect

1866
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
To really

1867
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,848
Assess

1868
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,200
I've everything I've got her in front of me

1869
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,016
Just because you don't want to miss the forest for the trees

1870
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,512
Problem is not Klaus Schwab

1871
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
He's not Bill Gates

1872
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
Our problem is not Ted Turner

1873
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
Or George Soros

1874
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,080
Problem

1875
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,944
Problem

1876
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,248
He's not even Donald Trump

1877
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,576
The problem is not

1878
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,392
Give six morgue

1879
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
Problem is

1880
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
Because we're not

1881
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:37,120
Making the people that are on the fence that we've elected to be our Representatives

1882
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
Our Guardians

1883
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,680
Damn jobs

1884
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Yes

1885
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,728
It is your fault

1886
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:46,336
You have not convince people of the dumb premises

1887
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:51,456
You got it help solutely

1888
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
Don't give a s*** about you

1889
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:04,000
Google's everything you say is a lie or manipulation right

1890
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,048
Yes you have failed to convince

1891
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,608
A large portion of the public

1892
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
And

1893
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,656
The elected leaders

1894
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,192
That you think have your back

1895
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:15,264
Who are using you for an easy voting

1896
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:22,688
I think he's learning the wrong

1897
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,016
Should I double down

1898
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,832
It's actually I think the lesson that he's getting

1899
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,600
2 is

1900
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
Christmas miracle

1901
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,512
Does not give a s***

1902
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,048
About his warnings

1903
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,352
Is a Christmas miracle

1904
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
Compass give a s***

1905
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,960
I think Alex is just trying to adjust his expectations

1906
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,288
Move things over to Rand Paul a little bit

1907
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,920
He knows gene therapy

1908
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,712
And he still

1909
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:59,552
Not attacking was shot he just said hey instead of saying the shot

1910
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,904
People really need vitamins vitamin D

1911
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,632
It really a hundred percent

1912
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,312
Grandpa's not doing that and so

1913
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:24,384
About this this morning about 5 a.m.

1914
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:32,320
Then I thought

1915
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,880
Super smart

1916
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,816
He knows damn well what's going on so

1917
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,608
Let me say this

1918
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:50,752
I said Trump's either super ignorant or one of the most evil man to ever live do this to his own people

1919
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
He's lying to himself

1920
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:02,272
Regardless

1921
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:13,280
No I don't want to break his ribs I don't want to shoot at him like a Democrat does

1922
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,864
For president someday

1923
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,472
But whatever calculus he's got

1924
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,288
Masses going on his head

1925
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
So

1926
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
I want to apologize to President Trump

1927
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Oh God

1928
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,096
Yeah I just get the Santa's like alright

1929
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,192
This Joe Rogan treatment for Trump isn't going to work

1930
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,984
Maybe I can bully rampaul

1931
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:59,360
It's like a halftime show to basketball game where there like okay

1932
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:04,736
You win $1000000 if you can make this half court shot you miss it okay you win

1933
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,296
$50 if you can make this three-point shot

1934
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:12,672
You miss it okay you win you win $5 if you make this free throw you know what else it's like

1935
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:19,328
Setting up to read all the headlines

1936
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:25,728
About 54 president

1937
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,264
Didn't work I'm going to go ahead and

1938
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,336
Talk to you about Rand Paul

1939
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:34,944
Derek from my grocery store will not condemn the vaccines

1940
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,784
Serious problem from the grocery store has

1941
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:45,696
Quite a bit of sway

1942
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:50,560
Wrong Derek from the grocery store he's going to cut your meat too thick at the deli

1943
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:56,448
People cannot have that the manager that groceries

1944
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,728
He's great power

1945
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
He's a great guy so Alex

1946
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,616
This talking about like this this like alright maybe we should do at a game

1947
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
You make some metaphor

1948
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
It's weird

1949
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,808
Compares

1950
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
The

1951
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:13,856
Bullying

1952
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
The politician

1953
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,696
We're getting these politicians to fight the globalist for

1954
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,488
Haha is similar

1955
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,792
2 when he was a kid that someone stole his bike

1956
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,608
His dad going over to talk to that kid's dad

1957
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Okay so your

1958
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,936
You're telling me

1959
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
That he's boiling

1960
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,056
Global politics down to my dad could beat up your

1961
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,848
Bingo

1962
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,408
How do we stop this how do we

1963
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:44,320
Focus on Biden the puppet we focus on Bill Gates what's he done

1964
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,112
Go after

1965
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,768
If I was 67 years old

1966
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:59,424
Bully from down the street was like 14

1967
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,728
Michael wake me off of it

1968
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:12,224
Why are you telling a story

1969
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:18,624
Real quick we got to recognize this started as a hypothetical acknowledgement

1970
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,208
It happened very well be like if this happened

1971
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
And my dad just said

1972
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
You're going to give me that bike right now

1973
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
Listen.

1974
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
Point was is that

1975
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
This is basically

1976
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,952
Exactly what you would expect in terms of Alex's belief of his relation

1977
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
2

1978
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:59,328
Itule battles

1979
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,608
Fight for him

1980
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:05,472
I mean that's that's kind of an apt way to describe any

1981
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,032
Desire for a paternalistic

1982
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,848
God-king I wanted Daddy

1983
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:15,456
Think it's exactly how I do think there's something to be said for pressuring elected leaders

1984
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,736
Do

1985
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,040
Policy sets that are more in line with

1986
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:25,696
Know what you'd help and I mean a good example of that Jen sake comes out and it's like f*** you will never send you a test and then

1987
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:28,512
Couple weeks later they like okay fine we're going to send you a bunch of tests

1988
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:31,072
Sorry it turns out we sounded like they assholes

1989
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,608
Yeah there's there's public

1990
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,680
Pressure that you can make theirs

1991
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
Do you know

1992
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,728
Around yourself

1993
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,800
Primary somebody already

1994
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,104
There are things that are much more

1995
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:45,152
Productive productive

1996
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,200
Mature relationships

1997
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,760
With our childish

1998
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Sonship with

1999
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,576
Elected leaders NFL

2000
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
And how Alex

2001
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,648
Cease all these pieces fitting together

2002
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,672
That's not surprised

2003
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
It's just

2004
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,792
Weird that he articulates it this way

2005
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,072
Whereas

2006
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:08,192
He describes our elected leaders similar to father

2007
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,008
I see our elected leaders as being a bunch of patches

2008
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,592
Children with a lot of money arguing with each other about stuff that doesn't matter

2009
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,616
Well they watch us die

2010
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,688
I think that you're closer

2011
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,016
Maybe not not full on but

2012
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:24,576
Alex's decided

2013
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,880
Rand Paul maybe is a better Target

2014
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928
Doesn't mean

2015
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,464
Not going to still try and

2016
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:36,352
I get that juice out of trouble

2017
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,192
He doesn't know what's going on

2018
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,104
Attention

2019
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,272
Megan from Rochester

2020
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,576
You know what I'm going to do

2021
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Not bad guy

2022
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,752
What he's doing he's surrounded by bad advisors

2023
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,800
He's got that

2024
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:23,200
Multimillion-dollar social media network based on Mastodon

2025
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:29,088
SEC network

2026
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:39,072
What was the successful businessman

2027
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,608
This is weird

2028
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:47,264
Started with him saying we need to move on from Trump state of doing that he's like I want to get his attention by talking

2029
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,824
Shiting dishing dirt

2030
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,664
Way to move on from Trump would be to reveal all of the s*** they

2031
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,248
That you've already known about him for the years that you've been lying about

2032
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:02,624
Anything meaningful said he could repeal

2033
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,024
Probably not grifter for the past our entire lives

2034
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,048
Cuz they don't get their way

2035
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,888
The news about the SEC looking into Trump social media Venture broke about like a

2036
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,936
Like a month ago Outlets

2037
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,216
All over the place

2038
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,008
Seem like as counters

2039
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:23,872
I guess next out in the show will see if Alex building T but

2040
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,152
Spoiler alert

2041
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,456
That's not the

2042
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,296
Weak attempt at the Rogan treatment it's

2043
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Not going to work

2044
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,160
Like Alex take your own advice move on

2045
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,720
I think bullying Paul's a great idea

2046
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:42,048
He seems like a worm I love bullying Grandpa

2047
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,776
Burlington roll over and show you his belly all the time

2048
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:58,176
It was on your show like 100 f****** time

2049
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:07,392
Move on from dropping at

2050
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,440
When on vacation

2051
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,536
A picture taken of him and Alex wants to talk about that

2052
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
Mary is vacationing

2053
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,448
In his native state

2054
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:25,824
And hanging his wife with a dog wearing mask alone on the beach

2055
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,152
Totally to create fear

2056
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Hysteria

2057
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,088
Solutely

2058
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,624
But things are so dangerous

2059
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:41,184
President of the United States

2060
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,000
Beachfront property

2061
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,816
With his new German Shepherd puppy they killed the last one

2062
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,120
Po-boy

2063
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,912
Breathe the air

2064
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:55,264
Alex's referring Biden's dog champ there who died back in June

2065
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,664
I think Alex might need to substantiate the claim that biking killed his dog for a particularly considering the champ was 12 years old which is

2066
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,736
No typically on the high end of normal dog lifespan

2067
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:10,880
Sphere pictures of Biden wearing a mask don't rank anywhere near what Alex does everyday

2068
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,208
Plus you have to understand how this is a rigged game

2069
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,304
The mask and Alex can say it's a dishonest photo-op meant to Sprint

2070
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
Spread

2071
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,376
Fighting doesn't wear the mask and Alex

2072
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
I can say it's a

2073
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,680
Example of liberal hypocrisy

2074
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,496
How do you have to wear the mask but Lord Biden does

2075
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,032
Games where it's at

2076
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,312
Doesn't matter

2077
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,336
Meaningless

2078
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
There's no like

2079
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,640
There's no compromise

2080
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:38,272
Which it seems should have been very obvious in so many other avenues as well

2081
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:42,112
We had likes a negotiating over a bill with Republican

2082
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,184
Kids whenever you obviously know they're all going to vote no on it any

2083
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
Anyways

2084
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,280
Statement of we will do nothing

2085
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
I will

2086
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:53,120
Never ever sit a Supreme Court Justice

2087
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,424
During the final year of a present

2088
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:02,848
Did everybody knows it out with people who have explicitly made it clear they have no interest in negotiating

2089
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,616
Naro

2090
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,944
And engagement

2091
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480
It's fairly similar

2092
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,576
That's going to go into effect

2093
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,856
Guarding the Border

2094
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Ranbaxy

2095
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
Really whiffs

2096
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,976
On this one

2097
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:26,656
Illegal

2098
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,960
Not the migrants but anybody

2099
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Aussie

2100
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
See how that works

2101
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:49,696
Is a great example of how stupid Alex is and how his laziness Translate

2102
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:54,560
If you just read the headline of this article you might come away with some of the conclusions Alex comes to

2103
01:41:55,072 --> 01:42:01,216
You need to be super xenophobic bigot and you'd still have to make up a few details but this is within the realm of imagination if you donate

2104
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
Play look at the

2105
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,520
The policy of the article at all

2106
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:06,848
From u.s. News & World Report article on policy

2107
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,408
The rules pertaining to non us measure

2108
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:13,248
American citizens and permanent residents may still enter the US

2109
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,296
Regardless of their vaccination status

2110
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:18,880
Alex legitimately and literally lied

2111
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:22,720
Making up that US citizens

2112
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:26,560
Doing so helps him create a feeling of animosity in his audience towards Emig

2113
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:32,704
Becomes even more flagrant as an instance of misreporting when you realize that this is a month old story

2114
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
He's at

2115
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,776
Plenty of time to hear about it look into it

2116
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,872
Get the details down particularly considering I was about 10 hours of research a day

2117
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Also

2118
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,760
Shooting in October 2021 the CDC and the state department announced new guidelines

2119
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:50,880
Require all immigrant Visa applicants to receive a full covid-19 vaccine series

2120
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:53,952
As part of the medical exam prior to being issued a Visa

2121
01:42:55,232 --> 01:43:00,608
The guidelines specifically say that if a Visa applicant refuses to get vaccinated they are quote inadmissible to the United

2122
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,376
Midstates

2123
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:07,520
Most of the undocumented immigrants in the country or people have overstayed their visas and even if there were black mostly folks

2124
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:12,896
Sneaking into the country a rule that they needed to be vaccinated would be totally meaningless and unenforceable

2125
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:16,736
What's mean expressed here is Alex's laziness willingness

2126
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,040
The lie and his blanket hatred of immigrants

2127
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,088
Nothing meaningful here at all

2128
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:21,856
No

2129
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
Just bigotry

2130
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,488
Let's just talk a little bigotry in their otherwise people won't kind of get that

2131
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:28,512
Vibe you know

2132
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:34,912
How to make sure you're just reading through bunch of stacks you don't really have the opportunity to wax on bigotry

2133
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:39,008
Away from the exactly so you got to find a way to slam it in there

2134
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:43,360
So we lost a Harry Reid recently react

2135
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:49,760
Okay love you a lot of different feelings about Harry Reid and that's not not a conversation we need to get into at this point

2136
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:52,320
But Alex has a

2137
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:55,136
The weird kind of insulting eulogy

2138
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,440
Okay

2139
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,512
To become

2140
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,096
And all for just money and power in the system

2141
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:07,680
You know Harry Reid very corrupt evil Chinese Asian

2142
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:08,704
Okay

2143
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,456
She could have been a real human

2144
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:26,112
Very very very very very

2145
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
Is it

2146
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,208
Let me get these articles right now

2147
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,048
What just happened

2148
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,096
So weird

2149
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:39,424
I think like I understand like dancing on a grave

2150
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,984
If you're Alex

2151
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,056
I kind of also understand being like what a loss

2152
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,080
Is a Statesman

2153
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:49,408
You know I can understand that response to

2154
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:54,784
It's very difficult is what Alex just did like what a shame he's dead we could have been a human

2155
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,880
But he was a Chinese spy

2156
01:44:59,136 --> 01:44:59,904
Who's died

2157
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,440
What

2158
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
I don't know

2159
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,256
What I was very confused okay

2160
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,888
So Alex

2161
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:14,240
Has Steve Kerr Sean for the last hour mostly talk about this

2162
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,032
Substack post that he has

2163
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,312
That is full of s***

2164
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,896
Royal isn't much of it there's only a few clips

2165
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
It's dumb

2166
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,528
Here's Alex's introduction

2167
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:41,376
Computer science engineer shop multimillion-dollar

2168
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,496
Subject

2169
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:51,104
Huge huge article

2170
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,224
We also posted infowars.com pathology results show

2171
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,272
93% of people

2172
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,368
Who died after being killed by the vaccine

2173
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
So I'm flabbergasted

2174
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,464
Because the underlying document here is

2175
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,816
4 pages long and honestly it's really a bar like three in terms of actual text

2176
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,608
The video presentation

2177
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,400
Babies LinkedIn the article is

2178
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:19,520
15 minutes long and a half

2179
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,824
You know

2180
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,592
Break I guess

2181
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,896
Also because it's funny I want to point out the

2182
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:29,248
First sentence in the video presentation that's linked to this non study is quote

2183
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,624
I want to say first of all that we must not quibble about details

2184
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:44,608
Alright let's not get bogged down with all the facts or whatever

2185
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:51,008
Picture might be America perfect opening her presentation

2186
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,056
Elderly devoid of detail

2187
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,336
In any case if you

2188
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:56,896
Curious there is no data presented in

2189
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,664
Video

2190
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
This is Akin

2191
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:02,528
Completely meaningless thing I could be ignored out of

2192
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:08,928
Until actual concrete evidences provided it by that I mean that I'm going to quibble about the details

2193
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
You're not supposed to do

2194
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,512
Yes I'll I think the reason for that is if

2195
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,280
Equivalent method

2196
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Details

2197
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
The details would look real dumb

2198
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,400
This is

2199
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,704
That's clip and they're talking about

2200
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
Robert Malone

2201
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
Just got a part of Alex's Christmas

2202
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Message

2203
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,104
He

2204
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,920
Apparently has been booked on Rogan great

2205
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:34,016
Great great great great first talk about that occurs

2206
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,088
Robert Malone

2207
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,416
Because of what's happening is on a plane right now to Austin

2208
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:49,376
Are not going to work so very very exciting

2209
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,216
Excited

2210
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:54,240
You know it's

2211
01:47:54,752 --> 01:48:00,128
Closes when he gets removed from Twitter another door opens which is

2212
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,432
He's going to be unbroken and

2213
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,480
And the people that I work with instrumental

2214
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,016
In making that

2215
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:11,648
On Ruby

2216
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,672
Extraordinary

2217
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
And

2218
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:15,488
If we can get Robert

2219
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,536
On on Rogan

2220
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,072
I think that'll bring the house down

2221
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:22,400
Who's the great incentive Rogan getting deeper and deeper

2222
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:28,544
When do the world of anti-vax propaganda ultimately lead to a ton of people in his audience being hurt and possibly dying

2223
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,360
To the tragedy to see how irresponsible he's being

2224
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,176
With his platform is going to be on

2225
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,456
Wichita's appear that he is

2226
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,528
Junior on

2227
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,552
Holyshit

2228
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:46,208
What's the thieves claimed that he was instrumental in getting ballon booked on Rogan show that's probably true

2229
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,048
Buckland Bret Weinstein was going really hard in the Ivermectin game

2230
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,584
In June of this year

2231
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,680
He didn't episode of his podcast Dark Horse titled how to save the world in

2232
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,960
Three easy steps

2233
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:01,056
The guest on that episode where Steve Kirsch and Robert Malone

2234
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:06,176
Just after they recorded that episode Brett was a guest on Rogan's podcast along with doctor

2235
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,200
A quarry

2236
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:12,064
The founder of the anti-vaccine pro Ivermectin group the Frontline covid-19 critical Caroline

2237
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:16,416
It's within the realm of believability that Brett set up that booking

2238
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:20,512
Ain't given that Malone and curse word Gaston on brat show

2239
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,816
Spreading vaccine misinformation I can believe

2240
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,376
EBay baby open to getting

2241
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,704
On the larger platform getting them up onto the big leagues if you're welcome

2242
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:34,336
There's a subtle network of s*** heads that are desperately trying to court Rogan to utilizes platforms

2243
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:38,432
Accordingly

2244
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,504
Zestful according really throw to go along with it

2245
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,320
Wow looking over the guest list

2246
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:47,392
Ava Rogan for the past couple months

2247
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,160
It heads

2248
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:53,024
Shapiro Alex Berenson

2249
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,304
Steven Pinker

2250
01:49:54,816 --> 01:50:00,192
I would think that Alex would be really concerned with his friend Joe buddying up with someone with such clear ties to Epstein

2251
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,240
But I guess that's only a problem when he wants it

2252
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:03,776
Anyway

2253
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,568
Yeah I

2254
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
Find this

2255
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,384
Awful I think it's

2256
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:10,176
Really really great

2257
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,200
That

2258
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,016
When you give somebody a hundred million dollars

2259
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:17,088
They almost invariably turn into a right-wing show

2260
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,368
Yeah

2261
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:22,208
I think that's great I do wonder if this is kind of like

2262
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,744
Performance art piece

2263
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,536
Where's Joey

2264
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,328
Trying to see what

2265
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:33,728
He can do without them cancelling the deal how can I burn

2266
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:35,776
A hundred million dollars like the fuc

2267
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,544
Joker

2268
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:40,384
I mean I think even without that hundred million dollars is perfectly set

2269
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,224
You know like for life

2270
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,784
Why not trying like see how far you

2271
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Can go before

2272
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,344
Demodex

2273
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:54,464
You got it we got to cancel it

2274
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,000
At the same time

2275
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,792
Heads on

2276
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,560
He's

2277
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,584
Clearly

2278
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
Dabbling

2279
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:03,424
Deeper and deeper into vaccine misinformation

2280
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:06,240
Robert Malone on

2281
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,032
I'm getting won't have our

2282
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:08,800
Likes back on

2283
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,592
You got to ask yourself

2284
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,872
Well little bit of a question

2285
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,408
If you're Alex

2286
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:17,504
Maybe it's time to Sneaky Snake if I want to go back

2287
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
2

2288
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,552
Twelve-year-old me

2289
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,880
Watching Newsradio on A&E

2290
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:25,696
At 4 in the afternoon

2291
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
Hey guess what

2292
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,488
See that dumb guy

2293
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:29,792
He's going to ruin the world

2294
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:36,448
The whole world not just newsradio's world yeah it's weird for me too because I think one of my first

2295
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
Interact

2296
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Actions with Rogan

2297
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Wasn't Newsradio cuz maybe

2298
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:45,664
Didn't realize that with school he was

2299
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,224
I wasn't aware of him as a comedian or anything

2300
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,064
I think the first time he came into my periphery was when he was a guest on Loveline

2301
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:56,672
Pretty Charming Gaston Loveline is pretty funny

2302
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:03,072
To look back on that it's like wow him and Adam Carolla both both really really fell off

2303
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,864
Dr. Drew

2304
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:11,008
Awful I am starting to think that you should not give white men a s*** ton of money

2305
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
Hey

2306
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,896
I don't want to think anymore about Loveline

2307
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,664
Don't do it

2308
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:23,296
The guestlist is going to start looking a lot like Road into the past few months

2309
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:28,672
I broke it

2310
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:32,000
It's true now if they're not all crazy it's no

2311
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:37,632
Sia anyway we come to the end of this and how is good as caught up

2312
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:41,216
I know I know people who've been on Rogan

2313
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,752
I mean it's just banana

2314
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:43,520
Laura B

2315
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:49,920
Anybody else that we might borrow

2316
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,944
Red was on was

2317
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Chris

2318
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,504
I don't know baby

2319
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,040
Impossible

2320
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:59,136
Realm of availability

2321
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:06,560
Elon Musk

2322
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:10,656
Otherwise we'll be back Jordan but until then we have

2323
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,704
We do it's knowledge right.com

2324
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:23,968
Next year

2325
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,736
Siam

2326
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,552
Let me down on team human baby

2327
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,832
And now here comes

2328
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,856
The sex robot

2329
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:32,160
