1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,624
Quite awhile

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
I just made what I gave you ever heard before.

5
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
Inspire people to listen I would say the people find a dynamic interesting between a person who spends all of their

6
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
Time studying Alex Jones

7
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,984
First person

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
Interesting

9
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,784
Plan for y'all's to enjoy tonight before we get into

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
To the show I need to make a public apology

11
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
Daniel wanted or please me

12
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,752
We believe it is it when we get something wrong

13
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:21,152
And we are aware of the public

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
I put out an article and I went and investigated the radio station

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,416
Come to the conclusion that I came to I found 32 stations

16
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
He was on the United States

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,328
However I accidentally stumbled onto another list of Alex Jones Affiliates last night

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
And I went through all of them

19
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
A bunch of them were not accurate they've dropped him

20
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,336
Great a couple and I found 10 additional stations that Alex is on

21
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
So I can read

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,016
I can reasonably say at this point that Alex Jones maybe on 42 stations in the United States

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
And I would like to I would like to apologize for the inaccuracy of the fur

24
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
First version of the article the article has been updated

25
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
But

26
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Again

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
It doesn't matter

28
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Pictures of Sean Hannity is on 500 something

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
Glenn Beck is on 500 something radio station

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Rush Limbaugh's on 590 radio station 1340 is a very

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,712
In those extra 10 radio station

32
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Is that you

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,088
You've discovered its 10% of government

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,208
The other 30 million were a we're hanging out on all makes

35
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
Yeah yeah

36
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Hard seltzer

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Which I discovered

38
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Hard Seltzer in the world which

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Do not understand.

40
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,712
I also don't think it's a worthy thing to hold up on a pedestal purity

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Of Seltzer is that

42
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
All of these have a promise ring around them so that it's better

43
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Good I'm not super hungover

44
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:18,912
Last time we tried to drink These Eyes they tasted like s***

45
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
Now I'd like to give a shout out

46
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
A couple of new donors what's going on out there Kevin

47
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,896
I'm a policy wonk

48
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
Thank you so much for joining up

49
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,696
Kevin Hart got defensive of Kevin

50
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,840
Yeah

51
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
I also would like to give a shout out to someone who did donate bumped it up

52
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
Very much this lady is a delight

53
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
You are now a technocrat

54
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,088
Someone sodomites

55
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
Set me a bucket of poop

56
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Thank you so much Sonia

57
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
If you

58
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Would like

59
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
Thank you so much

60
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
Sonia

61
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
You can't buy going through our website

62
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
We would appreciate it very much

63
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
Hey look Soros incoming

64
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,903
Public declaration

65
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Let me be honest with you if you just want to see if you just want to put a dollar bill

66
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
Inside of an envelope

67
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Don't

68
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Don't put any address on there

69
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Chances are it will show up at our

70
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
I want to make this public declaration because I think I've been wrestling with this

71
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Okay

72
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
With depression I have no great great show sad to see it end

73
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Is wrapping it up

74
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
But

75
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
I've come to realization that I would reject Soros money

76
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
If it was ever offer

77
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Let's be clear

78
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Nor will it

79
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,983
But I realized it just based on how easy it is to attack that I wouldn't want that to be

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Piece of

81
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Who We Are

82
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
And what the perception of what we do is

83
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,407
So I make this promise to the audience

84
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
We will reject Soros money if it's ever offered

85
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And it is not there

86
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,343
And it would need to be to be a lot

87
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Needville

88
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,207
Far out is getting really smart in the chat room suggesting that

89
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
We're just trying to beg

90
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
If we could offer us like 3 million

91
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
Dollars I would put that into a CD and let me tell you something

92
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
I would live off the in

93
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
Well that's a whole different issue

94
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,735
If I have enough money to create a good Financial strategy

95
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,367
I would do that and then I would get voting Republican operating like 60

96
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,255
Capital gains tax on 1.5

97
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
Have to get but I would say to point

98
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Anyway

99
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Got it

100
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
At $3000000 would put us up for life

101
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
True I like it.

102
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,951
You couldn't afford a guy got a yacht on Lake Michigan timing

103
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
We will be

104
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
Going over the April 4th

105
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
2018 episode

106
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
From Wednesday

107
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,615
And the boy family known as April Fool's Day

108
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
404

109
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Yeah

110
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Are you doing

111
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
Has not found

112
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,343
No

113
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
This show is

114
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
It is super messed up

115
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Really stupid stuff happened the day right after the shooting at YouTube headquarters

116
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Okay and weirdly Alex

117
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,055
Does not talk about that very much

118
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
He would make hay out of it but he doesn't

119
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Except to sort of say like

120
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
Hey it's interesting that no one's talking about

121
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
Petered out a little bit

122
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
But I think that's because no one died

123
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Except for the shooter herself

124
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
That makes it a little bit less severe we have more pressing issues

125
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Articles

126
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
To think about how

127
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
California's gun laws

128
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
Actually probably prevented this from being

129
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
She didn't have an AR

130
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
Statistics of shown that it doesn't

131
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
You can't really stop someone

132
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
I'm from doing something like this

133
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
But you can

134
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Limit

135
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
The number of people who

136
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
Get killed

137
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
Consistently

138
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,423
Is counter to his narrative about the shooting

139
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,007
I think it's going to infuriate you

140
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
How we start

141
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Our investigation

142
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,871
Great-aunt

143
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
But this is

144
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,855
What happens as

145
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Impossible

146
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,839
Revolution info

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
What do you think about that how's that grab you

148
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Even say that

149
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
I don't I don't think that's I think he's misinterpreting and missing the club

150
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
And the f****** quotes

151
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
No

152
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
No not at all

153
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
Dubstep

154
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
He's pitching this

155
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Is that like

156
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,863
YouTube's the f******

157
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
She's got

158
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
She had her videos demonetized when YouTube

159
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Structure

160
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,407
I met something that's what they're well within their rights to do they didn't Banner they didn't sense her they just changed their business

161
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
This model in such a way that smaller channels

162
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
The revenue when they

163
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Don't have ads

164
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Videos anymore

165
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
So that

166
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
I mean it sucks for

167
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
For people I get that I have the size with that

168
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
And I think it's probably

169
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Of YouTube in some ways but it's not

170
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
Ethically wrong it's not

171
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,655
Home Depot

172
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Something that we've just accepted is corporations to do

173
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
Not necessarily exploited

174
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
Small channels that don't have ads on their videos

175
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
That you were just giving a place where they can put them up

176
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
Sure your overall traffic Rises

177
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
What is infant asthma

178
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Compared to the big

179
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Channels that have

180
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Millions of subscribers and

181
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Hundreds of Millions

182
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
The views on their videos

183
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Exploitative in terms of expectation

184
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Because there

185
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,799
Pitching this idea of a world

186
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Where you put videos up on YouTube

187
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
If you play your cards right and your interesting

188
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
You'll make money off at a small minority

189
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Posting videos to YouTube that make

190
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,207
Any reasonable amount of money of course they pitched this idea of like

191
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,791
This is a way that you can build an audience and build an income stream

192
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Awesome babe

193
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
Did a lot of people are disenchanted by the idea of

194
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Even that fantasy

195
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Taken away from them

196
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Yeah

197
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:29,151
It's like being in the Alex Jones sales paper mitski member

198
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
Sell it hard and then

199
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
It doesn't work out

200
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,551
Admittedly

201
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
Don't understand everything about this shooter or their motivation

202
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
But I will say that I was saying

203
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Alex's pitching a stupid narrative

204
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
And she used it to shoot

205
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah there's that

206
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
That's probably a foundational problem

207
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
And the other

208
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
I'm really I'm just uncomfortable with Alex's like

209
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
This is what happens

210
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Like

211
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,295
I mean it's not okay

212
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Frankly at this point

213
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Alright I do I understand that

214
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Like I understand that reaction

215
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,399
Not given his prior comment f****** anesthetized

216
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
Constant

217
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,775
Unending stream of gun violence Earth at 4

218
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Bring going on for

219
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
What

220
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
All of America

221
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Play it's it's something that

222
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
Will not be addressed and the craziest thing is I think

223
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
There's a

224
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
There's a serious chance

225
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
If we were to

226
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,415
F****** do it

227
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
That we could repeal the 2nd Amendment

228
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
I bet we have more than two-thirds of states that would be willing to look at the f****** governors

229
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
I don't believe that

230
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,359
The legislators that have

231
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
To vote on

232
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,455
The governor is it today

233
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,343
No the governor's whenever it's like

234
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
Did in the chat room almost

235
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Immediately

236
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Amendment

237
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
There's no other way to repeal them

238
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
But you can't get that one off there

239
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,239
You have to now come up with another amendment does what that Amendment

240
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Witch hazel

241
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
I believe it's been done

242
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
Before I has

243
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
I'm literally or literally repealed an amendment

244
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Yeah

245
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
Sure I die just groovy I don't think

246
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
If possible

247
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
Necessary

248
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Maybe the Supreme Court RI

249
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Looking at

250
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Where We Are

251
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,895
Which is of course and of course that's what you get

252
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,479
There's no real Avenue to correct it

253
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
I agree

254
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
It's mess

255
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
Always talks about the victim

256
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Disarmament Zone

257
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Beware shooting

258
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Things happen

259
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
You're like school

260
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
There's no guns

261
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
School

262
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
So that's weird Shooters go

263
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
This is work

264
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
This is your work play

265
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,447
Yeah is are fairly common

266
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
But also

267
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
It's just a matter of people are disarmed

268
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
This Google headquarters

269
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Security

270
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
That's why she shot through the back door to get in

271
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,575
Funeral

272
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
Because there's heavy security

273
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Yeah

274
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
And so I mean it's not a disarm

275
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
RedZone it's not like a

276
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
A situation where

277
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Hey

278
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
This suggests

279
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Let's armed teachers

280
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Stupid into

281
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Disastrous world where

282
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
You're teaching people with

283
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Thread of a gun

284
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Go to work without

285
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Maybe people

286
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Your boss having a gun

287
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,295
Yeah it sounds like the solutions that are

288
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
Realistically proposed by either side are

289
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Hey let's

290
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Limit guns

291
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Because

292
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Where the other side is

293
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
What if everybody had a gun nobody be shooting anybody

294
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,519
We're legitimately pushing ever closer to the day

295
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Deep Space 9 m m

296
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Video becoming real

297
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
Everyone

298
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
In society in a Mexican standoff with each other

299
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,807
Alex talks about a new initiative

300
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
It's probably

301
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Maybe thinking about my

302
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
I have no idea

303
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
I think this is bad and anybody else

304
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
How to be super again

305
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815

Resources at my other sources in the house

00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Uncle months ago that he's been talking to Peter

He does say oh

312
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
All these channels amplify ham

313
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
He's been briefed

314
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,039
Face-to-face by three people I know in the last month

315
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Doubt this is

316
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Volume from 11

317
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,791
Ouch

318
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
I have the midterms are dialing everybody

319
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,191
Congresswoman running for congress

00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,311
And Facebook

321
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
There their they're

322
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
Yeah those milquetoast poor shooting their false flag video

323
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
And so that is the big enchilada

324
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
So it's fine cuz I look says everything's a big enchilada but also right there at the end

325
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
Trump is pushing for regulation

326
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,375
Big companies great idea as long as it supports

327
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,495
Or benefits conservatives regulation is great wonderful

328
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
Whenever it helps you

329
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
It's odd that you're not for regulation

330
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
Whatever regulation is good for you

331
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
It almost seems hypocritical Dan it look frankly

332
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Doesn't want to put up with my b*******

333
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,791
The government wants to save a emission standards

334
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Because

335
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
You know some cities are

336
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
Exactly

337
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Some cities have unbreathable are really bad at Monopoly

338
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Is an oxymoron

339
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
Red is not a possible thing

340
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Well if you are a leftist

341
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,295
You are aware that monopolies are in

342
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Apparently

343
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Damaging

344
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623

Economic

349
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
But that's as baby came

350
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Authoritarian

It might be fun it's fun to me

Trump

359
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Because you love torture

360
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
I like reading things

361
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,231

Text to read to you

363
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
And it comes to a head on this episode

364
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
I want to clear the air about some

365
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,103
Right before that episode

366
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,919
It's not I don't really care about that

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759

But also I want to be

384
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Be clear about this

385
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Cuz this is something that I had to look into because of the Larry's

386
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,991

That's why heat press conference

390
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,511
The Press Club to rent out a room at the Press Club

391
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,839

392
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Press conference

393
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,679
They just allow people to do it so

394
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
Congratulations

395
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,263

396
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
It's not it's really not cheap

397
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Yeah that's a good point

398
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
Think we should

399
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943

I never learned how to read

422
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
MEP what the end result of this is going to be is like

423
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
I hope someone slips through the cracks

424
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Lincoln asking real question

425
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
But it's going to be like Jerome course he's going to be there at the question

426
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Yeah it'll just be a Roundtable a dick

427
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
It's going to lose weight

428
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Alex

429
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
I've heard

430
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Your dick is huge

431
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Can you,

432
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
No,

433
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
But yes

434
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,200
I have sources that excuse me

435
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
It will be understand you're the smartest child

436
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,928
We might have to do an emergency episode next week because this is on a Tuesday

437
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Like we might have to

438
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
Cuz this is going to be a zoo

439
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
It's going to be the most ridiculous

440
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:36,704
I know she's trying to make it as hard as possible for the media to RSVP apparently

441
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:43,616
It we can watch it for the Press spoiler on Thursday

442
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Thursday's show this

443
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,944
Cute outfit is that at that press conference

444
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
He's going to name the first

445
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
Two people he's suing

446
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Quote on quote

447
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
Enemies of the Republic all right

448
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,656
Hey Tammy the enemies of the Republic I also hope we're one of them I hope

449
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
All that was a letter by now right

450
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
I'd love it

451
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
They're going to because I think it's probably the

452
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Justin Bieber suing

453
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
I assume

454
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Just all countersuit

455
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,112
The pope is going to be named in there

456
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,696
Because he thinks the pope is suing him

457
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Depends on what you think of republic

458
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
It's a great restaurant

459
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,400
From it is a book

460
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Anyway

461
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
In his next clip

462
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
Alex is talking about

463
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Damn life.

464
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,104
The leftist

465
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
Their scourge of the world

466
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
They are

467
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
With their monopolies

468
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,856
And they're very repealing the First Amendment

469
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Which you know

470
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Peter teal

471
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
Love the First Amendment

472
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
Absolutely is never tried to infringe upon first amendment that demonstrated his commitment to

473
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
Yeah it is next clip though Alex's

474
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Probably I guess he's

475
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Fluent

476
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
And often

477
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
And I believe

478
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
Nope not little girl

479
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,528
And then I just walked all over Austin and cut stone

480
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Knossos CCP or whatever

481
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
Shut up Grandpa

482
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:51,616
I want our bodies kill the Midwest

483
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,064
Reorganizing a giant bloodline

484
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,680
You are self-sufficient

485
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
They want to rape your wife

486
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,928
Whoever they want they want authoritarianism

487
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,768
And your children

488
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,608
Their religion is pedophilia

489
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,424
And starving you to death and murdering you

490
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
You talk about George Soros

491
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,944
This is troubling

492
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
If true hold on hold on

493
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,808
You talk about George Soros and he's like that's why they're God is

494
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
This guy but list

495
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
Is this really quick

496
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,024
Nazis when he was 14

497
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,168
60 minutes

498
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,984
And you would do it over again and he's not ashamed

499
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Alex Amin

500
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
Accidentally just said thesaurus help around up Nazi

501
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Because

502
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
He's he's just written

503
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
He's just doing his his thing

504
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Boy that's intense

505
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,832
Can you imagine living in a headspace where you believed I was

506
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,904
True like how how much that would make an impression on

507
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,976
Like if you lived in a world where you thought Alex

508
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
The credible source

509
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
You thought he knew any

510
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,376
Hey do you think he's up there screaming about like our enemies want to watch

511
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
She would starve

512
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
And rape your wife and

513
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Children

514
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
And create an authoritarian state

515
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Like

516
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
That's if if that's if you believe that

517
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
Existential threat on a level of

518
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,552
Yes of course you would grab a gun and go to a f****** Pizza Joint

519
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
Politically

520
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,744
No I didn't have any choice

521
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,864
Like if I believe that somebody was actually trying to do that

522
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
Then the only rational

523
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
With

524
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Guns

525
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,616
Whatever

526
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
No.

527
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
What do you think

528
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,016
It's a mess

529
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
That's not good no I think this rhetoric is incredibly dangerous

530
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,768
Rape your wife is incredibly dangerous

531
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,888
Evans next Calypso Alex Jones gets in

532
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
2

533
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,704
He gets into thesaurus

534
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,776
And he gets into

535
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,800
God stuff

536
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,336
They're wild Electric

537
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,176
He has a little bit of a breakdown on air and I think

538
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
It's really funny

539
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,272
Buy in some ways but it's also super not funny

540
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Another way

541
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
So this is Mike down clip cuz you got to enjoy the

542
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
The nuances of Alex freaking out

543
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
For his stepfather and help round up

544
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,800
He would do it over again and he's not ashamed

545
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
If somebody else didn't do it he would have done

546
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,912
Another version

547
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
.

548
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
Killer

549
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,920
Worship

550
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
And I just think

551
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,448
Dark that's fun

552
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
It's enjoyed it's fun cuz of the growling and how stupid is a big fan of

553
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
Sinners in the hands of an Angry God

554
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,504
I mean business

555
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
This is neck

556
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Next Level just a crock

557
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,344
Gosha

558
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
We've talked about Soros a bit

559
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
In the past

560
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
About how Alex is wrong about him

561
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:31,584
The collaborator

562
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,632
We have but we haven't talked about him

563
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Enough

564
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Quite frankly

565
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Because

566
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,264
I just think

567
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Look

568
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
I think that anytime you're a billionaire

569
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
You're probably a dick

570
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
There's no way around

571
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,552
I just think I definitely don't worship any billionaires

572
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,904
No as you know I'm very strong actually anti billionaire

573
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:01,024
Violently so I think it's worthwhile to always have

574
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
A default position

575
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Skepticism

576
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
And suspicion

577
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,680
Of people who are tremendously well

578
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
Netflix

579
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Sad

580
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
I think that there's more we need to talk about

581
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
As it relates to

582
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
Soros because it's not enough

583
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
That we you got you got your

584
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Paragraphs

585
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,736
Right ready now don't you

586
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Memoirs

587
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,624
I knew it I read some interviews with him and I have

588
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Really important things that I think people need to know

589
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
You know people digest things better in a

590
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
That's true to make memes

591
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Adam DeVine

592
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,752
The issues that I come down to is that literally everything that Alex Jones says about

593
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
George Soros

594
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
The only thing that I guess

595
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Could be said is true

596
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
Is that he has worked

597
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
To overthrow

598
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
That's true but they were

599
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Soviet

600
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Revenant government

601
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Free

602
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,952
Society they were oppressive regime

603
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,024
That existed in the crumbling of the

604
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
The Soviet Union

605
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
Do you have people like Slobodan milosevic

606
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
In Yugoslavia

607
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
That he funded

608
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,776
Bunch of youth group you don't want to try and take him down that's

609
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
That's bad student groups

610
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
And like

611
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
Pro freedom of speech

612
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Which groups and pro-democracy

613
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,456
In Yugoslavia

614
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
He would give

615
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
He sent

616
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,576
Billions of dollars worth of Aid and photocopier

617
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,344
So they could

618
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Create publication

619
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Could put out

620
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,184
In order to

621
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Elevate

622
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
You thought

623
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
Hey hey

624
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
Genocide Allstate

625
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
But Slobodan milosevic

626
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
Was Russia

627
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
And Alex is

628
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,984
Speaking the truth in some ways

629
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
That he has worked against

630
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Government

631
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Right but they are consist

632
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
Across-the-board

633
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Not democracy

634
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:59,040
Now in places where are old Pals Kissinger in

635
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
The entire United States

636
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,928
Worked tirelessly to overthrow democratic government

637
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
If you want to go into f****** Iran

638
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
We are the ones

639
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
Who made that dictatorship

640
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
That is all

641
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,288
Democratic Republic

642
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Think that

643
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,920
It's telling us all of their oil with such a great idea

644
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Trust the United States

645
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
What hundred percent right

646
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
Right there

647
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Because I thought

648
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,672
There is that

649
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,720
But if you look at cirrhosis history

650
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
That's not the

651
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Necessarily that he's been involved

652
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Have you opened

653
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah

654
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,144
I'm not saying all of their history is perfect

655
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Rebels against a

656
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
Evil dictatorship

657
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm kind of Envoy

658
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,896
The reason of my chair looks the way it does is because

659
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:59,968
Celine climbs on the top of it and tears it all apart

660
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
So if it bothers you I'm sorry

661
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,832
I'm having a very aggressive cat

662
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Hey happen

663
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
Back sore throat

664
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,488
When Alex is talking about in that clip

665
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
He enjoyed that

666
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,864
He was under Nazi occupation

667
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Yeah when he was

668
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
Perhaps 13 years old

669
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
It's really important

670
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Contacts

671
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Now it's never does

672
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,080
And when he's in that clip threatening to

673
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
Play the entire sea

674
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
60 Minutes interview

675
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
You know God damn well he's not going

676
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,224
Because it would reveal the contents

677
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,296
I know I want to further elucidate that context

678
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,832
Because I

679
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:37,856
The really important

680
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
To speak about

681
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
In the face

682
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Of this

683
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Aggressive

684
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Buganda

685
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
Also really quick one other really important

686
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,304
To consider is

687
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
You were talking about the

688
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:51,424
The crumbling of the Soviet Union

689
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
Funding initiatives

690
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,496
For democracy and free

691
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Free speech

692
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Freedom in Ozark

693
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Doing a lot of that stuff

694
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
About Russia

695
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
I am.

696
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,224
There might be a correlation

697
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:09,088
Back back to this other issue

698
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,648
Soros is talking about the best year of his

699
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
His life

700
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
It relates back to how much

701
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
He loves his daddy

702
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,328
And I want to talk to you a little bit about some comments that he made about

703
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,608
What is that in an interview

704
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,144
That I think are elucidating

705
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
I am very

706
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,776
He volunteered in the first World War

707
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
He was promoted to Lieutenant

708
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
He was then taken prisoner of war

709
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
On the Russian front

710
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Concentra Siberia

711
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
You still very ambitious

712
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
The editor of the newspaper called the

713
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
It was written by hand and nail to apply

714
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
The Authors Hit behind the plank

715
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
Listen to the comments of the reader

716
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
I remember seeing the collective copies of the

717
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
The blank is a child he brought them home from

718
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,720
From Siberia

719
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Then

720
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,536
He was elected prisoner's representative

721
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Some prisoners escaped in the neighboring

722
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,144
Camp in the prisoners representative was shot

723
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Retaliation

724
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
He decided to be better to escape than

725
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
To be shot for other people

726
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
He selected 30 people for their skills

727
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,360
Carpenter cook doctor and so on

728
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Because he had no practice

729
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Call skills

730
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
And they broke out of

731
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
He had a plan to build a raft

732
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,832
The drift down to the ocean mistake because his geography was somewhat deficient

733
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
He didn't realize that all the rivers

734
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,416
Siberia emptied into the ark

735
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,184
Ocean

736
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
They built this wrapped

737
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
They floated down the river

738
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
And it took them quite a few weeks

739
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
Who discovered they were heading for the Arctic Ocean

740
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
Finally they realize that they would have to make their way through the wilderness

741
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
Civilization

742
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
That took them several months

743
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,032
And because the revolution they were caught up in the turmoil of the region

744
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
At that time

745
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
A check officer ruled Siberia from

746
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Armored railroad car

747
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
There were Reds and white

748
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:40,480
And they kept on killing each other and killing the population

749
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
He went through some horrendous experience

750
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
The talking the value of

751
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Being alive

752
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
So now

753
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
To the point of this specific

754
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Piece of

755
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm talking about the best year of his life

756
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Being that gear

757
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Is that

758
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
And forged papers.

759
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
To live with this guy

760
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Who went around and catalogued

761
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Possessions of

762
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
Not rounding up

763
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
Is that party completely

764
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
This quote is

765
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
Is relevant

766
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,664
The German occupation came in March 19th

767
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
1044

768
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,712
I was not yet fourteen

769
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
That was my father's finest hour

770
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
Because he knew how to act

771
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
He understood this

772
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,136
Situation he realized that the normal rules did not apply

773
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
Obeying the law became a dangerous at

774
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Flaunting it was the way to survive

775
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
Having experienced the Russian Revolution

776
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
He knew what to do

777
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
He made arrangements

778
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,632
For the family to get false identity papers

779
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,168
Found places for us to live or

780
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
Where to hide

781
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,776
He helped not only his immediate family but a fairly large number of other people around

782
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
I can truthfully say that he saved us

783
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Signs of live

784
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
This is a. Of exciting Adventure

785
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
I could go on and on about it because it's

786
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Etched into my memory

787
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Although I rarely talk about it

788
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
The importance of paradoxical point

789
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
The 1944 with

790
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
The happiest year of my life

791
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,672
It's a strange and almost defensive things

792
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
To say because 1944's

793
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
The year of the Holocaust

794
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
But it's true

795
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
I was 14 years old

796
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
I had a father whom I adored

797
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,120
It wasn't Commando

798
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Do the situation

799
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
Who knew what the

800
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,192
To do and who helped others

801
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,008
I was aware of the danger but I felt vulnerable

802
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
I was aware of the stuff around us

803
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,848
But we did everything we could to help others

804
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,896
Just to give you a small example used

805
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Stand in line

806
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
A cigarettes

807
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,224
They were Distributing five cigarettes

808
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
Per person and then give them to Jews who were

809
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
Restricted from Jewish houses

810
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Current lineup

811
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
Perhaps the only time I was physically affected

812
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
It was immediately after the siege of Budapest

813
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
When they were lots of corpse

814
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
Just lying about

815
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
There was one

816
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
It's call Bash.

817
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
I felt sick for days after

818
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Phuc yea

819
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
This is

820
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
Absolutely

821
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
And part of it was

822
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Because of his

823
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,056
Experience

824
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Do you suffer.

825
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Repressive

826
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Russian regime

827
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
Goddamn so that informed

828
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
His father's life

829
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
An intern

830
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
The entirety of Soros

831
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
George Soros

832
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
And

833
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
It's really really bulshit

834
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
To try and claim this

835
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Soros is trying

836
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Create some sort of

837
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,864
Authoritarian state or is it

838
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Communism

839
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
Or anything like that

840
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
I have pulled up some quotes of his

841
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,032
Cuz now not only is

842
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,616
Like prior to this I just assumed that

843
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
I saw roses.

844
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,968
Yeah I was just trying to go along to get along

845
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
And

846
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,576
Alex's of course as is exploiting the fact

847
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,368
That his dad was just trying to

848
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
To survive

849
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
And keep the sun alive

850
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
To learn that

851
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,304
Alex Jones is

852
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Literally

853
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,960
F****** destroying the accomplishments of a genuine hero

854
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,288
Anderson

855
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,312
To any of this

856
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
He knows it

857
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
And he's willfully misrepresenting

858
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
The alternative

859
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
Which is more like

860
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,368
To the point of Soros being in favor of communism

861
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
I will redo some quote

862
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,024
I'd live through Nazi persecution and Soviet occupation

863
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Poppers book Karl Popper

864
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Surah study

865
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Philosophy

866
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
When he was in high school at

867
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
He considers himself

868
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Philosophy

869
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,312
Kind of quiet

870
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:21,408
Alright a book open Society

871
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
The force of a revelation

872
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
It showed that fascism

873
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
Communism have a lot in common

874
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
And they both stand in opposition to

875
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,856
The different principle of social organization

876
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
The principle of an open

877
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Society

878
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Hey my philosophy

879
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,536
Open Society is based on the recognition that we all act on the basis

880
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Perfect understand

881
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Nobody is in possession

882
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
End of the ultimate

883
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,424
Therefore we need a critical mode

884
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,704
We need

885
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,776
Tuitions and rulers that allow people with different opinions and interests

886
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
To live together in peace

887
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,360
We need a democratic form of government that is

888
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
Pictures that the orderly trance

889
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
Power we need a market economy

890
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
That provides feedback

891
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,759
It allows mistakes

892
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
To be corrected

893
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
We need to protect minority

894
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Respect minority opinion

895
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
Above all we need the rule of law

896
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,439
Ideologies like fascism

897
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,719
Communism

898
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Close Society

899
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
In which the individual is subjugated

900
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
Society is dominated by the state

901
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,911
Anastasia's and service of a dog mother claims

902
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Anybody else

903
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
In such a society

904
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
There is no freedom

905
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
I knew the Communist Dogma was false

906
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,847
Because it was a Dogma

907
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,199
If Noah if one could Foster Alternatives open the door for other ideas

908
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
The falsehood of that Dogma will become obvious

909
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,807
By undermining the Dogma one would

910
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
Inspect weaken the regime

911
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,647
I did not expect its communist system

912
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Collapse

913
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
But I did want a week

914
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
From within by making Alternatives available

915
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
And supporting critical

916
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Right

917
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
So that's kind of couch

918
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
To the way that Alex

919
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Resent

920
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
His philosophy

921
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Pretty much

922
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,823
And the same time Alex

923
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,103
Will suck Putin

924
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,783
For sure because he's a male

925
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,183
Strange how that works out

926
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
Yeah

927
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
So I read an article from the early to

928
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
2000

929
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
About Georgia

930
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,351
From La time

931
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:22,239
Sources efforts in Yugoslavia that's talking about

932
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Student groups fighting against

933
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Slobodan milosevic

934
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Football off of it

935
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,895
Just a small part of its enormous Financial

936
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Support over the past decade

937
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
The first time zone

938
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
The first

939
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
First

940
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,647
At first tens of millions and hundreds of millions of year for democratically Mighty groups throughout the former communist world

941
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,975
This work which got its branch in Belarus expelled from that country tonight

942
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
97

943
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
Has helped strengthen the thousands of nonprofit organizations

944
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,887
In countries where 1989 communist parties ran almost

945
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,423
Soros help

946
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
Find Independent Media in Serbia

947
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
The dominant Republic of Yugoslavia 2

948
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Powerful State television

949
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Which function

950
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
As a mouthpiece

951
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
For milosevic

952
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,199
As communist country is communist control disappeared

953
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Resurgent nationalism ethnic

954
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Intolerance pressure

955
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
On free speech and authoritarian rulers

956
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
I threatened hopes for democracy

957
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Soros.

958
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
The antidote

959
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
Strong citizen organization

960
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Respect for civil liberties in minority groups

961
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
The rule of law and the growth of Market

962
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,447
So the little bit frustrating not

963
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Doing it

964
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
To the same extent

965
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
It's in our

966
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Essential

967
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Fascist

968
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Capitalism

969
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,967
I think it's trying

970
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
In some ways

971
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
This is not a Soros sucks

972
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,903
It's not it's just to say that

973
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
This perception that Alex is

974
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
Creating of him

975
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Wheatley wrong

976
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,559
On so many very intrinsic

977
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,607
Level

978
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Enjoying

979
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Will being a Nazi

980
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Collaborator isn't true cuz he wasn't a Nazi collaborator

981
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
And the parties talking about enjoying

982
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
Is

983
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Getting to

984
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Experience

985
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,383
How capable and heroic

986
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
His father was

987
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,711
And how much he loved his father's heroism

988
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
In the face

989
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
All the totalitarian system

990
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
To murder them

991
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,367
And how his father went out of his

992
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,415
His way in order to help

993
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Strangers

994
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Help other people

995
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Will Survive

996
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,023
Now to tid of it

997
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:21,791
Like

998
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,815
I mean Alex

999
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,143
Also talked about that he wants to overthrow Israel

1000
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,983
And you talk about habits in the Wikileaks considering Israel is a

1001
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
What

1002
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,615
Tomorrow or Friday going to wind up killing hundreds of Palestinian

1003
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:41,247
I'm kind of overthrowing Israel at this point is real is real government

1004
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,039
Fascist

1005
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,647
Can government wants to overthrow Israel and it's very important

1006
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Come to point out that

1007
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,951
Misrepresenting

1008
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
What'd you find

1009
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
If you read the actual

1010
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Text

1011
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,583
That got leaked emails

1012
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
That were hacked

1013
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
Everybody knows that

1014
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,079
Recent years the radicalization of public opinion

1015
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
Attractive Israeli right-wing government

1016
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
Has resulted in more restrictive measures

1017
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Palestinians

1018
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
There have been numbers

1019
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Successes in challenging Israel's racist

1020
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
Anti-democratic

1021
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367
National Arena

1022
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Influencing

1023
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
EU

1024
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
Is real bilateral negotiations

1025
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
He's talking about is

1026
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
If you want to

1027
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
You push for

1028
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
A knot

1029
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
Racist state

1030
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
I am

1031
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,679
The issue is that people believe

1032
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
I think

1033
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Vet

1034
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Respecting Palestine

1035
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
Would get rid of these

1036
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,639
The Jewish character of the Israel

1037
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Israel as a state

1038
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
I don't know what to say to that

1039
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
I would say

1040
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Stop

1041
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:51,391
Stop killing people for the longest time it was always a

1042
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
Loaded

1043
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,719
Kind of conversation to

1044
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
To be like

1045
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:01,375
Israel but I don't like what they're doing and at this point is real

1046
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Government

1047
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,447
Not these really people although

1048
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,799
V Israel Israel's government is very popular with you Israeli

1049
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,615
Three people but they are now a genocide.

1050
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
More

1051
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
So

1052
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,759
F*** anybody who considers it a complicated question

1053
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,599
Write that but they don't consider Palestinians

1054
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,671
Within is real they consider Palestinian

1055
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
Every single Palestinian

1056
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
To be a rogue sticks

1057
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,071
And they are treating them as though they are at War

1058
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,935
It's like I said Friday there's going to be a demonstration

1059
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,263
50000 + Palestinian

1060
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,335
And the Israeli Army is going

1061
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
2 kill

1062
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127
Hundred.

1063
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
I would that is a guarantee

1064
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,223
We can't predict that but it does seem

1065
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,063
Like it's the most likely out to the high probability

1066
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903
Whatever whatever the case is there I want to

1067
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Focus more in on

1068
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Thesaurus claim

1069
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,767
Because all of them are

1070
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,071
The crashing economy stuff isn't

1071
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
If you look into it one of the big things is

1072
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
Is nickname is the man

1073
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Who broke

1074
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,239
Do the bank of Europe England

1075
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
Yeah and that's because

1076
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
He recognized the situation where

1077
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
Sitting made a billion dollars

1078
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
Everybody's like

1079
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
Aldi's market

1080
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Trend ahead of

1081
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:29,695
I would bet against whatever it is America

1082
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Economy is doing right now

1083
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
Going to collapse

1084
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Let's go hard

1085
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
So hard

1086
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
I have a lot of

1087
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
Weird protect

1088
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,751
Seems like sort of thing or you'll have like a really bad fight

1089
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Little

1090
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,103
Who knows we're not economic experts.

1091
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
Be over

1092
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
We're throwing government

1093
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,503
If you want to take that very Loosely UK

1094
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Conseil

1095
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
That

1096
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Yes you did work

1097
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,367
To try and help democratic

1098
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,135
Organization

1099
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Within

1100
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,439
Former Communist States

1101
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
So that's not really

1102
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
The crew said about it being a Nazi collaborator isn't

1103
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
It was the best time of my life that's not true

1104
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,655
And I want to read this last quote because

1105
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
I think it really is important

1106
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
And that is

1107
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Quote

1108
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,031
You may consider it weird

1109
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,383
But in my view it is an essential feature of an open society that not everything

1110
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
We should be to my like

1111
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
If I tried

1112
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,223
Control the content of every program

1113
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,855
He's talking about things that I would not be creating an open Society

1114
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,647
So right

1115
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,511
There's a well in our

1116
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
Is as

1117
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Something that is

1118
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
The seemingly impossible

1119
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
For people that

1120
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
To understand

1121
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
It is not

1122
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
Conservative

1123
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,335
Or anything along those lines

1124
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,711
The point is that there is no conversation

1125
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,783
Whenever you're not admitting that there's a problem

1126
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
Like

1127
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,111
If a conservative voice wants to come in

1128
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
And argue what the best

1129
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,695
Way to deal with climate

1130
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
Changes

1131
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,279
That is a conversation that an open Society can have

1132
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,887
Sure about the best way to deal with this problem

1133
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
But when you deny it's a problem

1134
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
You are killing me

1135
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,335
Add when you deny it's a problem in mysteriously

1136
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
You work for an organization

1137
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
As $500,000 of funding

1138
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,247
ExxonMobil Koch Foundation

1139
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271
The jet like that

1140
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,159
When you deliberately mislead people in order to make money

1141
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,487
You are a bad person on a

1142
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
Genuine love

1143
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
Mary goes back to the

1144
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
Impossibility of argue

1145
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
Man who is coming from a place of

1146
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,263
That's some of the stuff I wanted to talk about about George Soros

1147
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,639
I'm not saying you're defending him but like everything he's done is been ethical and perfect

1148
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:02,015
Jimin FF

1149
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
She has a

1150
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,111
You know I lived

1151
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
The very difficult life

1152
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Beginnings and

1153
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
I was able to become

1154
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,023
Really good at predicting

1155
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
Financial Trends in Mayfield

1156
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
And have given

1157
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
A lot of it back to

1158
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Two causes that

1159
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Most right

1160
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
Yeah but be that as it may Alex Jones

1161
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103
That he wants to jack off to help or you are in

1162
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
And that's what our next Play Store

1163
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
On purpose this is what they do

1164
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:44,255
Because they just want to murder people

1165
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
Good people

1166
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
And I get to have their way

1167
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,263
Once you understand that then you understand

1168
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
Pharaoh's wants to do one thing

1169
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,687
Overthrow countries destroyed economy

1170
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,551
Sandstone

1171
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
Skid Row

1172
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
I don't know how that relates anything

1173
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,647
I don't know it doesn't

1174
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
I don't know

1175
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,191
Trying to create Elementals in the lake

1176
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,007
The pretty f***** up stuff but like if you

1177
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,567
But yeah yeah

1178
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,919

Boils down to do what thou Wilt that is

1180
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,039
The whole of the law right but it also

1181
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,063
Good provision

1182
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
About like

1183
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
You can't just do thing

1184
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Thanks people

1185
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,391
That that

1186
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
Violate variability

1187
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Duet

1188
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
They will

1189
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,327
Well currently the Satanist churches the best Christian organization out there

1190
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Yeah

1191
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
They're the only ones

1192
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,895
Skip this next court because it's just Alex pretending

1193
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
He's going to play the entire sea

1194
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
60 Minutes interview

1195
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
I'm a dozen

1196
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
Because of course he can kind of experience

1197
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
Interrupt

1198
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,719
It doesn't go cuz he's not playing at all

1199
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,791
No he plays a cut that they made

1200
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,399
Between different interviews

1201
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Referring to

1202
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
Something that you

1203
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:05,567
That the endgame territory

1204
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,359
2007 S10 dimensions

1205
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,175
George Soros

1206
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
Terms of

1207
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
Politics in America since

1208
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:20,159
At least the 90s

1209
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
Joe Alex says that when he was a kid

1210
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
His mom

1211
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
I would be watching TV

1212
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
Sing about George Soros being evil and s*** like that

1213
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
So according to when Alex was a kid

1214
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
According to Alex

1215
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,079
His own version

1216
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
His own life

1217
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
You should have been aware of Soros

1218
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
He was a child

1219
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
But mysteriously you not in his

1220
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,319
Documentary that he made about the globalists and the game for society

1221
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
Weird

1222
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Maybe it was because it wasn't

1223
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
2007

1224
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,999
More on that in the future

1225
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Teaser

1226
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,327
Looking into that a little bit

1227
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
I can't

1228
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,519
How many times have we talked about the pointlessness

1229
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
Appointing out the Hip Hop

1230
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,591
Of these f***

1231
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,127
Being assholes not about hypocrisy

1232
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,431
About like

1233
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
To destroy infrastructure

1234
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:22,111
He wants to keep you high and and pouring all of those things

1235
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,135
And you look

1236
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Literally

1237
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,559
Policy decision that the current Trump f****** Government is made

1238
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,607
Bears out

1239
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
Line by line

1240
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:38,239
Lego

1241
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:44,895
Infrastructure issues riding like a works progress administration

1242
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
How many of these f******

1243
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
Thinks he's going to describe

1244
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,319
Globalists are doing that you can draw

1245
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,415
Parallel to what Trump is doing

1246
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
The best globalist

1247
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:07,167
See what you what you don't understand

1248
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,983
You stupid

1249
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
You sir are a fool

1250
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:17,407
That's a good pointers why I didn't consider that you do not understand

1251
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,479
The infrastructure sure we've got Bridges collapsing

1252
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:27,135
We got a lot of problems roads if on the road

1253
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,951
We got a lot of those problems

1254
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,559
Exist some people are Christian

1255
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,863
Weird

1256
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
Conservative Christian ideals

1257
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:45,567
And that is a f****** problem as that's what the globalists are real that's where you really need to fight the globalist

1258
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Because

1259
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Look dude

1260
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,711
As long as women don't have access to healthcare f***** Bridge

1261
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
You're right

1262
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Priority

1263
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
You have to understand

1264
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,159
I feel like I'm a big enough man to admit when I'm

1265
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:05,279
I appreciate that

1266
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,423
Try to get in the Waterfront

1267
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
People like that

1268
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,175
I have a financial incentive to do it but

1269
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Believe me

1270
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
It's just

1271
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:30,367
Let's listen to this again because I think it's no fun either way his

1272
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
Not on purpose

1273
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,439
Almost like he's ashamed

1274
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,767
The waterfront

1275
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
Whataburger

1276
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:48,031
So Alex has

1277
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
This is very much like

1278
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
People

1279
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
People of the ratings go up when I do it

1280
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
Chinese f******

1281
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,551
Subaru I don't think they do go up

1282
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
Even even is a shame is alive

1283
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,511
I think what he's talking about is the people scream about like whatever he screams people posted

1284
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,559
Adorama

1285
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Just like that

1286
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,983
He gets a lot of you gets run off traffic from people

1287
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
Will Faking outrage about it

1288
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,311
Alex

1289
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
It's going to be hateful

1290
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Who knows

1291
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,199
A the worst they have all these but Alex

1292
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,295
You know Facebook snowtorious for its Lefty policy

1293
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,879
Absolute interesting theory about that

1294
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Where they come from though

1295
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,863
Authoritarian

1296
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,335
Shut up

1297
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Understand

1298
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
Did it

1299
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
They can't

1300
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,631
High School

1301
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,495
They all want to end up

1302
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,823
Being cool and so the system

1303
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:32,991
System creates a system

1304
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,039
Wait I don't understand

1305
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
What.

1306
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
There's more to this clip but he's saying that these leftist weren't cool in high school

1307
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,119
They are because

1308
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,311
Alternative if you are cool

1309
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,871
Neither of you seem like great Prospect

1310
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,455
What's the best

1311
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,783
What's what's the best thing to be

1312
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,183
High School I don't know bang out 150 women in-depth an abortion

1313
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:19,583
Crack a couple times at a beach

1314
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,167
I don't know baby

1315
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
So there's that

1316
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,775
Or just moderate levels serving

1317
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,367
Sadistic

1318
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,463
You just making stuff up

1319
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
Dominic

01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,967
Celebrate

1322
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:12,831
Possible

1323
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
Young Thug

An example of anything near what it is

1329
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
I think it's just

1330
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
So a runoff from like

1331
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
Pick-up artist

1332
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Website

1333
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:57,375
Men's rights

1334
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:03,775
Right like I don't know I don't know what that means a real Alpha is that gif

1335
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Body trying to create bigger systems

1336
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
That doesn't make sense

1337
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:14,015
And if you were if you were if you were treated as a beta male but in reality mentally you were in Alpha

1338
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,623
Randomly throwing

1339
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:32,447
He seemed drugged up a little I think he's just

1340
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,287
Took too much Super Mario Land had a little too much

1341
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,383
Testosterone

1342
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,687
When you have a freak out that early

1343
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
You've got a lot of show left

1344
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,527
Yeah sorry I think he's going to places like

1345
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,855
I can feel time

1346
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
He calls in

1347
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
The helper

1348
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Ranger Michael

1349
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:59,327
I will never not love that he's called the health Ranger

1350
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,167
Does not advocate for a lot of things that are like

1351
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
Help healthy

1352
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,007
He's a vaccine

1353
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
Right

1354
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,079
Either either nonsense

1355
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Copilot

1356
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
He said something a little bit

1357
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
Made it to Ranger

1358
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,479
He doesn't have to do

1359
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,015
He said something a little later that is

1360
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,831
Very troubling

1361
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,623
Applications you need to become a park ranger

1362
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:25,695
I think it's just a pain I think it's a

1363
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:32,351
I've been becoming a to have a f****** degree you have to spend it like it's incredible I was

1364
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
Looking into it cuz I was like

1365
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:40,031
I like Mike Adams case I think

1366
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,127
No it's just a fun nickname

1367
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
And that is in how to butter Alex up

1368
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,831
And make sure that this interview goes totally fine

1369
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
This is something

1370
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,183
I didn't even mention I was going to mention this but

1371
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Reasons that you're on

1372
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
Awakened

1373
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:05,119
And so able to process information is because your Health Products

1374
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Actually

1375
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
Greatly enhance

1376
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,471
Neurological and cognitive function

1377
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:14,335
This leads to a half-hour influential

1378
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,127
Your products

1379
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Make you our audience

1380
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,199
More pliable

1381
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,991
That is healthy

1382
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,135
They make you susceptible to repetitive

1383
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,951
The other reason that

1384
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,231
One of the main reasons

1385
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,815
Mike Adams is on the show is because he his

1386
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:38,911
Yes he's the only Infowars guests with a non stupid name

1387
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,311
Boy howdy if you want to know about natural news and like Adams you could look into it a very rich history

1388
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,919
Birtherism Lake website

1389
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,711
For some reason they're posting articles about

1390
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
The Boston bombing being fake and

1391
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,063
Calpers

1392
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,647
Unhealthy to not be born in America

1393
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,487
He staked his claim here that he is really Furious

1394
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Where you going after David

1395
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
That sounds right

1396
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,583
He has made a website called

1397
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
Dot-com

1398
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,727
Now

1399
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,543
He had to spell it with two G's right

1400
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
Because

1401
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
Regular right I would assume

1402
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,391
If you go to this website it's basically it's basically a

1403
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,023
News websites that are all written by a couple of his employees for natural news

1404
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
And if all I want is a live web stream of whatever it is David Hogg

1405
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,263
Website that's created to harass

1406
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,943
Remember the park battle whenever those eggs

1407
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,991
I want the same thing

1408
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:00,831
Unfortunately this website

1409
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,135
I'm going to read you some of the headline

1410
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,207
The hard-hitting news that's being done here on hogwash

1411
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,607
If you enter the public Arena of ideas prepare to get burned

1412
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
Great

1413
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,911
Great good article

1414
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,751
That's a headline

1415
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,871
Another headline yet more proof that universities are social justice terrorist training camps

1416
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Another headline

1417
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:29,759
Dear David Hogg you're a lying opportunistic insufferable little toe tag

1418
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,551
A headline

1419
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:36,159
NRA board member Ted Nugent called Parkland student activists

1420
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,231
Liars quote have no soul

1421
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:44,095
Hey bro you adopted a seventeen-year-old so you could f*** her without her parents having anything

1422
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:44,863
To say about it

1423
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
He's probably calm down

1424
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Nugent

1425
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,983
The Rockstar lifestyle.

1426
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
What's going on here

1427
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
This guy is created

1428
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
Entire website

1429
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
Faced on harassing and

1430
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
Calling out

1431
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Bulshit

1432
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:04,831
I'm putting those articles their headlines I don't care to read the f****** content I don't even want to know what's in there

1433
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,111
Weather headlines

1434
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Personal insults

1435
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Or I hate

1436
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,487
You're getting little boy twerking to f*** you up

1437
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
All that succeeds in doing is

1438
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
Is not

1439
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
We throw shade at David Hogg

1440
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,703
This doesn't advance

1441
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,727
Either side of

1442
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
The gun debate

1443
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,311
Poop face

1444
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
Distant

1445
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
Possibly endanger David Hogg

1446
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
Like really

1447
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
If you think about it

1448
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,063
The only thing that this can do is radicalized

1449
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
People who might

1450
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Hurt him

1451
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:42,463
And I don't I don't think that's a good thing

1452
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,255
You can come up with some pawns like

1453
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:50,655
Really really lean into it

1454
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
Stuff right there

1455
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,031
On this on this episode

1456
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,615
Phil come on

1457
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,199
So pretty much the rest of the episode Alex is talking

1458
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
With Mike Adams

1459
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
AKA Valparaiso

1460
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,551
And

1461
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Alex makes

1462
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,367
This guy

1463
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
That you wants to be clear

1464
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,207
Only you can prevent vaccine

1465
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Alex

1466
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
Global is the vampires

1467
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Everybody wants to be clear by

1468
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Not literally

1469
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
Movie zombies at the bottom

1470
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
Some of that

1471
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:34,943
Animes about vampires above that

1472
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
So

1473
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,623
We got zombies Gremlins G Pires zombies

1474
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
Want to eat your brain

1475
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:47,743
Gremlins can't feed him after midnight

1476
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:56,703
Unfortunately last week on Alex Jones Show on March 20th

1477
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,287
Night he was sitting around with a gentleman by the name of Doug Hagmann

1478
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,335
I replayed it on the show already

1479
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
You can find it on

1480
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Bestbuy.com

1481
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
ITunes is glitching

1482
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,735
Play it

1483
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
Explains that he believes

1484
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
That the

1485
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,087
Elite

1486
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Want to put

1487
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,159
People's blood so they can drink it

1488
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:20,255
Narrative

1489
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
Right

1490
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
They need this is a busy need to spike it

1491
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
They can't they can't just drink it straight Dan

1492
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,567
Baptist East vet like

1493
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,103
We have two situations

1494
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
Going on

1495
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
And I just did Alex

1496
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Smaller things

1497
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,783
If you want to talk about

1498
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Look like

1499
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:47,647
Literal literal vampires

1500
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,719
You can go down the literal vampire Road and then you are a

1501
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
You're a f****** idiot

1502
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
Because you can look at

1503
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
Science about

1504
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,375
Weather adrenaline in blood changes

1505
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
Your effect

1506
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,215
Happens when you drink it

1507
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,751
It's been done and doorbell doesn't get you high

1508
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:06,847
Hunter S Thompson wrote about it

1509
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:12,991
Made up book made up a lot of

1510
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:16,063
The adrenochrome stuff a bunch of other

1511
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
Literary fix

1512
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,903
But it doesn't it doesn't

1513
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,815
It doesn't work out

1514
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Hogwash

Metaphorical vampires

Go to Vegas

1520
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199

You're not staying s***

1522
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,015
You're just talking.

1523
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:51,391
Mischaracterizing people in trying to demonize them without actually making a

1524
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
Antique lamps

1525
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
You can go

1527
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
Fascinating but Alex

Smashing

1529
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
Is Alex doing

1530
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
They're both stupid but I was like

1531
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
I don't want people to think I'm doing both

1532
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,263
I kind of

1533
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
And that's what he does

1534
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,823
Dip your toes in the boat world

1535
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,615

01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,503
Complaints about

1540
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
People bullying

1541
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:25,439

Our fourth amendment rights

1543
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,791

Do you tie rented nbcnews

1545

Receiving death threats

You haven't received

1554

I'd like to read to you from an article

1555
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,207

1557
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Cuz of the Parkland shooting

1558
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
But it's famous

1559
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Into a dangerous

1560
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
Situation for his

Received numerous alarming deathreats

1562
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
From individuals both

1563
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,031
In and outside of the country

1564
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
So is Mother Rebecca Baldrick contact

1565
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,615
The FBI after she got it

01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Disturbing message

1567
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
She should have had enough

1568
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,711
According to p.m.

1569
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:56,831
You should have had an abortion one user wrote your son is a psychopathic douchebag

1570
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
Drive the whole family over a cliff

1571
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
Just admit failure

1572
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
O'Doyle rules

1573
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,815
Another user threatened her saying quote never change your face

1574
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,839
Your whole family is

1575
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Suppose because of your peace

1576
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
The ship kid

1577
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,191
By the way his whole plan has backfired on

1578
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
I'm sure his birthday celebration

1579
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
Interesting event

1580
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:18,847
F*** you and him God bless the NRA and the right to bear arms

1581
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,871
Rock crab

1582
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,895
Stuck with idiots

1583
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
Styx

1584
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:26,783
So you saying it's the next step removed

1585
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,063
From getting a death threat

1586
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
And the reality of the

1587
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
World

1588
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
Promoting

1589
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
Creating a website entirely about harassing

1590
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
Bowie David Hogg

1591
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Memes like

1592
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,047
You don't understand

1593
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
Tale of the influence

1594
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
What's your playing with

1595
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,143
Like these people are pathetic

1596
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
This is

1597
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,471
This to me is inhuman

1598
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
Behavior and it's absolutely

1599
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Before anyone Compares me to Alex when he

1600
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,359
Literally says people are human

1601
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
I don't mean that

1602
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,663
I mean this

1603
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Is

1604
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
Intrinsically lacking events

1605
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,575
It is intrinsically lacking of

1606
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,647
Respect for other people's autonomy

1607
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,927
Their individuality

1608
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,719
And the fact that they exist

1609
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,279
If not as a thing

1610
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
But as a person

1611
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,095
Android like

1612
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,911
You're complaining about your imagined

1613
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,471
First Amendment rights being trampled on

1614
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
They aren't

1615
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,543
Can you compare that to

1616
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,127
At the same time

1617
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
You are allowed

1618
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
I have a website

1619
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
Specifically

1620
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,807
Casting aspersions

1621
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,855
On a seventeen-year-old

1622
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,903
Who is literally getting hundreds

1623
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
The death threats

1624
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
All the time

1625
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
And then bitching

1626
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
About how you feel

1627
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,327
Right it's the softest s*** in the world

1628
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
Yeah it's very pathetic

1629
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,215
I don't

1630
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:55,615
That's your first instinct as an empathetic human being

1631
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,991
Is to then lose empathy and be like

1632
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
Like that's

1633
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:06,623
That's my first instinct is like we don't want these people in

1634
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,391
Living

1635
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,791
.

1636
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,815
You were child

1637
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
Because the child is like

1638
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
Hey my friends.

1639
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,727
Yeah my friends were murdered

1640
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
The death

1641
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,127
Murdered

1642
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
It's just

1643
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
It's not

1644
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,551
It's not acceptable to them respond to that with a complete lack of them

1645
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,879
Because these people are our goings I've like

1646
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,671
There's something wrong

1647
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,023
Something very seriously wrong with somebody who is okay

1648
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,815
With typing off a message

1649
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
That says

1650
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,119
I want you to die

1651
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,423
Yeah it is not okay

1652
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
We've not done

1653
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,031
A good enough job of

1654
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,407
Not dealing with cuz I don't really know how you deal with it we stick it

1655
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
We should have years ago

1656
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,759
We probably gamergate was the

1657
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
Well know that wasn't

1658
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:13,183
The beginning other than that was the warning shot

1659
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,463
I think that what it is

1660
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,863
I don't know you want to take things seriously

1661
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,143
We should have seen this coming

1662
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
With the internet

1663
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,031
As Services where you could

1664
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
Anonymously example

1665
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,919
Play a character in

1666
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:34,687
Stuff like that

1667
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
Asthma

1668
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
True back on AOL

1669
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,087
Screen names on messenger

1670
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
Friendship

1671
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
We evolve

1672
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
To quickly from a technological

1673
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,255
And we didn't recognize

1674
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
The Reef

1675
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,815
Repercussions of the ramifications of it

1676
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
4 Ardis

1677
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
And

1678
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
Absolutely

1679
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:58,495
Flipside is really biting Us in the ass now

1680
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Kind of

1681
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,079
On it on a macro level

1682
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,615
Understandable

1683
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,479
Because when you think about it when you think about previous generation

1684
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,063
You do you go back to talking the greatest generation

1685
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,343
Their lives

1686
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,111
Material

1687
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
Work

1688
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
All that differ

1689
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,183
From their parents

1690
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
Which word

1691
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:20,255
From their parents

1692
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
The

1693
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
Acceleration of differ

1694
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
It's to the point where

1695
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,935
My life is completely the

1696
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,983
Thousand percent difference

1697
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,287
From somebody who is five years younger

1698
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,103
My life is completely different

1699
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,151
Growing up in a situation where

1700
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:46,623
I think someone is 29 is probably pretty close

1701
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,927
Well you and I are very close

1702
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,743
Yeah but consider somebody who grew up

1703
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
When Twitter was Domino

1704
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,423
Like as compared to grow up when the internet was exactly

1705
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,983
Even the same thing as like

1706
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
I don't know why my mind drifted to p***

1707
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
The difference between

1708
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,199
You coming up when the internet was just like you could

1709
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,247
Slowly upload pictures on it

1710
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,551
High-speed capabilities into

1711
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,087
Tube sites and stuff like that

1712
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,623
Like even fat

1713
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,671
Now you now

1714
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
You apply that level of difference

1715
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
2

1716
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,327
Munication

1717
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,863
Absolutely

1718
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,263
To the wrong place I don't know why but

1719
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:38,079
The driving force behind so many

1720
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,383
Spreads attack not like one of the things that

1721
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
Occurred after

1722
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,991
Like shortly after the invention of the printing press

1723
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
What are the main reason

1724
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,575
Isn't that so many people

1725
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:52,927
Like that was that was one of the ways that

1726
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:59,327
That's those so many of those intellectual books were spread through the same Underground

1727
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
Principio Mathematica

1728
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,935
We spread through the same underground Network as

1729
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
F******

1730
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:11,871
But Alex would stare at 4 hours was around back then

1731
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,431
So Jordan

1732
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,223
First long-form films

1733
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:20,319
That lasted you know you've you go back to the 1910s

1734
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,903
Well it lasted eight seconds and that was a miracle

1735
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,207
Simultaneously

1736
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:31,327
Like simultaneously the other films that last

1737
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,191
We're a dude f****** a lady in a

1738
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
SMS

1739
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
We got to move on to this neck

1740
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,079
Sorry

1741
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:46,943
I don't got a long and storied history and if you look into it it's

1742
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
Really very

1743
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,735
No for sure

1744
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,879
Can I see a cigarette from you

1745
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Thank you for a perp

1746
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
Yeah I would like a cigarette but also I'm asking you.

1747
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Because cigarettes

1748
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,775
Are carcinogenic

1749
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,567
And they cost

1750
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Cancer

1751
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,384
Mike Adams

1752
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,408
The health Ranger

1753
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Had some thoughts about cancer

1754
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
Guitar

1755
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:24,576
A little truck a little troubling thoughts about

1756
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:32,000
They know that you have cancer which is usually a fraud

1757
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:38,400
Medical Health

1758
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
Therapy is chemo brain

1759
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,984
The damages your brain function

1760
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,544
Damages your heart and your liver

1761
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:51,712
You undergo chemotherapy

1762
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:55,296
Which is why by the way one of our Supreme Court Justices

1763
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,112
But she underwent chemotherapy

1764
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,144
Chemotherapy which is based on chemical weapons

1765
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,056
Yeah she needs sheep she's just trying to hang in there so she can keep you know the liberal agenda going but

1766
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
Oh boy

1767
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,872
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1768
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Has

1769
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
Written

1770
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:28,320
Recent absolvement of guilt from from a police off

1771
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:34,464
Officer f****** acting with impunity when the Supreme Court to be like

1772
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,304
I didn't know he was breaking the law so that's

1773
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1774
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,960
This and any was brilliant

1775
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,824
Truly brilliant writer

1776
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
Read

1777
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Chemotherapy

1778
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,808
And I mean it is a poison

1779
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,088
You know it is much

1780
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:06,464
Cuz you have to write it's a drastic measure it Italy

1781
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,512
And that's the issue with a lot of

1782
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
Medicine

1783
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:16,448
It's like that famous bowls

1784
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,312
Health science articles where they write about how

1785
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,152
People use a scientist doctor's used malaria

1786
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,688
To help fight HIV

1787
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,248
Like that kind of level of

1788
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,808
Sometimes in order to kill something

1789
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
You have to

1790
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,112
Use something that kills

1791
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,672
It reminds me of the show House m.d.

1792
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
It's a far more relevant

1793
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:44,608
There was a commercial For an upcoming episode but I'll never forget

1794
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
House by the way

1795
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,192
I knew that from your smart

1796
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,496
From your Harrison 40in smart

1797
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:54,336
It's a great show episode

1798
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
The preview was

1799
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
In order to

1800
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200
Favorites page

1801
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,392
Overdrive

1802
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
Adelaide

1803
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,000
I got it I got it

1804
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,608
Hugh Laurie is so good

1805
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,520
The only podcast

1806
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:29,920
Now cuz I'll be God damned if I know what's going on half the time for importantly the issue that I have

1807
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Okay so

1808
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Now

1809
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
Mike Adams

1810
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,784
Introduce the worldview where

1811
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
The opinions of

1812
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:42,208
Anyone who's gotten chemotherapy are disqualified because they can't think anymore

1813
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,792
Usually actually just as something to convince you you have

1814
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Scam

1815
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,400
Amazing

1816
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,984
This is the level of stuff like when I said I don't want to get into like

1817
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
The natural news

1818
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
Mike Adams

1819
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
Probably because I knew that clip

1820
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,128
Who's coming up right and partly because it's

1821
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,944
Medical nonce

1822
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,272
We would have another hour of the show by when

1823
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,904
His f****** resume audiology

1824
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
Putting people with hearing aids

1825
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,792
And I remember when one person came in and they were like

1826
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,632
Well I'm not going to see you for a long time we're going to Florida

1827
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,192
If we had a my daughter and I asked

1828
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
Have Lyme disease

1829
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,544
And we're going to go see a

1830
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,568
Ternative medicine

1831
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
Therapist

1832
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
And I was like

1833
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,664
No

1834
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
GoNoodle

1835
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
Are you idiot

1836
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
It'd be good

1837
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,136
Even if you don't trust him go and then go to the other guy too

1838
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:48,256
Well but they're going to convince you that you have double lines

1839
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,792
That's what

1840
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,096
Yeah so you know

1841
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,400
Mike Adams a talking a lot of bulshit and

1842
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
Running websites

1843
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,448
Fiscally design

1844
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Harasses 70

1845
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,240
Funeral

1846
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,592
Low super adult about why

1847
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
My people are attacked

1848
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:14,880
If they were really strong they wouldn't mind our voices being out there because we would be unconvincing to people

1849
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,696
The reason

1850
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:22,304
You are making so much sense that you're awake

1851
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:28,448
You are a danger to their agenda

1852
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,824
I would posit that the reality is

1853
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Is it yours Spitta

1854
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
Propaganda

1855
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Appeals to

1856
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Bass

1857
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,224
The people are very worried about the implication

1858
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
Ofsted proper

1859
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
Buganda and how it seems

1860
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:43,808
Have its roots

1861
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,344
Sandwiches and white nationalism

1862
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:48,160
Christian identity movement those sort of thing

1863
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
You know generally when you look it up

1864
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
End result

1865
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,352
Is generally

1866
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,168
Murdering minority

1867
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,008
I'm so that's really it and end your argument is persuasive

1868
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
Because you play on their fears

1869
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
Is it the same way

1870
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,104
Do you know you present yourself

1871
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
The populist

1872
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
I mean they are able to

1873
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,968
Trigger people

1874
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,992
Reality

1875
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
That's not who you are at all

1876
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,392
Say this all the time I absolutely dis

1877
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Despised

1878
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
The word

1879
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
The pop

1880
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,048
Yeah it is it is a

1881
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,352
Disgusting moniker that is

1882
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Thrown about in order to

1883
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,680
Invalidate

1884
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
I really really don't

1885
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,592
What what we should use the word we should

1886
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
Use it

1887
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
These guys

1888
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Case is

1889
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
Fascist f****** moron

1890
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
That's one word

1891
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,272
Okay I made it

1892
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
Will get that into Webster's

1893
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:55,744
I love that line though the the idea that like a tech

1894
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
What happens

1895
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,448
That was true

1896
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
We are in Desperate days

1897
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:10,848
One of the reasons that you're stupid

1898
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,920
The next trip is going to be controversial

1899
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,736
I will take on it but I think is actually all

1900
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,504
Alternative

1901
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,528
YouTube

1902
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
My

1903
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:21,088
Like the Smashing

1904
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,648
What a lot of people have a position on this

1905
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,672
Attacking Alex

1906
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,464
I'm going to

1907
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,256
Unpopular League defend him

1908
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,304
A little bit afterward

1909
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:36,704
Classic Denton

1910
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,800
Be the guardian of everything and

1911
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,360
Somebody keeping people on Trump

1912
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,384
That's not what happened

1913
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,736
Border

1914
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:54,112
Which is exactly

1915
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,648
Supposed to be

1916
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
Visiting inside baseball

1917
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,536
Real quick

1918
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,328
I'm going to go ahead and

1919
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,632
Just deal with this ahead of Alex

1920
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Seth bullshitted

1921
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
But

1922
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
He's talking about Trump

1923
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Troop

1924
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
To the Border

1925
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,176
It's in response to a national

1926
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,040
Yeah it's in response

1927
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:23,808
Service ideas

1928
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,344
Does a caravan have like 1000

1929
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:30,208
Central America recognizing

1930
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:30,976
Pretending

1931
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
It's a group

1932
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
The does the to raise awareness

1933
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,888
Of the plight of people in Central America

1934
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
And they've done this

1935
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
20 temp

1936
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:46,336
It's a it's a

1937
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,616
Dispersed

1938
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Caravan

1939
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,456
The idea that Trump is

1940
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Responding

1941
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
Intuit

1942
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:55,040
In a way that's so opportunistic

1943
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,064
So

1944
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
Triggering of races

1945
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:06,304
That part I'm really again and I'm again

1946
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
The idea of putting military On the Border

1947
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
In order to

1948
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,656
Defend against

1949
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:11,424
Immigrant

1950
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,448
Or what

1951
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:13,984
But

1952
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
I need be very clear about this

1953
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,800
Because a lot of people

1954
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,592
Tons of articles about this

1955
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,896
Happy birthday saying that Alex is such a

1956
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
F****** hypocrite

1957
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,248
Because he would scream about the Posse Comitatus Act

1958
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
And about how the

1959
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,064
Military

1960
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Supposed to operate

1961
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Plastic soil

1962
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
In terms of domestic

1963
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,928
Operate

1964
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,208
Right hand.

1965
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,744
Enforcing law enforcement

1966
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
Stop in the United States

1967
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,560
Rubicon Crossing

1968
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
To the Constitution

1969
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
It says

1970
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
In terms of the armed services

1971
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,984
Quote to provide

1972
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
Calling forth

1973
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,032
The militia

1974
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,824
To execute the laws of the Union

1975
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
Suppress interact

1976
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,128
The repel invasion

1977
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,688
I think it's insulting

1978
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,760
Statement in an Uber

1979
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,784
2

1980
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,576
Insinuate that these immigrants

1981
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Coming up our

1982
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,416
Invasion

1983
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
This is not the part I'm just

1984
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,744
Yeah the part I'm defending

1985
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
The Posse Comitatus

1986
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
It's very clear

1987
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,608
Then what they're talkin about

1988
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
The army

1989
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,400
And the Air Force

1990
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,448
They are not talking

1991
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,728
About the National Guard

1992
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
The National Guard

1993
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
Very clearly

1994
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,568
Can be called a

1995
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
If

1996
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
The state Governor allows

1997
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
The state Governor has two welcome

1998
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
The used

1999
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,272
Of the National Guard in their state

2000
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,808
And then it's okay for them

2001
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
To operate

2002
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
In terms of

2003
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:41,536
It has been done in the normal thing when you when you hear

2004
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:45,888
They called in the National Guard right that's exactly what that mean

2005
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,704
I took the idea that Trump is sending the National Guard

2006
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472
Enforced

2007
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,496
The border is

2008
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Troubling

2009
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,312
But it's not hypocritical for Alex

2010
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,592
To be okay with that

2011
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,128
And not be okay with

2012
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
Let's de Jade House

2013
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,688
Even though Jade Helm Osaka

2014
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,480
Stupid now is wrong about that

2015
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,016
It's not a

2016
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,552
Complete contradiction

2017
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,576
Of his principal

2018
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,368
The way a lot of people representing

2019
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
Because it is the National Guard

2020
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
It's not

2021
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,976
The same thing

2022
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,328
Also I understand but and strongly disagree with his idea that

2023
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,656
The South the people to protect

2024
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,448
But if that were the case

2025
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:22,496
Dushyanth does they the military camp

2026
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,288
And then further

2027
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,824
The Posse Comitatus Act

2028
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
Does allow

2029
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
4

2030
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
The presidents

2031
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,920
To unilaterally

2032
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,992
The federal laws are being broken

2033
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
And they can use

2034
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,576
Is the military it has been done in the past

2035
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,344
Like the white eyes and

2036
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,624
An hour

2037
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,904
Bringing in troops

2038
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,952
To allow for the segregate segregation

2039
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,744
The school stuff like that

2040
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,304
The president does have unilateral Authority

2041
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
To break

2042
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,352
Comitatus

2043
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,680
Now Alex would never give that leeway to any other president

2044
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:56,032
And so it's hypocritical of him to be okay with the sort of thing

2045
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
It's it's

2046
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:57,824
Trend against

2047
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,360
He stood for in the past

2048
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,920
But if we're being totally fair to him

2049
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,456
It's not

2050
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,248
It's not what people are making it out to be

2051
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,552
You are a scholar of Alex Jones

2052
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,856
And I would bet

2053
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:12,416
All of the money that I've ever made

2054
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,440
And have

2055
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:18,304
That he that if you look for it you could find a clip where he said bringing in the Nash

2056
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,072
National Guard

2057
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Is

2058
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:24,704
Illegal or whatever we look through all of the years that Obama was President

2059
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,496
You would find that

2060
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,032
Yeah and in that case yes

2061
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
We could point out the literal of hawk

2062
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,640
But again as we've gone over it

2063
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
Matter

2064
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,944
And

2065
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,016
I don't think could you sing this based on Prince

2066
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
But

2067
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
We

2068
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,624
To be fair

2069
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,904
Our mission statement

2070
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,440
To paint him in a bad light for things

2071
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,464
He doesn't deserve

2072
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
And I'll defend him against

2073
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
Bike

2074
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
These like articles that I've seen

2075
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,352
Post that I've seen

2076
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,168
He's abandoned Olive

2077
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Is Prince

2078
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Because he's okay with

2079
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,472
The National Guard

2080
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:04,128
His principles

2081
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:09,248
This is this I think is

2082
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,528
For real

2083
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,088
A little bit later bike Adam says

2084
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,368
Is it because of

2085
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,392
So many immigrants

2086
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,416
In California they should

2087
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:22,816
Have their senators and Congress people taken away which is Adams is the dumbest motherfuker I think I've ever heard it's not good

2088
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,608
This is insane

2089
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
Next clip

2090
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,424
Let me ask you a

2091
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,240
Academy

01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,312
Sell a product of some sort that he claims

2093
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Will

2094
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
Cure can

2095
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,128
I'm almost certain

2096
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,736
I can't confirm or deny that but I suspect

2097
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:41,760
Yeah

2098
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,040
Send a text with

2099
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
Alex Jones

2100
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
The liberal meme

2101
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,904
Oh that liberal media

2102
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,696
Very specific way

2103
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
But I'm actually eight

2104
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
I know exact

2105
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,024
Actually what are you talkin about

2106
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
Pretty interesting

2107
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:58,912
This Is War

2108
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,984
21st century

2109
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:08,384
Coffee

2110
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
Alex Jones and Sean is a captive

2111
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:18,624
Squash

2112
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,376
Start in Sinclair broadcasting is that whole thing and never been on one

2113
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:36,288
Not one Sinclair station TV station

2114
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,824
They just pushed

2115
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
You saying that the leftist media is saying

2116
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,688
The only person

2117
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,736
Who is made both of those claims

2118
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
Is his ex-wife

2119
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,624
He is trying to say that things that Kelly has

2120
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,416
Quit it out from her own account

2121
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,744
He's describing them to the leftist media

2122
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,304
She tweeted out the towers got his start on

2123
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,328
Sinclair radio

2124
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
And I do not believe that

2125
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:02,912
No that doesn't

2126
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:06,752
I don't know for sure and I will Cop 2

2127
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
The fact that

2128
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
She was around then

2129
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,360
You may have a better awareness that I do

2130
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:16,992
S****** f****** signs a contract details

2131
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,040
To come out of my position would change

2132
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,088
But from everything I can tell from the Reeser

2133
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,112
Search that's available

2134
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
Alex Jones

2135
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,904
Existed on

2136
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,440
JFK

2137
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,000
Sponsors

2138
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,048
Network

2139
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,584
And then when he got fired

2140
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,376
He got picked up and syndicated

2141
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Play home radio station

2142
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
He was running

2143
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Aunt Jen

2144
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,312
I don't know if there's any

2145
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
Sinclair

2146
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,128
Influence that I can

2147
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
Confined

2148
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,176
In his

2149
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:50,016
Early days of radio

2150
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,040
Did learn about it

2151
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
But it does

2152
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,088
Like this

2153
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,880
Is more capitalized

2154
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
On the fact that people

2155
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
Complaining

2156
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:00,000
Sinclair come up

2157
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,536
Now of all time

2158
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:07,168
Right because there was that video that of all the people saying the exact same thing

2159
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
Jump on it which again

2160
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,008
That video

2161
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,080
Exact same thing it was on John Oliver like a year ago

2162
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
Think everyone getting like

2163
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Massively

2164
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,968
Retweet this good good

2165
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,272
Let's get more awareness about that but don't pretend

2166
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,296
Is the first timer

2167
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,344
But be that as it may

2168
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,624
I think it's very disgrace

2169
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:28,928
Things that is

2170
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
Ex-wife is tweeting

2171
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Liberal media

2172
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,280
Well she's been compromised by the globe

2173
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
Well I

2174
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
Now

2175
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,168
His son has probably been brainwashed and is used as a

2176
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:44,544
Probably not Sinclair Sinclair media behind that

2177
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,360
That's another thing I don't have this clip there's another point where

2178
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Hitman Mike

2179
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,408
You're talking about the YouTube

2180
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
YouTube shooting

2181
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456
Heather talking about how they

2182
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,784
Hey was YouTube taking away all these people's channels

2183
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,696
Did you know they're putting their employees at risk

2184
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,792
Shootings like this could happen with people who have had their livelihoods taken away

2185
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:10,400
Do you not see the 121 parallel of putting your son on air in Aiken

2186
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,448
Contentious gun debate issue

2187
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,752
They're the way you're putting him at risk

2188
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,544
But I don't understand because

2189
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312
Dissonance

2190
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
It's their butt

2191
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
Who knows

2192
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,664
Should be the name of Alex's

2193
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,456
Attribute tattooed on his f******

2194
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,480
Can forehead

2195
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,320
Called cognitive call cognitive dissonance

2196
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:33,440
We have a couple clips left

2197
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,256
Yeah in this next clip Alex

2198
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,328
Pretend he's going to DC they only do Highwaymen

2199
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:42,912
The great is there Alex McCabe

2200
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:45,472
Covers of covers

2201
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,800
So that means talkative isthmus

2202
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:52,384
In this in his neck with Alex pretends that the reason he's going to do

2203
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,688
He's going to do a parlay

2204
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:01,856
Stringer Bell

2205
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:08,256

And being here in person with you and it being on a similar

2208
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,216
Battle pass

2209
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:23,616
You cannot be bought with money or so far

2210
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:27,712
Liberty bar country with money

2211
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112

Like what

2216
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:12,256
Everybody knows those aliens are from a different planet

2217
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,352
The CIA told me the story

2218
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:25,568
Play right there

2219
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,848
Launch into the bet

2220
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:30,176
He's about to launch into that old Street

2221
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:33,504
The CIA goes in there and they're like you have to kill your wife

2222
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:46,560
And she pulls the trigger and she finds out it's a blank so she has to beat her husband to death

2223
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,352
The old B

2224
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:53,728
Is it older the doctor was

2225
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:57,824
Yeah absolutely I don't think by the way

Lozes with that great job

2229
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,248
Also he's

2230
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:09,088
The transfer I will never work with him again

2231
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,136
Big

Bertha Street joke

2237
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
One time I was like

2238
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Who was it

2239
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:26,752
I am I going to say

2240
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,824
I would say as to that

2241
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,592
Clip

2242
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,616
That's not what I

2243
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,920
Alex's doing he was about to try and launch a

2244
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
To some fake

2245
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,968
Story that he is

2246
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,600
Sound like a you know I'm going to give you the inside

2247
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Hireright

2248
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,184
Yes he couldn't get the details of the bluff

2249
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
He was about to

2250
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,768
Better to make this

2251
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
Conspiratorial

2252
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:55,424
It's disgraceful

2253
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:59,520
I'll leave it there so you guys think I've ever spoken to a CIA

2254
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:04,896
Robert David Steele

2255
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:11,296
Child Slaves by the globalist

2256
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:15,904
It's the other aliens that we need to be worried about

2257
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,744
We can take you to Mars come on man you know what's fun about a lot of Alex

Gast

2259
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
Their past

2260
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,352
Are unverifiable

2261
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,680
Superfund

2262
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:32,800
Fitbit super f*** the way they even like doctor group says he's involved in secret program

2263
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,592
No way to confirm that

2264
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:41,760
About everything huge fan of Alex just

2265
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:48,160
Anytime somebody says something absolutely crazy they all just sign off overnight likes

2266
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
Just like

2267
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,728
This delicious

2268
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,264
I did this piece

2269
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
Of

2270
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:11,968
Good

2271
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,760
S*** what was it

2272
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:15,808
No it's gone

2273
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:27,840
Keep track of all the thoughts and therefore sometimes

2274
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,144
Something about the globalist

2275
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,496
Stalin

2276
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Who's that

2277
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,568
No it wasn't selling it was a

2278
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,616
No no it was the Italian

2279
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,176
Dictator who always made the report

2280
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,224
Was it Mussolini locksmith

2281
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,624
Auto Care

2282
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
That's terrible

2283
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,184
I'm sorry Goodrich

2284
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,280
Certainly made up

2285
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:00,352
Burglary

2286
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:04,704
I appreciate your attempts to somehow try and save me

2287
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,776
Forgetting what I was trying to say

2288
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
To do with

2289
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:14,944
Appreciate you immediately

2290
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,736
I'm happy about it

2291
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
In this next clip this is our last

2292
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,576
Alex Jones

2293
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:23,136
In the middle of talking about how the globalist

2294
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:28,768
Not recruiting George Washington

2295
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,328
Because he was one of the best

2296
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,864
He was

2297
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,424
He was one of the best in the business

2298
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,872
That's just for contacts

2299
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:49,504
Because of what I just said is

2300
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
How far

2301
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,856
Global Sumerian times

2302
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,648
As far as I can tell

2303
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:00,000
That seems like a good time

2304
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:06,656
Transdimensional demon idea that Alex is telling about like that's how the globalist get their marching orders

2305
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,728
Then yeah you could go back to like reading stitching

2306
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,008
And thinking about you

2307
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:15,872
This dumb idea about the Anunnaki and what happened

2308
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,432
I didn't start all the way back

2309
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:21,504
But because they have time travel and can

2310
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,808
Communicate with inter-dimensional beings

2311
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,856
They could have gone back in time

2312
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,392
And got George Washington

2313
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,952
But I'm going to go with Bill and Ted's

2314
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:40,448
They Coulda got George Washington to go to man

2315
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:47,104
Is not a great guy is about

2316
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:51,200
How Jeff Bezos has sort of a googly eye

2317
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,480
And

2318
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,016
How to breathe

2319
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:59,136
A little bit of a cross-eyed man I found this to be

2320
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,016
Marine creature of the deep with iPods

2321
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:35,488
Agenda

2322
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,584
So Alex says you can Google it and you can look up a VR wrist

2323
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,120
Socratic I I did that

2324
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:43,424
If you Google you don't really find anything

2325
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:47,008
From England or Britain or anything like that but you do find that in Mayan

2326
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
Realization

2327
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,848
Highly desired physical trait

2328
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,896
Cross-eyed

2329
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Suspended

2330
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,688
Between the eyes of theirs

2331
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Artificial

2332
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,016
Desire cross-eyed traits

2333
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:00,320
It it wasn't

2334
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,856
Some favorite and have a good for

2335
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Haven't

2336
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
Was considered

2337
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,976
Knish

2338
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:10,048
The cross-eyed Mayan sun god also known as the

2339
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:10,816
Sean Lourdes

2340
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,120
In order to appease in his favor

2341
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,656
Because of this it was also can

2342
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,424
Consider god-like

2343
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
Is well

2344
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,008
That's the only reference I can

2345
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,032
Confined for

2346
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,824
Cross eyes being valued by fidlar

2347
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,104
Relationship

2348
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,200
All religions go back to some weird dude that people are just like

2349
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,736
Seems right to me

2350
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,976
Show me religions are based on

2351
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:44,096
It's this whole thing where oh course your God is cross-eyed what would be

2352
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:48,192
The only the only one that doesn't work for is in Grecian

2353
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,240
Society like looking up

2354
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,008
Hephaestus

2355
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
Cuz he had a limp

2356
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:57,152
He was physically flawed

2357
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,432
Endearing

2358
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:02,016
Able to create any magical piece of

2359
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:06,880
Armor or weapons machinery

2360
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,648
Like

2361
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,928
You know the Greeks

2362
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Certainly didn't

2363
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:14,048
Admire physical deformity

2364
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,840
The thought their gods were assholes

2365
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,936
Wow amazing things about the Greek pantheon is

2366
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
It's like bottle

2367
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:25,568
Well very few of the Greek pantheon was always like

2368
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,616
Cheese's guys would you

2369
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:32,736
Cut it out you guys are killing us

2370
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
Throwing

2371
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,552
Lightning bolt

2372
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,856
And you're an immortal app

2373
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:40,416
When you f*** that lady is a swan

2374
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,232
That's where the history of the idea of God

2375
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,256
Referring as a

2376
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
It's not judeo Christian

2377
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:48,864
You consider Grecian

2378
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,144
Being a part of that but it

2379
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
Super Bali

2380
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,984
Theater

2381
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:59,872
The other thing I want to bring up his Alex at the end says it's called the aristocratic I and what I see

2382
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,152
Pinkie Pie be getting confused

2383
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
Pinterest

2384
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,712
If you look up

2385
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,760
If you Google the aristocratic I

2386
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,784
It's just

2387
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,832
Two bunch of articles about Monical's

2388
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
It's Alex

2389
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:20,096
Using that love me and Monica people who are upper-class British war

Give me a Monopoly man every possible that's where he's getting

2391
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:29,824
Brings us to the end of this episode. Triggered I'm not offended by him making fun of cross IP

2392
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,360
Because I have a lazy eye

2393
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,640
Entrepreneurship

2394
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:33,920
I'm over that

2395
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,968
I grew out of that a long time ago

2396
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,016
Grown out of

2397
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:41,088
Stupid

2398
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,880
Stop

2399
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,464
Gilbert Gottfried roast 911

2400
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,024
Are you making a bad documentary

2401
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,864
I will never grow out of Alex Jones is misrepresentation

2402
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,888
End of the world around him

2403
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,680
Grow out of Alex's

2404
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:00,032
His lies about George Soros I don't have any vested interest in defending

2405
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,568
Other than

2406
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,104
Just I hate this sort of s***

2407
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,432
I will never grow out of Mike Adams

2408
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,456
Being stupid all

2409
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,272
And Alex a known vampires

2410
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,296
Mike Adams

2411
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:16,928
Really f****** dumb

2412
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:17,952
We are presenting

2413
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:22,816
Crazy how stupid he is a mess because

2414
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,352
Xena I don't know

2415
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:28,960
With our constant stupid

2416
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,728
Hastings

2417
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,776
It's f****** stupid though he's evil

2418
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,312
Here's one of the reasons I know that

2419
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,896
Yeah all of his articles that he wrote on

2420
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
Universal Credit

2421
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:45,088
All the Articles you wrote on naturalnews.com about how the Boston

2422
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,440
What is the boilerplate website

2423
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:56,864
You know I wrote These when I was a political activist today

2424
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,144
Then that is all about hell

2425
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,704
He doesn't say hey this is embarrassing

2426
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,496

Rice

2429
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,592
This was from

2430
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:12,992
Back then I'm now a different person who's on a health committee

2431
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:18,368
On a different missive missions that idea

2432
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,904
Requires intentionality

2433
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:20,928
And ice

2434
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
I think it makes

2435
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
Anyway

2436
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,304

01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:51,136
It's really helping I feel like a bracket

2443
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:53,696
I feel like we got a lot more votes than I was expecting

2444
01:50:53,952 --> 01:51:00,096
Second-round will be coming soon

2445
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,120
Have a lot of close races

2446
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:01,888
It's me

2447
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,912
But I will see
