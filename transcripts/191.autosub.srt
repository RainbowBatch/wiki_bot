Alex

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,056
Beverages

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,224
Thoroughly by Alex Turner

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
Twitter

5
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
We came up afterlife

6
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Episode

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Being

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
If he had done this thing

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Same things

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,192
Then he did on those other platforms on Twitter when their rules are what they are now

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
They would kick

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,520
Take him off which sounded like a pretty good argument

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Like

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
I would believe that Alex

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
Cuz more careful with what he posts

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
Okay, but it turns out it's not

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,792
Cool revealing themselves

18
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
To be first up

19
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,496
Not because of this incident but Twitter has a hardcore history of being that that

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Alright guy

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
Hardcore history

22
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,160
Another podcast too long is the only one that we can really

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
Knox

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
There's only so many hours in the day

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
I'm not sure if you have time for us

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,336
Is good stuff good stuff speaker good stuff

27
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
I know a lot about you

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
That's why I would like to give a shout out to

29
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Very exciting

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Stafford

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768

Last

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
So I believe

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Another Chris

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Confused

37
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
What would we got we got a bunch of Georgia

38
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,688
We got a lot of Georgia's where the biggest George podcast

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
In the world I think

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
We got we got a lot of overlap

41
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
That is okay alright people let's fire you from the New York Times or whatever it is people are doing now

42
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:51,008
Early advocate for white genocide

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
No judgement

44
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,712
Damn you know.

45
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Mike those are

46
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Those are your McDonald's

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
No judgement

48
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
You didn't choose it

49
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
Picture of it started off everyday

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
We talked about Alex Badoo

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
Give a plug to our phone line

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
You can call us and leave a message

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384

Restart the show at like 2

56
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,392
Hard for this

57
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
The greatest thing that ever happened to you

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Hi Danny this is Jack also from Chico California I can verify that policy block Devin is

59
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,032
California

60
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688

61
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
Coming for you

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Make all of this go away

63
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
Still mine and policy demands for Elijah go in Chico California

64
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
End of my audio Ransom note

65
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
Do Morton Baker episode

66
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191

69
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,735
Phone number

70
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
I will take a hundred percent those both came from 530i code so it's not like people pretend

71
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Pending

72
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
From Chico

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
It's not

74
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
How many of our listeners are American

75
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
I can't figure

76
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,663
I could give you a firm number on that was it

77
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
20%

78
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Chico's

79
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
That's not after people from

80
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,975
From the town of a random phone number because of

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
We probably have as many people who listen to Athens

82
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Chicago's we do in

83
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Chicago

84
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
I have to wait a little while to play those

85
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Set the chico out-of-the-way Forest

86
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Will never clear the chico.

87
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
My friend

88
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,503
To go through call

89
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Bzak

90
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Information source

91
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Secondary

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
We got to do this show and Chico baby

93
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
I don't think we can do

94
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
About

95
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
You were too rather than

96
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Like

97
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
And say that you'll go to the

98
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Authorities

99
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
To take us down

100
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
Instead go to the authorities

101
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
Tell them to pay for RV

102
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,783
Sure I will do travel

103
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Operator

104
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
So I'm the first call to the other Chico

105
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Episode

106
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,143
From Zack

107
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Has Jim Bakker ever been on Project

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
Not that I can tell

109
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
But

110
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
We can only honor one of these people's request

111
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
We can combine them like

112
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Speculating might be possible

113
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Let's see which one we're doing

114
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
We're so smart

115
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
Look at the mess America's Inn

116
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
Blithe

117
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
You have made it about

118
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
We're so smart

119
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
We control all aspects

120
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,823
And look what kind of bachelor in business crazy

121
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,271
Real interesting parallels with the World of Alex Jones

122
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Specific

123
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
That will get into as it goes along

124
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Crazy

125
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
So it's going to be

126
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Anderson

127
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,543
I am dating your contract hair with

128
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
Because of the bartender

129
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Surprise

130
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
Is Mark Zuckerberg

131
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
With that

132
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
Familiar

133
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Intro jingle

134
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
And welcome to the Jim Bakker Show

135
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Please give a warm welcome to my dad and the baker

136
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
Welcome to Grace Street

137
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Today

138
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,343
Good to be here was the co-host

139
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
She said she was a cold stuff

140
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
No she's not even enough and also a singer

141
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
I don't think they play Tai Chi like

142
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
If you go back to the

143
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
Early stuff on Jim Baker's youth

144
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
YouTube channel

145
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,759
She's fine time in a day

146
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Can do with it

147
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
And not

148
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
5-minute videos of Tammy Sue Bakker singing head to get a pass

149
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
She actually is

150
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
Concrete

151
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,215
Yeah it's okay there

152
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Okay

153
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Just passed away

154
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
It's sad

155
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Left up eclipse for Jim is talking about it

156
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Because it's so gross

157
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
To hear like

158
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Human moment from him

159
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Haha

160
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Survival box

161
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,975
It's not it doesn't seem sincere

162
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:41,119
Hey I had the best in-laws in the world or whatever

163
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
Later he's going to try and get you to buy

164
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
Can ionizing water bottle

165
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
13 years of

166
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
Actually drove me to not include that stuff

167
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
Humanizing in some way even though

168
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Brings a little bit

169
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Shoei

170
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
Is that I watched another episode of his show

171
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Yeah it was

172
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,791
We're not going

173
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Was it was after Hurricane

174
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Harvey

175
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
He was running a

176
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
Promotion

177
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Did you buy a bucket

178
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,687
You get a bucket one goes to Hurricane Harvey relief

179
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Anyway

180
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
Gross which makes me wonder what the markup is

181
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
It's probably

182
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Exorbitantly heard the name

183
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Billet

184
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
It looks like

185
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Looks like boy

186
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
But its Billet

187
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
No I have never heard of Mark Bila

188
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
No one has that side

189
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
Very Fringe weirdo community

190
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
But he's on the show cuz he's got a book

191
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
30 +

192
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
Interesting Lee Jim says biswas

193
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
To do its business model

194
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
I have something that's been

195
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Affected

196
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
For quite a while

197
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
I stopped endorsing books

198
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,999
Six months or a year ago

199
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Yes we said absolutely no more books

200
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Because we lost our shirt on books

201
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
That's pretty

202
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
Pretty wild

203
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Budget Rental

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
Reply I'm ahead of time usually and then if they don't sell

205
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,199
And ever since we've been selling more books than any Ministry in in in America

206
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:36,063
Is that crazy

207
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
But this is an unusual book

208
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
What's

209
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,255
And it opens up are you ready to go on the most thrilling adventure of your life

210
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
Good to me there's nothing more exciting than a treasure hunt

211
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
And where about

212
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
To embark on what we're going to do that

213
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
On this program.

214
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,359
That's exciting is this Jesus Vines

215
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
So I don't know if you picked up all the pieces there but what happens if books on

216
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,647
Spec yeah Consignment prices

217
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
Hey what's up

218
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
He's not been able to move these f***

219
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
So he's been taking a condom

220
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
With the book

221
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
We're just going with the bucket

222
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Can't do the books anymore

223
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
These weirdos to come on my show are not good enough writers

224
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
We can't do it but this guy

225
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Mark biltz

226
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Lured him back into the world

227
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
The book

228
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Because I

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Differently I guess iPhone

230
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
We're no longer endorsing book

231
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Because we lost our shirt

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
And ever since we stopped

233
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
Losing ever since we've stopped

234
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Endorsing books

235
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,447
Now we've sold more books than any other Christian Ministry

236
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
But you have to

237
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Considers that he's an old crazy rainbow

238
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Doesn't make sense as that

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
We stopped selling books

240
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
It would imply that they could all of the books

241
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
That they had bought

242
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
Before or whatever

243
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
I guess it's an inch

244
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Interesting business model

245
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
You running but it's the same thing with like the America

246
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
For Prosperity buying up all of like Shawn

247
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Books

248
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Stuff like that it is or the right-wing me

249
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Media model

250
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Betty's doing

251
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
So

252
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
In effect what

253
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
He's doing is paying these people to be on his show

254
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,895
There's a financial incentive for them to come on the show because those books are bought

255
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Jim Baker's buying those books

256
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
They don't have to worry about the audience

257
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Yeah they're not buying books

258
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
From the guest

259
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Anymore

260
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Once they come on the show there

261
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Jim Stafford

262
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
So

263
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
That's a really f***** up relationship to have

264
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
People's book

265
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Is because he's selling his own

266
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
Supply

267
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
To be an advertising

268
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Tool of gyms

269
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Yeah

270
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Gratitude

271
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
10000 copy

272
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,879
So you're saying with Americans

273
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
A prospect

274
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:25,279
Towards how many books are sold to the public hasn't sold them

275
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,119
There

276
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
I mean ten thousand bucks

277
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
I'm going to get you on

278
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,615
In addition to other places they're probably doing the same thing you might be able to rack up

279
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Something close to a best

280
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
It's all very

281
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:53,183
We still don't know exactly what Mark is talking about imply that nobody

282
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Who watches

283
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Jim Bakker knows how to read

284
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,631
There's a worse percentage than the general public probably correlation does not equal causation

285
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
But there's a high correlation

286
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Forget how to read

287
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:14,175
Emergency with this guy's book is about

288
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Partially

289
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
Mark biltz is here with us he's the manager

290
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
Discovered the blood moons I guess

291
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
And

292
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
So much is going on

293
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
So much

294
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
What's happening in our presidency what's happening in our country

295
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,935
We are in serious trouble

296
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
I believe

297
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
America

298
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
Has got to stop mocking God

299
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,663
President who wants to stop killing babies

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
That's what they do that's what about in this country

301
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Oh yeah

302
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Who ever heard of

303
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
Destroying a president

304
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
In his first week

305
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:14,591
It's really it's really fun cuz we're 2009 and Alex started making The Obama Deception

306
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,151
Before and Audra

307
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Negative

308
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
Seagate

309
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,111
Ready

310
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,303
But it's a thorkell revisionism

311
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,935
Episode that stupid

312
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
But I'm probably not

313
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Insane right

314
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Of 2008

315
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,895
2010 probably did give Obama a chance

316
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
But it's probably such a small

317
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Meaningless population

318
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Compared to

319
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Creamy

320
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
Lynching Effigies and burning them population

321
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Yeah I bet it's kind of

322
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
It's kind of moods

323
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Give that tip of the cow

324
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
TV conservative

325
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Republican party is gone

326
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
Benefit of the doubt

327
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
The blood moon

328
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
I was wondering how you could discover those

329
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,567
If you were born after the year

330
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Z

331
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Negative

332
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Like what

333
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
Well 200 how old is

334
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,039
What are the evolved from multiple sources

335
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,135
Million years ago and they've all kind of

336
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Enter Brad over that time.

337
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
And spread about

338
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Enzo Iowa

339
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
System of

340
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Astronomy

341
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Will probably be

342
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,447
1050

343
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
150000

344
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
Probably

345
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,199
To guide

346
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
No

347
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,319
I thought it was is that what it is

348
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,415
Full moon

349
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
Eclipse will end up looking

350
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
Refracted sunlight

351
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
It seems like that it has nothing to do with that

352
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
It sounds really scary that's our blood moon obviously

353
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
But it's very innocuous space

354
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Phenomenon

355
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
Was

356
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Most likely coin by Mark Bell

357
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
He wrote a book about it after

358
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
Aftermarket already written

359
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,175
Talk about it but what they're describing

360
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Call diluter tetrad

361
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759
EarthSky

362
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
The word is

363
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Describe four successive

364
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Total lunar eclipses

365
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
No partial lunar eclipses

366
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Between

367
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Each of which has separated

368
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
From the other by 6

369
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Lunar moth

370
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
6 full moon

371
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
So

372
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
You understand what that means

373
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
I did are they describing

374
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,775
Is it another like 666 situation here

375
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,847
The numbers do sounds like it might be going that direction

376
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Target

377
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
It's a thing where they are

378
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
Whenever you said six months

379
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
And then I was like

380
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Six months between

381
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:12,255
Time there would have been partial eclipse

382
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
The partial eclipse that falls in

383
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
4

384
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Full lunar eclipse

385
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Right man just happened

386
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
7

387
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Sent the Year One

388
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
T2 times

389
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Next will happen over the years 2030 to 2:20

390
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
What's the lifetime half before this one

391
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
67 +

392
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
68th and before that

393
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
For that was

394
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
2008 built

395
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Notice that the lunar tetrad

396
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
I was coming up with

397
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Jewish holidays

398
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
And began pretty

399
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Second coming of

400
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Jesus was Eminem

401
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,727
In the fall of 2015

402
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
It's a pretty

403
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Yep

404
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
He predicted that in the fall of 2000

405
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
The beginning of the tribulation

406
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
M.

407
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
2015

408
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Jesus's return

409
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
So that I don't like the Jesus return

410
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:14,207
Is simultaneous with a Blood Moon, election

411
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,023
Splash blood moon 2018

412
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
Was the beginning of tribulation

413
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
I don't think he ever fully

414
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
You no make that

415
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Jump at least I haven't heard

416
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
It is interesting

417
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,479
Ideas

418
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
Before that

419
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Weird story

420
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Man

421
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,415
I want to find this episode so bad but I couldn't find it

422
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
I really want to watch this

423
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,767
You predicted that the blood moons were coming

424
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
And

425
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
I wouldn't tell

426
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
So much

427
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
But I'm Jim Bakker so I have to

428
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Few days ago

429
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
I had a man come in my audience and sit right there

430
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,735
And in the middle of the program and we were typing I think

431
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
Several shows that day

432
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Yeah when you started yelling at me

433
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
Cursed me

434
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Did you go to

435
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,328
Is it would be allowed within 20 miles

436
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
Told me I should be stoned to death

437
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
A man who

438
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
Was quoting scripture

439
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
Did he threaten little man that does sound like this is what's crazy

440
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:42,016
Did he threaten to pee in your throat and God hating our president wanted to destroy things and

441
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,576
The church people fighting each other

442
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
He was accusing me is

443
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Accuse me of

444
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
Lying about blood moons

445
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,168
Noah

446
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
I love it I want that episodes

447
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
I know that

448
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Keystone

449
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
Men

450
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
In his defense

451
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
I am almost

452
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
I don't know what

453
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
So

454
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
I assumed at some point you're going to explain

455
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
Why a blood moon

456
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Is so

457
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Important

458
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Because

459
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Blood moon

460
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Question

461
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,224
In the Years 2014 and 2015

462
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Happened

463
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Jewish

464
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Days

465
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
According to Jewish calendar

466
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Calendar

467
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952
It would have fallen on

468
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
It's whatever whatever holidays in September in the one that's in April

469
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Because

470
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Landed on those days

471
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
On the exact

472
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
Yeah but that is actually not that

473
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
The Jewish calendar is based on the moon

474
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
Is a lunar calendar

475
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,504
So the idea that the holidays

476
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,392
Pacific Cycle

477
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
It would be surprising for regularity

478
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:44,640
Guys wrong but

479
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
Now we just get to enjoy him talking

480
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:50,528
Soap in this next clip also

481
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
We've already sort of

482
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,344
That was a couple of

483
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Preliminary objections

484
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Guys.

485
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
They start with a very

486
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
To us

487
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
I'd like to do a preemptive self-defense

488
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
Over the idea that this is Billy

489
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
How were the blood moons of 2014.

490
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,176
Significant what was the significance of them

491
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,760
I know and I'll talk to the rabbi about it too

492
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Great

493
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
And yet you got people who want to stand up and say

494
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,536
What's going on

495
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
What's going on I got enough Warfare without fighting church people

496
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
First off you remember it says it was in the days of Noah

497
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,736
And as it was in the days of lot also be with the coming of the son of man

498
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,600
It says

499
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
Was speaking about

500
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
The

501
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
The destruction coming

502
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
He was as one who mock

503
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,752
So that's almost like a preemptive warning of like you want to be like

504
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
Your own peril

505
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:23,456
Hey

506
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,320
Going to be a disaster

507
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,696
Well I'm going to go ahead and block not necessarily God

508
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
God

509
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
How

510
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,704
Rebuild an unmovable map

511
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
What I don't know how that joke again

512
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,664
Wilmer Valderrama hosts of The Great MTV show

513
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Yo mama

514
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Yoga

515
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
I've tried to add God into it and it didn't go well

516
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,088
Your God is so good

517
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
How

518
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,976
Response

519
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,840
If you start it and then I have to say how fat

520
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,912
I know what comes out today

521
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,544
Not on f****** wild Williams

522
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
Next clip

523
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
Hear what Mark is like a man

524
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Give you a warning

525
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,248
That's all

526
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,136
I mean a lot of people first off

527
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
Was the first to discover the blood moon

528
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:49,216
Guess what the connection is

529
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,712
That's John Hagee

530
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
Did they put the sign Bridges out

531
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
What to say

532
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Calendar

533
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:29,920
Would you be surprised to learn that he's on the show selling a Biblical calendar

534
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,344
Calendar that would almost

535
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
Great work

536
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
Is that

537
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
He doesn't make

538
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Prediction

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
Other books

540
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,864
You know people make those

541
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
What is 7 2018

542
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,680
He predicted that Jesus was

543
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Coming back in the fall

544
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,336
15 and we're in 2017 now so he's obviously got Jesus on his guests

545
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Elation started in 2015 praise God we know we are now safe and have another seven years to get more

546
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Work done for the

547
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:17,024
So that would imply that when he's on Jim Bakker Show in 2017

548
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,400
Figure five more gears 5 more years

549
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
He's on the map

550
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Who is dated 2017

551
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,848
And Mike is this just a repeat from 2015

552
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,896
Cuz why is he talking about all this

553
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Stuff about the blood moon

554
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
2 years ago nothing happened especially when he's already

555
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
Because it's a repeat

556
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
Do the talkin about being president

557
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:49,024
So we have to have been in 2017

558
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
It's very confusing

559
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,656
Like I said he likes to pretend that he never made a specific predict

560
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
About the end times

561
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Blood moon

562
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
Timer 2014 2015

563
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,104
But unfortunately the publication

564
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Show

565
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
Prophecy in the news

566
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:16,160
The news are probably in

567
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:22,816
45-minute drive time on the Dan Ryan

568
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
Jesus is coming in about two weeks.

569
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:33,056
This we're going to see in 2015 on the first day of the first month it again on the 1st

570
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
7th month

571
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Mark biltz

572
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Exactly

573
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
The interviewer

574
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
Which is the Jewish New Year and then

575
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,016
Concludes it is tishri 1

576
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
That concludes the sabbatical year

577
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Felt

578
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Yeah

579
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Interviewer

580
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
Wow

581
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,160
Built yes

582
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Interviewer

583
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,488
It's time for the Messiah to show up right

584
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Built

585
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
Yeah

586
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
This is like a tennis match

587
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,704
It's so excited!

588
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,312
Well that's

589
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Alright

590
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,152
Apple I will not allow any! In trance

591
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,432
Turn on

592
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,200
All caps

593
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
But all caps

594
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Suffice it to say

595
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Make predictions

596
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Soap

597
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Okay so what I don't understand

598
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
Utterly normal phenomena

599
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
That happened

600
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Regularly

601
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
And has happened

602
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:36,288
I would assume since both the Earth and the moon have been in

603
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
62 *

604
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Tetrad

605
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,784
Not what he's talking about them falling on these specific

606
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Jewish feast days

607
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
8 * since 16

608
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
22

609
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
Right which is the first time it's happened

610
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
Jesus's

611
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Apparently

612
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Hey using the exact same information

613
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,168
Uses You could argue the blood moons or just really about bad Blizzard's hitting

614
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Chicago

615
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,520
1967 and 2015 there were two

616
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,848
Ratably bad snowstorm

617
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,272
But then Chicago repented so everything was okay

618
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
We're no Lots over here

619
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
All I can go to Big Lots over here

620
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
It's

621
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
I don't know

622
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
One of the biggest issues

623
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
Did I don't think he ever deals with

624
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,352
Is the fact that

625
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,888
The lunar tetrad

626
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
From 2014

627
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
He's using this based on

628
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
Hebrew calendar it's all about it

629
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
That's what it's all about

630
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,688
The first three of those four eclipses were not visible in Israel

631
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
Which kind of hurts the fear no

632
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
It's like doesn't mean it's not

633
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,464
Signal

634
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,512
About you know how

635
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
Build it during the road

636
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Oh I just like

637
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,008
Three out of every four times

638
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
You make it is invisible part

639
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,368
Bring that want to bring in the supermoon

640
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:36,352
It's because often they douche appear red because they're during the eclipse and refracted light from the sun

641
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
Okay

642
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:43,264
A red eclipses more often in specific

643
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
Generally speaking when you have a full moon that is an Eclipse which is necessary for the lunar tetrad

644
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Partial

645
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,760
Eclipse General you're not going to have

646
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,808
I don't fully understand

647
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
But apparently when it's a full moon and a lunar eclipse

648
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,952
The moon will end up

649
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Okay not always but most of

650
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,096
Vasotec

651
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,704
Like a lot of variables

652
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Yes

653
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,080
Right

654
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,200
Like that kind of time that the moon is red

655
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Have nothing to do with it

656
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah people got to let this whole movement

657
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,880
I don't need anymore anymore like

658
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,072
Because what we're witnessing here on the show

659
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Is just like

660
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
They're behaving like our ancestors

661
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Do you know like way back

662
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,776
That's true ascribing coincidence

663
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
The Moon

664
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
I mean the moon Doug control like

665
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Hides and stuff like that the time

666
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Missouri

667
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
We're like that

668
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,368
Yeah

669
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,720
With my gravitation stuff like that

670
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
I think I don't know

671
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Go.

672
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Could be God's turn was looking for him

673
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
That's possible

674
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
This is all ascribed

675
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Cars 2 Quinn

676
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
You can't really explain

677
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
I trying to make all of these different

678
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,384
Pieces of information match up with

679
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
The dumb Theory

680
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
About

681
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
String of

682
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
Which is an evolutionary Behavior

683
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
Which we've also overcome

684
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,672
A lot of us

685
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
Alarm

686
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,280
A lot a lot of people have lunch

687
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Enough

688
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
To prove

689
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
Possible

690
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
You know we don't have to do this anymore. That the number is far lesser than we thought it was

691
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
Was

692
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,920
Will be back to its

693
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,320
My life's too short to research this I just punted on this one but this sound

694
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Very dumb

695
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Batumi

696
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,512
Just like you're talking about

697
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,376
What I thought was fascinating I saw this in the news the other day you can Google this

698
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
Voted 95% for Trump

699
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:37,088
Interested

700
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
So

701
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,696
That's pretty f***** up that's pretty f***** up

702
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
90

703
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
First of all

704
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,840
Lunar solar eclipse

705
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,264
Percent of the people in the path of the eclipse

706
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
Search it

707
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,128
Cuz I don't know what he's what is that what is that mean

708
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,944
Does that mean that only people who love

709
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,832
God who are repentant I was working at that that coffee distribution

710
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,304
And I remember what happened I looked up at the we all went out and looked at the eclipse

711
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,864
From Chicago

712
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
95% for Trump

713
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
But I mean you might be talking aggregate

714
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
But I don't even believe that

715
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,544
That's impossible

716
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
What polling company that

717
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,920
What polling company was like

718
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,480
Okay we've been doing this whole random sample

719
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,784
We've been doing this whole representative

720
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,392
How we considered the path of the Moon

721
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,952
And they did it and they're like purple

722
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,000
We nailed at 95%

723
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:53,376
Nail in the coffin God Believers or whatever likely

724
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
It was a dumb blog

725
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
And they had no information no more likely something like

726
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
Baton is like well that's obvious

727
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
Jim Bakker

728
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:25,120
He's got to let him say all these crazy s*** on the show recipes never going to move them

729
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,472
You know what

730
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,056
Screwing over people who can't afford to do your dump

731
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
But that's like

732
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:40,992
That's like believing that a free and fair election whines up with 97% of people voting for Putin

733
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:46,368
Like I don't understand how you can even buy that for a second

734
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,464
Do they only count votes

735
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
In the path of the Blood Moon

736
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
I believe it 100%

737
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,984
Also this wasn't the blood moon I don't think cuz the time

738
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,544
This one was like in

739
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
2016

740
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,808
During the blood moon in 2014 and 50

741
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
Are you here before the election

742
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,560
That's a great question

743
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,840
But also

744
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:33,216
No one's doing the reverse switch is the normal pole that's also not asthma

745
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
What are the

746
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,128
People in the audience is going like

747
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
Well that sounds right

748
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,504
I promise you I'm not cherry-picking stuff to make them sound dumb

749
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,344
Legitimately have tried to do my best

750
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,904
Constructivist as like this is

751
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
The things that they're saying

752
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,816
Like I did cut out a bunch of times he's just a list listing off days in the Hebrew calendar cuz it's like

753
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
The Tuesday the 4th of July

754
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:07,520
Early early before like 9 a.m. on a Friday

755
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
That's also a Jewish holiday

756
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
About so

757
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Earlier

758
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Mark

759
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Jared

760
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
He does not make specific predictions

761
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
I can't wait

762
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,136
I want to know what do you think this means it's a strange

763
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:28,768
Well I think it basically

764
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:35,680
Sodom and Gomorrah

765
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,240
How many righteous is needed for America

766
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,624
The Gentiles go by the Sun for their calendar a solar eclipse

767
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
Represents judgment coming upon

768
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,584
Refers to judgement coming upon Israel

769
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
First rebuttal

770
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,912
Israel is a nation

771
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
Solar eclipse

772
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
On Nation

773
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,600
On the lunar eclipses

774
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Israel

775
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,160
Cool

776
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
That you're making this up Mark

777
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
Partial eclipse

778
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,024
Everybody else

779
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
I know that means if we repent a little

780
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,984
It's like a mood ring

781
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
Depending on how eclipse the Moon is he's like oh you guys are brown or partial eclipse

782
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664
Call your mom

783
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,224
Call your mom

784
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,624
Full moon music drunk guy that a good month so drunk you start apologizing

785
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,744
Messenger

786
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
So

787
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
This is baffling to me

788
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
5 time for a few questions

789
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,104
It is

790
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,296
I'm not even address that I reject your privacy alright

791
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
Bravo

792
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,720
Isn't it 2017 when this is

793
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
Is going on

794
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
Can't you just think

795
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,304
For one second like

796
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,656
Oh the Moon is probably not God mood ring they need to sell book

797
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,776
I know I'm not talking about doing there

798
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
And both of them know that this is

799
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Complete Bowl

800
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
Jim Bakker

801
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Probably

802
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,015
But he would be stupid enough to believe it he just doesn't believe anything that anybody tells him anymore because he knows how full of s*** he

803
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,831
I've gotten away with this for so long

804
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,135
Aldi's

805
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Are you almost done

806
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,511
The people in the in the crowd

807
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
None of them

808
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,287
Not one of them just like they don't ever just show one person going like

809
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
Dumb

810
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,199
Some people are just here for the ride

811
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
You know I don't know

812
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,247
That does sound entertain

813
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
We should take

814
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
S*** ton of mushrooms

815
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
And go watch one of these shows

816
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,951
Today will be amazing I wouldn't survive

817
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,511
Absolutely wouldn't survive

818
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
Great radio disaster

819
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Why would you throw some

820
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,215
I'll probably get with him about how he's lying about what

821
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,615
It was me

822
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
You don't even know what

823
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,271
I'll show you a blood moon

824
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
That's that's

825
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,607
Where that was going to end you could have stopped it before

826
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
Lakers

827
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
Explain

828
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Started

829
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
Of 1914

830
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,879
And there was a total solar eclipse over

831
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Eastern Europe

832
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
And the Ottoman Empire

833
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:48,351
And what happened

834
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
It even went over Nineveh

835
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:57,311
Wow it even went over Nineveh so I left the Nineveh in there because he talks about Nineveh a lot

836
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Specifically

837
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
Exactly what Alex

838
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
When the election

839
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
What's happening

840
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
He says that Trump is a

841
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Like Nineveh

842
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
He has given that he is like

843
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,135
He's woke save us necessarily

844
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
But he's given us a reprieve from destruction

845
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
And always says

846
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Like Nineveh

847
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
ESO

848
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
I don't think that that

849
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
Specific is enough for me to argue like

850
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,935
Hey they're getting this from the same place

851
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,263
Weirdo Christian metaphor to me

852
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,079
Jonah in the whale coming out good stuff

853
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,919
Because they agree to go along with stairs

854
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Right

855
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,759
So now the other problem there is that he saying that there was a big

856
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
Eclipse

857
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
It happened right before World War I

858
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Cliff

859
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
14 happened on August

860
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
21st

861
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
20

862
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:55,167
1914 mobilizing against Austria

863
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
Tails

864
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,727
Country declared war on Serbia

865
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,799
Sure Luxembourg on August 2nd

866
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Declared war on France on August 3rd

867
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Declared war on Germany in August

868
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,735
4th April

869
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
17

870
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:14,111
Not matter at all and not match up with you clips of August

871
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
It's because we had our clips

872
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,023
And they were like dude

873
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
Not a good time and a half years wait

874
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
This is your part of the blood

875
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,991
Saying it's some sort of whatever it already broken out

876
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:45,599
Didn't mean anything it's an arbitrary

877
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:51,999
It started in July when you build a road

878
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,607
Cuz you're going to be doing construction ubuildit a ways away from there

879
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
Sometimes you also build it

880
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
Fart

881
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
Road work is done

882
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,799
That way people always on their toes

883
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,943
You got to wait

884
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,039
Until after War has already started I'm listening

885
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:18,111
Can you speak in order to

886
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
Better oats

887
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
This and that analogy

888
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:34,239
At least 25 more times

889
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
Because I am still mad at

890
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
I have stupid

891
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
Cirrhosis

892
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
That I mean that's a problem

893
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
You know just the idea of it like

894
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Already broken out

895
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
You're using this to bolster your your s***

896
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,671
For whatever the dump.

897
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
Bigger pitching about

898
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
Something that didn't

899
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
Prior

900
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,583
I don't understand all this stuff I really

901
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Cheerleader

902
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
Yeah I know I'm furious right now

903
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,031
I don't get why now

904
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,127
Get we deserve something different than 40 days to repent

905
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,735
Then be referencing like a like a

906
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:21,343
Situation like the 40 days and 40 nights is that what he's referencing I mean to flood does come up

907
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
But now I don't even by their own rules

908
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
God would do that

909
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,351
That is a part of it

910
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,239
The rainbow is the Covenant

911
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:44,895
What does a dumb idea I let my I let myself play myself there a little bit I got a little out of control

912
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
Faded

913
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,735
Sorry Bros bros

914
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,295
And I got letter to Paul the Apostle

915
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Dude

916
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,975
I was my bad my bad

917
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,255
Yeah

918
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,327
What you telling is essentially just the Hebrew calendar

919
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,887
That is not a rare thing is it

920
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,215
What does it have like

921
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:17,151
Does it have a good reference

922
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,199
Okay that sounds good

923
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,735
Find anywhere but

924
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Jim

925
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,295
Implies

926
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
We're going to

927
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,415
Have your calendar this week have it right now

928
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
For this coming year

929
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Because

930
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:35,071
I learn more from the Blackhawk the Jewish calendar

931
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
What's the

932
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
The biblical calendar

933
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
Prison I learned so much

934
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,871
You have put one out like I found in prison or not very many around

935
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,663
And you just feel with

936
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Back in the back of the

937
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
Counter there's

938
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
This

939
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,343
Major information about these holidays and holy days

940
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,975
Can find Hubert am when you're not in the joint

941
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,815
I don't get the I know that

942
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,863
Jim likes to say that like the time that he was

943
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,679
Imprisoned

944
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
The Weave that in

945
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Whenever you talk about learning

946
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
When I was in prison

947
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,543
The s*** out of there

948
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
But like

949
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
I don't know much

950
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:25,247
But I do know that generally speaking I don't think he will come out of prison are like

951
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
You know that's crazy

952
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
And let me tell you why

953
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Because

954
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,231
After I believe it was box they had an embedded journalist

955
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
Inside of a d America

956
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
The only thing you said

957
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
1

958
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Lotto

959
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Nazis love Jewish calendar

960
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,943
It was really weird

961
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Lotus ship

962
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,903
Why is it why is it

963
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,999
When I was in prison I learned so much

964
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,815
Why is it more of a red flag for everybody

965
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,143
Do after you get out of prison

966
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Because

967
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,055
The Christian ethos is about

968
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,479
All of the Smiths so much in there they like

969
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:34,879
Yeah I was a monster I was a bad guy on murdered people

970
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
Pull that one off

971
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,463
Cuz you was already a Christian preacher

972
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
But you can

973
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
Pretend that the lesson

974
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,559
You should have learned in prison where learn

975
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,607
My love

976
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Composition

977
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Do that because

978
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Because the Christian

979
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
And it's very much

980
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,823
It's so built in

981
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Brilliant

982
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
And it's one of the reasons

983
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,711
Christianity you are so right for Codman

984
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
It's easy to con Christian

985
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,903
Definitely because the stakes are so implicitly High

986
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,183
Just coming back

987
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,255
The idea of like you could die at any time or you ready

988
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Right

989
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
So things are like

990
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
Very

991
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
F*** with people

992
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Really easy

993
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
Lick that like with f****** blood moon

994
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,847
Absolutely a weird talk of solar eclipses

995
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
The blood moon

996
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Then that

997
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,071
Anyting

998
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,887
Natural in the world that we lack

999
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
Explanation for

1000
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,727
Did you end that comment about

1001
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
Eclipses with an ellipsis

1002
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
No

1003
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
Fassbender's

1004
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:02,687
Natural phenomenon

1005
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,735
Natural phenomena

1006
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,063
You're not going to talk about light okay about

1007
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,903
Watchguard telling you about the white house because it

1008
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
A few days ago there was a

1009
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,047
A rainbow double rainbow over the White House

1010
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,375
A rainbow speaks of God's covenant

1011
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
And over the White House

1012
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,727
I think God is telling America he's in Covenant with us

1013
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,543
Wow

1014
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:35,199
I think God is telling he's a cop.

1015
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,207
Is everywhere is every regular how many rainbows happen

1016
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,279
There's a double

1017
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:57,215
Double rainbow

1018
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
ThunderCats

1019
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:08,479
Houston viral video

1020
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Hate this place

1021
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
You know what

1022
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
Esmad

1023
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:22,047
As I have right now you know why

1024
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:27,679
The intersection of rage and joy for you is really thin like there is a combination of

1025
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:34,079
Alex is except you're actually mad at there's an anchor but it's not as anime

1026
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
Fun

1027
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,319
Manuel Smiler

1028
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:48,159
Alright you may have

1029
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,303
You have far better than most of the therapist I've ever been to a story

1030
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Is it

1031
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,631
I am furious at this

1032
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
Because it is

1033
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
Storm how

1034
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,055
Way less coherent than all the other b*******

1035
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:12,735
I believe Mark Richards is inconsistent bulshit story more than I will by somebody being like

1036
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
The clipse

1037
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Furious is this

1038
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
It's just a

1039
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,439
F****** it's a potion works

1040
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,815
If you were another place it would work differently you are here so it works.

1041
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,983
Dad

1042
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
I can't respond to this

1043
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:42,431
I can't respond to this because of quotes that will come later that'll make this worse

1044
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Look

1045
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
This guy's got a good hot dog

1046
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:52,671
Everything

1047
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Successful

1048
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Yeah man I think you selling

1049
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
10000 books

1050
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,679
I mean is that

1051
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,263
If that's your entire economy

1052
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
He's making more money than us

1053
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:13,663
For sure

1054
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Self-publish

1055
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,991
Only sell 10,000

1056
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
Jim Bakker

1057
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
You consider how much you probably paying

1058
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:29,791
Below market value

1059
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:35,167
Probably $4 a book whatever he's paying you around makes a little more off it

1060
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,495
Accept no more books

1061
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,775
Which was a smart move on his

1062
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:46,687
Double rainbow

1063
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:47,967
Well

1064
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,551
The double rainbow is a sign of God's covenant

1065
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:00,511
Are we talkin about more rainbows album

1066
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
I wish I was

1067
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,655
God wants to be with our White House and we should be praying for our White House

1068
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,191
Instead of cursing it

1069
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,983
America is cursing

1070
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
They're cursing each other

1071
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
They're crushing our president

1072
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
You know what I want

1073
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
When I was in the courthouse

1074
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
They were sentencing me

1075
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,039
To spend the rest of my life

1076
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
In prison

1077
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Another one

1078
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,183
But over that Courthouse

1079
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
What's a rainbow

1080
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
Kahoot

1081
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
All the time that judge was sentencing me

1082
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,007
Read about it

1083
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
Doing the research for my butt

1084
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,871
I was wrong

1085
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Nn

1086
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,759
Announcer person they made fun of me they mock me

1087
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
And so when I saw that

1088
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
That rainbow

1089
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Here's what they did they win

1090
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,791
You don't like them not doing very good

1091
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,911
It's a weird is outer space and something weird you know what I'm saying

1092
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
Market

1093
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:18,847
Tentative

1094
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:25,503
Also never throw his

1095
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:36,255
No tired I don't know no idea

1096
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:46,495
I don't understand why I'm surprising response

00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Yeah

00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567

You're just too dumb to live

1100
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
You're just too dumb to live

1101
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
If you're buying

1102
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,295
Okay

1103
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,343
It's not

1104
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
You believe it then you are you

1105
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,999
You would go off of broken bridge

1106
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:13,119
You have no sense

01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Cover bands are

1140
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:29,567
But I'm not in like a cover band

1141
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,359
Play what does it cover

1142
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
I don't I think there was a lot of

1143
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,223
Jackson covers I don't know I

1144
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
They weren't like I was thinking of a tribute band

1145
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Anything they can play

1146
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,791
This was like a like a wedding reception

1147
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:58,239
Cover band

1148
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:03,615
Contact was like limited to him inviting you to shows where you

1149
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
Nowhere near

1150
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:09,759
Okay

1151
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
I am a musician

1152
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:16,927
I would love if you guys have any segments

1153
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,719
Things like that I could

1154
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:24,351
Record like a little thing for you to send in case you ever wanted to use it like

1155
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,399
We've never

1156
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,983
Considered having segments on account of our Levi nonce

1157
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Rambling

1158
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:38,431
Do you have the out-of-context drop

1159
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,735
Deal as you got.

1160
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903

1161
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,255
Voicemail of the weaker I don't know

1162
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887

And we were trying to figure out a good way to like take advantage of that

1169
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,743
Wanted to

1170
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071

To talk through

The latest

1218
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,271
Televangelist

1219
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,879
We're taking a break from Alex for this episode

1220
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:16,799
Voicemail like oh that's funny I guess

1221
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,527
Alright

1222
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,367
Realize it would do that

1223
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,791
Call and try and leave a message

1224
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
It's kind of a crapshoot

1225
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:44,703
I have no idea have we lost their minds

1226
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,799
Why would anybody

1227
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,359
It's very foreign to our conception

1228
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:57,759
Thank you so much for the call

1229
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,319
Back on track

1230
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Back to blood moon

1231
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
We have Mark

1232
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,439
Have a bombshell

1233
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,487
He's going to drop on

1234
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,279
Jim Bakker gear

1235
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
The clip gym

1236
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
Is it a little bit

1237
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,423
I didn't hold on you want to hear this

1238
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Are you ready

1239
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
What's crazy

1240
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,591
This is insanity almost it's so crazy

1241
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,383
But this is calendar stuff

1242
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
This is what he's trying to teach us

1243
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
Calendar stopped

1244
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
This is a bombshell listen

1245
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,343
If we're talking about calendars

1246
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,647
I don't know if you've ever had a word-of-the-day cow

1247
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:42,303
An advent calendar

1248
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Calendar

1249
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:52,031
I have no idea what I'd Garfield strips

1250
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
This is

1251
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
Ganttic bombshell

1252
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Jim

1253
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
Thanks proves

1254
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,111
Very specific complaint with what they're talking about

1255
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:16,351
It was always held on the second Tuesday of September

1256
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:24,287
That's why it was canceled

1257
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,871
This is all accurate

1258
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,687
This is all true

1259
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487
I didn't know that coincidence

1260
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,959
Because

1261
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
It was supposed to September 21st

1262
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,599
Since 2001

1263
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,415
This is never happened

1264
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
This year September

1265
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,511
Is Rosh Hashanah

1266
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,119
The big one

1267
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
4

1268
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,783
In 2015

1269
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
Partners For Peace

1270
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:21,279
Guess what it is this year

1271
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Peace and safety

1272
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Wow

1273
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,375
Wow

1274
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
That

1275
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,215
What the bombshell

1276
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,263
What is everybody doing

1277
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,359
Why do people

1278
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,199
Then explain to me why people gas

1279
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:45,855
There's a scripture that says the people will call for peace and safety

1280
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,903
Suddenly there'll be destruction

1281
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
It's

1282
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,767
Burst out of I can't remember what book in the Bible

1283
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
They're kind of lying

1284
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,399
For the UN International Day of Peace

1285
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
Quote together

1286
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,447
Disrespect

1287
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Free for all

1288
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
Which is a far cry from

1289
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:10,431
Which words from the actual theme that apply to a scripture that they

1290
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,247
Because it ends with

1291
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,087
I meant Destruction come suddenly

1292
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,183
No it's not it's exactly like

1293
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,815
You divide that says peace

1294
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
Safety

1295
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,447
Get rid of the rest and then you have

1296
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,775
What about that you could just say then that the thing is

1297
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
Together for dignity

1298
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
You could say that

1299
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,575
Probably not I do that God has

1300
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,391
On this one I think this guy's

1301
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,183
Just a lying piece of s***

1302
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Love

1303
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,559
When people are just taking random as numbers in the

1304
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
Is this a what it what is this is this letter Jim Carrey movie the number 1723

1305
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:08,799
In the high holy calendar

1306
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,615
And 4 is the same number as

1307
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,527
And then if you have to that's exactly as many as if there were four twos

1308
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:24,159
Over 84 and that's why I Mexico

1309
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,815
It makes no sense

1310
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,655
The opportunistic ramblings of vague

1311
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
Connections between things

1312
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,311
I withheld one piece of

1313
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Information

1314
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:42,847
That

1315
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,175
Kind of brings into Jim Bakker did 9/11

1316
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
You might have

1317
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
What's a timeline

1318
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
Publishers

1319
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
Mark's butt

1320
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
And and first-come-first-serve

1321
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,327
We sell out of books

1322
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
This thing I'm

1323
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
I hope

1324
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167

System for a lot of Alex Jones guests or WorldNetDaily

Folks like Joseph Farah

1334
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:39,935
Who runs world who actually I co-wrote Mark's first book

1335
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,215
Blood moon

1336
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
From 2008

1337
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:50,175
There's a real fur connect well

1338
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
Do Dwell

1339
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
He is

1340
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,599
Frequently published on WorldNetDaily as well they put out a bunch of articles

1341
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,415
Blood moon

1342
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,815
Theory

1343
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
Completely separate world

1344
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:15,007
And yet more simple

1345
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
What convention

1346
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:23,199
Situation

1347
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
Ex-con

1348
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,831
Print contacts

1349
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,159
Did the queen know that Alec

1350
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,743
Rodger Stone Mountain 2013

1351
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,559
Right so we know that

1352
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,631
You know the Kerry Cassidy

1353
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
You've met a bunch of

1354
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,447
These people that she talks to

1355
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,287
Convention

1356
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,639
They make their connect

1357
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,967
They're so obviously yes a lot of these people

1358
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Similar circles

1359
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
It's

1360
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,783
They don't like the cause

1361
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Play

1362
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
Yeah that's

1363
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,903
Images

1364
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,511
I want I want to know that might be Jim Bakker

1365
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,071
Probably fuked Kelly Jones

1366
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
Okay

1367
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,215
Whatever

1368
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
I'll buy it

1369
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
For a dollar

1370
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
From what

1371
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Jim Bakker

1372
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,151
I bet

1373
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,223
You think so

1374
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,271
He learned a lot in prison

1375
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
Carries himself

1376
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,111
I feel like

1377
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:34,879
He is

1378
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
Daughtering

1379
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
No Iraq

1380
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,255
You don't like I know that that seems weird

1381
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,559
Put on

1382
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,119
But I watched enough of his show and the way he's

1383
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:45,887
Mumbling

1384
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
Through words

1385
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,447
I just

1386
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
Who's the guy

1387
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,007
Knows how to turn it on

1388
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
But I don't think

1389
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:57,151
I don't think this is a guy who that's why we got drugged and

1390
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
Kids are adults

1391
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
Whatever

1392
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,791
Propagandas for his buddy

1393
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
You get

1394
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,679
A lot of food

1395
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,543
A bunch of unsold books hanging out in Lori's house

1396
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:29,663
So this next clip I think is one of the most ironic things I've ever heard

1397
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Is this is

1398
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
Is weird

1399
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
False prophets in the world

1400
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:38,623
Call Mike

1401
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,095
To hear that

1402
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,375
Clear that at the end

1403
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,215
It looks like you're having a lot of

1404
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,775
This is a lot of money

1405
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:03,199
This is a lot of manipulative

1406
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
God

1407
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:17,791
God dammit that's the equivalent of like people in the Infowars world

1408
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Accusing other people

1409
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,239
Earlier

1410
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
About this

1411
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
Just like

1412
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,311
Branding

1413
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Eclipses as

1414
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,359
Meaning some

1415
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
Which is weird because

1416
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
Using like the eclipse

1417
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
14

1418
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:40,063
Is being like

1419
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Going to start

1420
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:41,855
Right

1421
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,391
But his big

1422
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Foundational thesis

1423
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,695
Is just about the

1424
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,975
Blood moon

1425
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
It's fall on Jewish holiday

1426
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
I'm so

1427
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
He gets into this

1428
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Next clip mark.

1429
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,375
And it makes me

1430
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
Even more

1431
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,191
He was like he's really.

1432
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
A lot

1433
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
There's a possibility

1434
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,087
Eclipses

1435
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:19,999
Which is how long the Earth

1436
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:25,119
According to his calendar

1437
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,239
Amazon

1438
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,223
Eclipse that goes over a nation

1439
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,647
What what

1440
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:54,815
Why is this position supposed to carry weight I don't get it

1441
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,655
Even undercut his own argument by saying that

1442
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,495
If it doesn't occur

1443
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,311
Then it's fine because it is a feast

1444
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,687
God is creating a piece.

1445
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
So why would it matter if it occurred on a

1446
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
Determined

1447
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Disagree

1448
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:22,207
Does Great Clips has happened it's not God

1449
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
The calendar that you

1450
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
Conveniently

1451
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Every voice

1452
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,311
To which I would respond what a way what are the other ones I've got doing the exact same thing a bunch of times but

1453
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Stop

1454
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
Giving his opinions about reality tea

1455
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
Maybe you're something like that words like

1456
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:49,087
Meaningful conversation it's just God trying to vent some s***

1457
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:55,487
When is Cliff's goes over like the Arctic Circle or whatever

1458
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
That just

1459
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:02,655
Fleurette on the mind

1460
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
It's mind-boggling

1461
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:08,031
Blood

1462
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,823
Play plasma

1463
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,615
Anthem

1464
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,943
They put on the great name for a

1465
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,991
Blood Moon Blood Moon

1466
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,391
Mark my other complaints

1467
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,671
Change the name to platinum

1468
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,255
Please just whatever and you can't

1469
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
Channel Time

1470
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
You think that's

1471
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,679
Awful

1472
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
I was watching it

1473
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Hey I got to think

1474
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
Bugasalt

1475
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,567
Look at Salisbury

1476
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,359
Yeah but at the same time

1477
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
Who are these people

1478
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,943
Right I think they're actor

1479
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
The people who were guests

1480
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,503
At least they're Faking It

1481
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
In order for sensational

1482
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,343
Like there aren't enough people that they

1483
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:59,743
This very specific problem like I want you to do a lie detector test to prove that you're not sucking my cousin

1484
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,583
You know or whatever did not you're not going to be able to make that show once a month

1485
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,863
With

1486
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,447
Adorable sampling of people

1487
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,239
Hamming it up and stuff like that

1488
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,519
At the same time

1489
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,567
Some of them are

1490
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
Amazing actors

1491
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,432
You know

1492
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Command

1493
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
Eat cuz I don't believe it's real

1494
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,808
And that means that these people are

1495
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Incredible actor

1496
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,136
Which I think should be a pool

1497
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,672
Fur like casting movies

1498
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,256
I disagree

1499
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:43,520
The camera follows them

1500
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,568
And I think maybe they could

1501
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:50,176
Play the flip side isn't

1502
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,712
Beaker dystopia

1503
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,016
Except

1504
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,856
I think we have to accept that their problems are possibly real

1505
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
And then worse

1506
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,696
The audience is treating them that way

1507
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
The audience

1508
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,560
Yelling at them and be like Boo

1509
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Stuff like that

1510
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
If they're not all

1511
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,752
Everyone needs therapy

1512
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
And therefore I believe it's

1513
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
And lost

1514
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,224
This has been my

1515
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,624
We're going to take my music

1516
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:43,936
I will I will take the recording to the board and we will decide whether or not you

1517
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,264
Sienna why everybody who watches

1518
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,384
This is what happens I'm an advocate

1519
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,456
What are we even talking

1520
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
This is insane

1521
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Eclipse

1522
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
A lot

1523
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,184
And they don't always mean something something

1524
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
And you should be aware when they mean

1525
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,792
And by virtue of them sometimes meaning something

1526
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:16,192
You can obviously discount the fact that they happen all the time because of course they don't always mean something sometimes

1527
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
That makes sense

1528
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,592
Yeah that's a perfectly logical statement that a lot of people only believe

1529
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:26,176
I would say that's an unfair thing for something for someone

1530
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,480
Just because

1531
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,272
Before we started the clip that makes it more

1532
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
Utterly baffled especially when he's

1533
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:40,256
Already on the show talking about various eclipses that have happened over the time

1534
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
The feast days

1535
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
About

1536
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,168
You know what this might as well be saying

1537
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,264
Legitimately might as well be him being like

1538
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,080
Well everytime I burp

1539
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
Yeah

1540
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:59,712
Not every time a bird poops on you good luck

1541
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
But sometimes good luck

1542
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Which means that

1543
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:09,952
Virtbiz lucky

1544
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,512
Sometimes

1545
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,816
Even more like slightly nefarious

1546
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,376
Because it also relies on a schedule

1547
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
That is very specific

1548
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:25,056
Weekly lunar base

1549
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:29,152
Pacific schedule.msu side if they poop on you on these days

1550
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
It's even more

1551
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,016
Failing to

1552
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:37,600
Explain to people how lunar calendars work

1553
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,464
They did

1554
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,280
Did you know that I did know that

1555
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
Cyndi Lauper

1556
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,864
Cyndi Lauper never had a chance

1557
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,704
I thought she was murdered

1558
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,752
River couple more Clips year left

1559
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,544
To go through I don't think we found any

1560
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,408
Questions other than there than just

1561
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,176
I-88

1562
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:07,296
What is out of hand it's so stupid what do you what do you even respond to this with other than just like

1563
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,696
Responded what I said

1564
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
The first 20 minutes

1565
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
Episode

1566
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:23,168
Hebrew calendar is based on the lunar calendar exhaust there already

1567
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,752
Phenomenon

1568
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,776
High holy days

1569
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
What a shock

1570
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,872
SpongeBob dates here

1571
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,664
For a bit

1572
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,944
You saying it really is

1573
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,016
Meaningless as you just give a long list of

1574
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,064
August 4th

1575
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,136
Let's go

1576
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,160
How about

1577
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
May

1578
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,256
How do you feel about that

1579
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,280
Good day good day

01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:52,096
Good day as well be doing that

1581

To serve

1582
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
Prelude to what comes after

1583
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,360
That was on the calendar

1584
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
That's the 17th

1585
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,768
100 years

1586
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:25,376
Anniversary

1587
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:29,216
You got the 50th anniversary of the unification of Jerusalem

1588
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,336
This year

1589
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
Wow

1590
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,712
Everybody I want to see this

1591
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,552
The phone gets so busy at the end of the show

1592
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,088
If you want

1593
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,928
I want everybody to order a calendar

1594
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,232
See

1595
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:56,864
Softest add pivots number

1596
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:01,216
Yeah and that's why I think

1597
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
Yeah

1598
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
Mumbly add laptop

1599
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800

Get real busy at the end of the show

1601
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,944
Departed book

1602
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
From the sky

1603
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,064
The things or take a book plus a food bucket

1604
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,368
He's gotta move those books is that he had allowed

1605
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
What is it with

1606
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
Loving

1607
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
Round

1608
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Except

1609
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,304
The same time

1610
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
Random event

1611
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
That occurs sometimes

1612
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,400
Are also

1613
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,680
Bailiwick

1614
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
And then

1615
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,752
Also but like

1616
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:36,032
On anniversary

1617
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,872
Play I got a big 10 system

1618
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:47,296
Hey there is it just God does not have like a

1619
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:52,416
Like like this user numerology kind of system as well like

1620
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
He's like okay first off

1621
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:59,072
Blood moon happens over 2000 years

1622
01:26:59,328 --> 01:26:59,840
No big deal

1623
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
Right

1624
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Yeah yeah

1625
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Cuz he doesn't

1626
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,288
Like been caught into this b*******

1627
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,872
It doesn't happen like every 60

1628
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,432
Years it's not like a round number

1629
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,736
Right now but it is important

1630
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,552
Hundreds of years go by sometimes where there are

1631
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Like

1632
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,648
Here we have two that are 15 years apart

1633
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,208
So so like we got that

1634
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,536
Anniversary

1635
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:35,680
This is like 50 years since mind 70 years since Israel became a state in all of this stuff

1636
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Does

1637
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,384
Figure his s*** out for a little bit that's all

1638
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,944
And their belief in a god that is

1639
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:55,392
Bring the 50 and 70 year anniversary isn't that smart

1640
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,720
Defender

1641
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,560
If you are going off of the Jewish calendar

1642
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,912
Then it's not exactly 50 years

1643
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,192
It's not the

1644
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
You're using

1645
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,336
Bye-bye couch at least

1646
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,640
Different calendars

1647
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:22,272
Well the same time asserting that certain anniversaries on one calendar make sense

1648
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,088
Well the same time in other calendar as

1649
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,696
This doesn't make a goddamn benefit but if you buy a calendar will

1650
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,024
The combines all of them into one

1651
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Dammit

1652
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,936
So this next up I think is probably the most

1653
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,704
Troubling

1654
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
Peace

1655
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
No there's a lot of people talking about

1656
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,896
There's so many trumps in the Bible

1657
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,480
They thought maybe President Trump might be one of them the last one

1658
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,320
I don't know

1659
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:00,160
Feel like the audience

1660
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,976
Applauding the idea that Trump is the last trumpet

1661
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,256
And then revelation

1662
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
Really

1663
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:10,400
Because it implies a real self-destructiveness on the part of Their audience

1664
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
Fill the message

1665
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
To be sent is

1666
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
Let's get toward this

1667
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,664
Like it's not good

1668
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
For someone

1669
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:25,248
Whose entire business model is about selling you things

1670
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,528
To prepare for the end times

1671
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,320
To really want them to

1672
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,088
Succumb

1673
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,648
Cuz you got it from both

1674
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,208
You know like you got to assume.

1675
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Manipulating you with his rhetoric

1676
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,024
In order to get

1677
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,048
To buy the thing

1678
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,800
It would be like people who sold

1679
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,336
Security systems

1680
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
Arash rahbar

1681
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,200
It's the same sort of like thick

1682
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
I get

1683
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,040
You should not say those things

1684
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:03,648
You know like if you are in that business maybe you are pulling for robberies to happen

1685
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,208
Publicly

1686
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,232
He was a business person

1687
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:11,072
You are shady as hell I'm not going to do business with you

1688
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
Boss comes to mind

1689
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,704
Whatever

1690
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:23,616
Torture killer killer killer

1691
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,920
The guy who

1692
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,224
Works for a security company

1693
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,808
Enzo's new how to break it

1694
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
People who

1695
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,392
God everybody stupid

1696
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,096
I only keep this in because Mark ends up

1697
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:44,864
Prediction

1698
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,728
Peace and safety

1699
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,288
Destruction

1700
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
The end of the September

1701
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,128
We don't know

1702
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,688
It's a sign

1703
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,480
We ought to read it

1704
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
What is it say

1705
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,552
It says

1706
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,600
Who invented

1707
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:08,416
Who is this

1708
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,488
They are saying peace and safety

1709
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,512
My God

1710
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,912
13

1711
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:22,496
This makes me still can get about her

1712
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,568
Destructions coming

1713
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,848
So that's the scripture

1714
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
You can get excited about that

1715
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
Because you knows

1716
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
It's not that's not

1717
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
Indicative of Bonner that's indicative of like

1718
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,856
This is how we're going to move the books

1719
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
He's old

1720
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,840
Just Dance

1721
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:48,864
I can get more food

1722
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,424
What age

1723
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,216
What a bowl-shaped cop-out to

1724
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,032
Anytime somebody says peace and safety

1725
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
Distraction is

1726
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,616
That is such a

1727
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,248
The un's

1728
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
Be the UN

1729
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
The Bible

1730
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,088
I was predicting

1731
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
The actual

1732
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
You're so sweet

1733
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,232
Stupid

1734
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
Even if they said

1735
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,584
Right they did they did

1736
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,448
I took that mean that used a lot more ultimately what they say

1737
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Destruction

1738
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Is Eminem

1739
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
And Market in here saying

1740
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,848
You know that mean probably by the end of

1741
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
September

1742
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,432
This could all go down

1743
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,504
No one

1744
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Has ever said

1745
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,832
Timer

1746
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,368
Up until this point

1747
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,672
This was preordained by God

1748
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:48,000
In the intervening time. Of when when was what

1749
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,048
What book was the

1750
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,352
Okay so let's say

1751
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
At the label

1752
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:57,984
At the latest date was like Revelation error select call it like 400

1753
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,776
Something like this

1754
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
Sobor

1755
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,848
1600 years

1756
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
Nope

1757
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,272
Do you wind it okay will do

1758
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,320
Destruction is imminent

1759
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
And you know what that

1760
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,696
Guess what

1761
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
Totally cool

1762
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,792
Here's why

1763
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,632
Why am I prepared

1764
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,424
If you came to my house

1765
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,728
Wrightwood United you down to my baby

1766
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,288
You would see enough food for

1767
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,128
13 years 14 years Broadway I don't know

1768
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,176
And why would I

1769
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
You're crazy

1770
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,320
I went to prison

1771
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:51,232
I wish you would have stopped there I wish you could stop

1772
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:57,120
I wish I could give you the food in prison

1773
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Also

1774
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:04,288
Go to like a white-collar prison prison was an infinitely better than its 13 years old

1775
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:08,128
Again it Bears mentioning with

1776
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,432
Lyndon larouche in prison

1777
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,480
So much time

1778
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,552
In this book called the whole

1779
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,880
Then I became a fanatic

1780
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,464
I believe it

1781
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:26,048
I believe the date of Believe the time to bring the hour

1782
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,656
Do you believe in life after love read it all is going to start harmonizing

1783
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,776
I found the answer

1784
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
In the Bible

1785
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,872
To the revelation

1786
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,176
Do with four people

1787
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
In the last days

1788
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
And here

1789
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,528
The United Nations

1790
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,064
This year

1791
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:50,112
Announce the date

1792
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,928
September 21st

1793
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,720
Is the day

1794
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
A piece

1795
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
And safety

1796
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
To the world

1797
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Mute

1798
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
He was wanting

1799
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,472
He was wanting that to get to like a

1800
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,544
Selling books

1801
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
Instead it died like a

1802
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:15,968
Soft fart and then he immediately gets interrupted by one of his other co-host I've no idea who he is

1803
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,760
What do we do

1804
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:22,624
Which actually is probably another attempt

1805
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:29,024
Cracker Barrel

1806
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,072
The guy is just like

1807
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,888
Mark Rambo the whole bunch

1808
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,168
About Tavares

1809
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:39,776
Stupid crazy stupid so I mean at the end of this

1810
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:41,824
I feel like there might

1811
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,104
Still be a little bit of

1812
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Fusion

1813
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:50,528
I'm looking at this and I'm like I know exactly there might be a little bit of confusion I don't know what

1814
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:55,136
Anyone here has said or is trying to say I want to try in at least

1815
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,416
At the end of the

1816
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,952
Answer any questions

1817
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
You as the audience surrogate

1818
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,888
Confused I can sit here as the person who did all the research

1819
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:12,288
Well this is a game we've never played

1820
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,824
Final question

1821
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,432
Anything you need to clear it up

1822
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
Okay well

1823
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,016
None of us need to ask the question why

1824
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
Cuz we all know why

1825
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:25,344
Why is seltzer

1826
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,672
Keep Trump

1827
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,720
President or whatever it is right

1828
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:38,400
They think they're going to get a theocracy out of it

1829
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,168
Tongues are like

1830
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:42,240
Going to work much better

1831
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,800
My question

1832
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
First off

1833
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,872
Material

1834
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,432
What is there evidence of

1835
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,224
So

1836
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016
Thursday's Moon

1837
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,576
Right there's the lunar tetrads

1838
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,160
Two years prior

1839
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Episode

1840
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,208
Okay

1841
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
You know what

1842
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,512
You've actually

1843
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:09,376
You asked the most basic question into one I can

1844
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,728
Because I

1845
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,800
I looked like two and a half hours

1846
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,360
And I don't understand why

1847
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,664
He's applying these predictions

1848
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
The 2017

1849
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
When all these Blood Moons happened to 2014 2015

1850
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,160
The fact that the UN named their day of peace

1851
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,024
More mileage out of that than you need

1852
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,424
2 stars or anything like that right

1853
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:49,568
In the middle

1854
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
I don't

1855
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,432
Yeah I mean

1856
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,712
Brewster's just

1857
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,016
The random occurrences of

1858
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
Does eclipses

1859
01:37:59,296 --> 01:37:59,808
Yeah

1860
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:02,624
And I'm trying to cheat and make them fit your

1861
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
Pattern

1862
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,160
Right

1863
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
So there's that

1864
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
Okay how about

1865
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:13,632
But just go with if we're going to go with God is super into

1866
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Astronomy

1867
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:22,592
Actually that's my next question. I think you might be doing the wrong kind of question

1868
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:28,992
Questions that are like

1869
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,832
I realize exactly what I was doing immediately after apologizing

1870
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:37,696
Is

1871
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,768
So ostensibly this guy

1872
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,584
Discovered blood

1873
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
Snow

1874
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,400
He named them blood

1875
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:52,800
Already existed in the astrology of course.

1876
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,360
This guy

1877
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Who

1878
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:58,688
Has to have at least some level

1879
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,224
Astronomy

1880
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,248
Knowledge

1881
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,016
Right

1882
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:09,952
Just as far as a basic like I'm not whether or not

1883
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:13,792
Put it out right 2008

1884
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:17,376
Could this one is first book came out

1885
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:19,168
So this is all post

1886
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,704
2008

1887
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,824
Yeah I thought this guy come in like the 70s or something

1888
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,200
This started as best I can tell probably 2007

1889
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,784
The book that would be released in 2018

1890
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,576
When he predicted the Jesus Christ

1891
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,344
To come back in 20

1892
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
This dude

1893
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,464
Starts researching

1894
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:46,048
Why did he's why does he start

1895
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,144
I mean

1896
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,936
Alright

1897
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,728
Nobody

1898
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
My question

1899
01:39:55,008 --> 01:40:01,152
Rhetorically is appropriate

1900
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,688
You have a very clear reason

1901
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,992
It was all so Random

1902
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:10,624
Like I wasn't typing kind of a watershed moment in history is not end of reaction to it is not

1903
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,184
Call Nick

1904
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,768
Look like I was doing before

1905
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,864
Following an incident with him like sitting around

1906
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:23,680
Stoned looking at pictures

1907
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
That one's really red

1908
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:32,384
Or whatever you know there's probably something like that we don't know about I just don't understand why

1909
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:38,784
Stupid question questions stupid

1910
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:43,904
Do this

1911
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,000
Fully accept that and I you are correct except

1912
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:52,864
Criticism of that question and I believe it is also correct I think enough people go about their lives

1913
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,680
To like learn about weird stuff

1914
01:40:55,936 --> 01:41:02,080
Let's Wikipedia.

1915
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,664
YouTube videos something like that and then you find some like

1916
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,456
Weird thing then you get deeper

1917
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:11,552
That whole you start to find coincidences that you decide to ascribe meaning

1918
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
And then it blossoms into a book

1919
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,160
You're right with the founder of my world

1920
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,464
God dammit

1921
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
Stupid

1922
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:22,304
Yeah it's it's probably more I mean like I think

1923
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,608
Well I can't answer that question

1924
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,168
Definitive way I can answer it

1925
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,472
He probably just stumbled onto something.

1926
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,568
Then it seems to have clearly

1927
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,104
Spiraled into something

1928
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:41,504
Because he has all of these bulshit day it works really well he has all of these

1929
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,784
Bulshit dates where he's like

1930
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,088
Oh well I have this Blood Moon

1931
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
Siri

1932
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,952
Now I'm just going to learn about

1933
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,280
Klipsch is too because World War

1934
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,608
What is this

1935
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,400
He is f******

1936
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
Banking

1937
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,448
On Surviving

1938
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,032
Until 2032 when the next tetrad comes around

1939
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:09,664
I will put them in 50 that's it'll be around

1940
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,712
2030 talking about

1941
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:14,016
It's all good

1942
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:20,672
Let's circumstances California is on fire

1943
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,696
Right now

1944
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,720
It's not bad

1945
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,608
La Tanya's lamp.

1946
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:31,424
I get all that

1947
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,824
Let's stipulate to climate change isn't going to kill us all

1948
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,848
Cuz he probably believes

1949
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:39,616
The hoax

1950
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
So in his mind

1951
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,944
Praying that he makes

1952
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,968
623

1953
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,736
Because then

1954
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
You get to do this

1955
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,040
Game all over again

1956
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,600
Wright's retirement money

1957
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,696
He gets to retire on that 2032 blood moon

1958
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,256
Also said like you should be able to

1959
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,608
650i nobody

1960
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,400
Oh no

1961
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Whatever

1962
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,752
He's not doing a good job shift work

1963
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,336
He's not working

1964
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:13,664
World

1965
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,968
Floating b******* theories

1966
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:21,600
Are you want to retire before 70 you that's all

1967
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:26,720
This is a weird demarcation of organized labor that I don't understand

1968
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,048
I don't think there's a union for liars

1969
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:35,168
No look there's there's spiders

1970
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:41,568
Skyrim

1971
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,152
Stop talking about it when I was great

1972
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:49,760
You got to get in a great storyline

1973
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,552
Gil was a great story

1974
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
What ambassador

1975
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Okay

1976
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,648
I love Skyrim

1977
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,440
I thought it was amazing

1978
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,744
The world is very open

1979
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,864
Questions about

1980
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,912
I loved it

1981
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:11,776
It's not my kind of game you mad at me whenever you did find out

1982
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,056
The hell out of it

1983
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
I like

1984
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
Exploring around

1985
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,896
Yeah but it is certain

1986
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,176
Point

1987
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,248
Vulcanus of the largest

1988
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Love the game

1989
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,808
Nostalgic kind of

1990
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Clear to me

1991
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,136
I can I can never Play It Again

1992
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,672
I can't go back to

1993
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:29,440
Enjoy it

1994
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,720
Cuz I know that like

1995
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,488
Aldi's

1996
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,560
Essentially

1997
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,328
Nothing

1998
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,888
You know like the Thieves Guild

1999
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
Dickhole

2000
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,240
Non-playable characters hanging out

2001
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
I love chat

2002
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:44,800
Bulshit

2003
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,872
I want the game to the internet

2004
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,992
I was hoping you would realize that you're crazy

2005
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:55,808
That was the expectation

2006
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,368
But I think the game built

2007
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,696
The experience

2008
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,976
Who's playing

2009
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,792
Apple Maps

2010
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,352
Like

2011
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,888
It implies that

2012
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,168
Vicious

2013
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
Keep going

2014
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
You know what's

2015
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:17,824
You know it's crazy but there are a lot of people

2016
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,360
Who felt that way about Skyrim

2017
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:21,664
Rational

2018
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,200
Do you know what they did

2019
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
What's that they made more of it

2020
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,784
Weather like

2021
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,320
Made like a

2022
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,136
They mate

2023
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,952
Where is Starbucks

2024
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
Now I will tell you this right now

2025
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:38,304
Your dream of an infinite Skyrim

2026
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,608
It's real

2027
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:46,496
Because so many people felt the way you did they felt that promise of an infinite World where they can just

2028
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:52,896
Exist and they can live forever and not ever

2029
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:57,248
There is an infinite number of Mazda you can add to Skyrim

2030
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,016
People are

2031
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,808
Still making Skyrim

2032
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:05,184
Putting f****** I can't remember the name of that

2033
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,720
Oblivion

2034
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:10,816
Enter the Skyrim growing more and more content in Skyrim

2035
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,840
All the time

2036
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,144
There's a rich community

2037
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,984
I can't cuz I have it on the switch I've no idea how to plug in

2038
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,360
This brings us to the end of our Jim Bakker

2039
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,640
Exploration

2040
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
Anna Skyrim

2041
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Until our next step

2042
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,784
Figure out how to mod

2043
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,768
What what would you like to still mate

2044
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,584
You've learned I know that I've already asked

2045
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,864
Dude ask question

2046
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,936
What I've learned

2047
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,728
No

2048
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:56,128
What is wildly unsatisfied with this episode

2049
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,920
Episode

2050
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,736
Like I did not leave

2051
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,760
Things out

2052
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
Lineup

2053
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,856
It makes it makes it like I didn't know I'd be like

2054
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:13,792
In some clip from his episode that I didn't play or anything like that

2055
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,376
Jesus

2056
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,912
Maybe this is just all crazy

2057
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,472
It's not like there is

2058
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,008
There is no way

2059
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,056
Explanation

2060
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:27,872
Myself into the mind of The Listener who probably is like

2061
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:30,176
Mcwethys like Wyatt

2062
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
What were the

2063
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,992
These people talking about that they're covering

2064
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,296
And it makes me feel like we

2065
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
I don't know what makes me feel like

2066
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,648
Don't let me let me let me get

2067
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
Even further to the heart of the question

2068
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,488
I don't know

2069
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,024
How there could be

2070
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,072
That you left

2071
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,912
Is incoherent nonsense

2072
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:58,592
This happens if this happens literally every time we play Jim Bakker episode where I'm like

2073
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,408
I don't believe in God

2074
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,968
I don't believe in any of this

2075
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:04,736
I think it's

2076
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,112
My childhood self

2077
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:12,928
Is offended on behalf of the Bible

2078
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,768
I hope God exists to punish this

2079
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,376
This is why the rules set down by the

2080
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
Incoherent nonsense

2081
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,936
At the church

2082
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,216
And and

2083
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,264
Double down on that

2084
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,104
Whether you listen to the entire Jim Bakker episode

2085
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,944
But we cover

2086
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:41,344
There's no we making updates and then ascribing eclipse

2087
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,368
What are you talkin about

2088
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,904
Just my own it's

2089
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,744
There's no way there's no way to make this make sense

2090
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
Unless

2091
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,048
Literally everything

2092
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,328
Any scientist

2093
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
Has ever learned

2094
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,656
Is

2095
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:58,240
But this this to me seems like science in the

2096
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,008
1700

2097
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,360
Well that's like what I was saying is like what they're doing is our ancestors

2098
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,176
Yeah they're being like

2099
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:11,040
This is Elder stuff

2100
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:14,624
Yeah

2101
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,256
It's not

2102
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:24,608
It's good

2103
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:31,008
It's just random ass like oh and by the way also because women there's

2104
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:33,568
Recycles are based around the Moon in

2105
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,616
Women can't be allowed to have off

2106
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:41,504
Like whatever bulshit that this is

2107
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,320
Old Testament rules about having her.

2108
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:48,672
Yeah but

2109
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
Yeah but

2110
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,256
I didn't I don't

2111
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,560
I don't think he was saying that it

2112
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:59,680
But he was saying that like the amount of days match up with some sort of

2113
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:02,496
It was nonsense but it was again about like weird man

2114
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,776
It wasn't about

2115
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,312
Put the woman in the sweatshirt

2116
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
Alright

2117
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
Whatever

2118
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
Whatever

2119
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
Exactly

2120
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,992
No no

2121
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:13,760
No

2122
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,552
Here's my summation of this up

2123
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:19,392
So whatever Jim Bakker is

2124
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,160
App

2125
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,696
Congratulation

2126
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:22,464
Tumi

2127
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
Because

2128
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,280
Thai chili plant

2129
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,352
Justice

2131
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:44,480
No it's really good I'm not going to eat a pepper

2132
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,528
No we're not going to do that I got to

2133
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,808
Alright we might do that tomorrow

2134
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:52,672
No we're not love it

2135
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,696
God I hate you

2136
01:50:54,720 --> 01:51:00,864
It's like a habanero or something it's not that hot

2137
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:04,448

Marketing sales people and then be like
