Alex Jones  00:04
Red Alert. Red alert. Red alert. Red alert. Knowledge. Damn, Jordan, I'm sweating. Knowledge party.com It's time to pray. I have great respect for knowledge like knowledge. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys. Xiang Ji or the bad guy knowledge. Dan and Jordan knowledge fight need money Andy and Sandy are stopping Andy and Pam handy in Kansas. Andy in Kansas, you're on the airplane. Huge fan. I love your word. Knowledge by now, knowledge fight.com

Dan  00:59
Hey, everybody, welcome to knowledge, right. I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're couple dudes sit around, worship at the altar of sleep and talk a little bit about Alex Jones. Oh, indeed. My voice sounded weird. There. That's why I was kind of like, lost. Yeah, for a second. So

Jordan  01:11
I guess you're doing great. All right. You didn't sound weird to me. Okay. Hey, come on. Keep it going. Okay. All right. Hey, what is your bright spot?

Dan  01:23
My bright spot today Jordan is with a with a resounding capital letter is Magic cards. I got some capital letters

Jordan  01:32
for brightspot. Yes, magic color gathering card capitals all across the board.

Dan  01:38
I opened the gate with trying out the magic arena online. It was fun. I like the art style of a lot of these cards. I like the game play. I enjoy that. But it wasn't really exactly what I was looking for. And so I got on eBay and just got a big box of random cards. And that was what I was looking for. Yes, it's there's a tactile sensation to it. And they looking at there's a there's a there's a as I was telling you before we started recording, there's almost like an implied story. Yeah, in all of it. That's, that's just it's gripping and atmospheric and calming. I really, really, really enjoy it. And I wish that I had been able to mess around with these things when I was 13. Yeah,

Jordan  02:20
I understand. It's that same feeling that like, you would never go to a bookstore, a bookstore that's just filled with eBooks, you know, like you go to a used bookstore with stacks of books that are unorganized. And you can smell the paper and you can touch it with your fingers. And it's a completely different extreme. We're

Dan  02:38
getting dangerously close to talking about the warmth of vinyl.

Jordan  02:41
No, we're not. It's just things were Oh, we are old.

Dan  02:46
But so I was considering checking some of these cards out and actually what pushed me over the edge and made me like yeah, definitely for sure. Was that Jason sent us something to the mailbox. Yeah. And that was to individually crafted magic cards and saying, based on Alex Jones, we'll put up a picture of them. But one one is sudden plug. And the other is over prepare so good are so awesome. They're amazing. And these are just sort of one of a kind things and I was like well, why not build a collection around this? Of course. So I'm starting down that road, I'm gonna not go too crazy. But Jason, in his notes that he sent along with it. Also, he requested that we give a shout out to his uncle Kurt. And I say fuck that. No, I'm gonna give a shout out to both of you. Whoo, boy, shout out to Jason shout out.

Jordan  03:41
I don't know, I'm feeling a lot of aggressive energy coming from all directions. He's telling me I have to do something. You're telling me that I have to do something different. I'm just gonna say you can you can sit out of this one. I'm given both. I'm taking both shoutouts away. We're gonna even this out. We're gonna equal it out. And I've given two shout outs each. Now we're in an evolutionary arms race. There's

Dan  04:02
no way around this. Also piggybacking on some of this stuff, too, I want to give a special shout out to Dylan Kay, who got in touch with me and I was way too delayed in sending an email back about an idea for a card game. The sort of along these lines and Lucas Ah, thank you so much. Put that battle hardened goblin yes card. Twitter that started a little bit of a thread Yeah, Info Wars personalities as magic cards.

Jordan  04:29
It's fantastic.

Dan  04:31

I'm excited. I'm excited to go.

Dan  05:56
I hope you have a great time. I'd love to hear all about it. You will. So also, Jordan, before we get into too much business here, I want to give a shout out to Bobo de bear. who adopted a raptor. Oh, a great horned owl. That is now joining the family of saline Nada. Nada.

Jordan  06:14
I'm just saying that they are traveling with Jurassic World.

Dan  06:17
I'm sure there's just they're available. They're not touring with Jurassic World. That's Oh, that's right. What was it called? Dinosaur?

Jordan  06:25
Obama that the park. Yeah.

Dan  06:28
So Jordan today we have a bit of an interesting situation on our hands. So we have Alex has just lost some suits. He has He's lost it. And now at this point, I believe it's three Sandy Hook related lawsuits in Texas courts. And today we have a little bit of his response to go over happily. But before we do that, Jordan, let's say hello to some new wolves. That's great idea. So first, Mr. Pickles, the dapper Doxon. Thank you so much. You're now policy walk.

Alex Jones  06:55
I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, Mr.

Dan  06:57
Pig. Next horse maps. Thank you so much. You're now policy.

Alex Jones  07:00
Well, I'm a policy wonk. Thanks, horse fans.

Dan  07:02
I have next Ruth Persephone. Thank you so much, Joe. Now policy.

Alex Jones  07:04
Well, I'm a policy wonk,

Dan  07:06
thank you through I go next, Mike, you're now policy.

Alex Jones  07:09
I'm a policy wonk.

Dan  07:10
Thank you, Mike. Next, Ben, thank you so much. You're now a policy wonk.

Alex Jones  07:14
I'm a policy wonk.

Dan  07:15
Thank you, Ben. Hey, we got to take the grave in the mix. Shout out to started at scathing atheist and now we're here. Thank you so much. You're now technocrat.

Alex Jones  07:22
I'm a policy wonk. Crikey made that's fantastic. Have yourself a brew. How's your 401k doing bro? We gotta go full tilt boogie on this, Watson. All right. Let's just get down to business. We ain't making that money off that heroin. Why you pimp so good. My neck is freakishly large. I declare info war on you

Dan  07:40
started escaping? There's no way. Yes. Thank you very much, Jordan. Yes, sir. So look, I mean, we all know what went down. Yeah, we were there. Yeah. We saw it all happen. Alex. I saw the

Jordan  07:52
news vindicated. Everybody has changed their tunes. Everybody realizes now the horrible mistakes they've made and they've treated him unfairly. Much

Dan  08:02
like Don to Grand Prix. I have some bad news. Oh, no. Alex got he lost. Some of these cases, yes. With prejudice. News came out at the end of last week that Alex had lost to Sandy Hook trials in Texas court with the judge in the case, given the parents a default judgment. These two cases, initially were the ones brought by Leonard Posner and Veronica Dela Rosa, and the one that was brought by Scarlett Lewis. It took a little bit longer for the news to break on it. But there's also a third case that Alex lost that day, which was brought by Neil Heslin. I wanted to get deeply into the weeds on this development, but you know how I am with these technical issues, sometimes dropped the ball. So I just kind of embarrassed myself. Sometimes I get emails from people who are like, You don't you don't know this term. I believe in our first deposition episode. I called the guy a prosecutor. Yes, I embarrass myself. So you know what I think would be great. What What if, what if? What if we could get the Sandy Hook parents lead counsel Mark Bankston to come on our show and help explain it?

Jordan  09:05
Oh, well, yeah, but I mean, there's no chance of that happening. Never. That would never happen.

Dan  09:13
All right. Hey, everybody. Welcome to this segment. We're gonna do something a little bit very out of out of the norm. Yeah. We're thrilled to be joined by lead counsel for the Sandy Hook families. Opposing Alex Jones. In court.

Jordan  09:32
Yeah, that no, that's you're telling the truth. That's the weird part. See, when you when you announce something like that, on this show, we're supposed to be being ridiculous, right? It's supposed to be a friend doing a character. Yeah, exactly. But no, Mark Bankston. Now we're gonna throw.

Dan  09:47
Welcome. Thank you for joining us.

Mark Bankston   09:49
Thank you so much for having me. I'm glad to be here.

Dan  09:51
I appreciate you taking the time. I know that I imagine there's some press requests. At this point.

Mark Bankston   09:58
They're boring. They're absolutely boring. I mean, who wants to talk to you know, Anderson Cooper? That's not fun.

Dan  10:03
Yeah, he's so but if you did go on Anderson Cooper and talk to him, you could talk about his nose disappearing. And that

Mark Bankston   10:14
was it's funny the reason I mentioned that as my partner Kyle Farah was on Anderson Cooper Friday night, talking about the disappearing nose and that whole insane proposition that for those who aren't regular followers of this case, Mr. Jones contends that one of my clients, Veronique dolorosa performed a fake interview on a blue screen in a CNN soundstage, rather than actually being at Sandy Hook.

Dan  10:40
News disappeared. Right? Because

Mark Bankston   10:41
you know, just a little bit a little nose disappearing.

Dan  10:44
I would love it. If your your fellow lawyer who was on Anderson Cooper, did the I got your nose trick? That would have been awesome. is great. So I think the place I'd like to start with this, I guess, if if that's what we're doing is what happened? What's the can you explain the ruling that happened? Sure. Sure. I'm not a legal scholar.

Mark Bankston   11:12
So and before I say anything, let me also just say this, there's probably there's some ground rules that we're going to be expected to follow today. Sure. The the, the ethical rules regarding pretrial publicity, make me not be able to say a couple of things. For instance, I can't I can't talk to you about things like the credibility of certain witnesses or my belief on the guilt or innocence of certain people, all these kinds of things. Sure. There also becomes a sort of loophole when your opposing party completely abuses pretrial publicity and says the most insane things publicly that's sort of frees you up to get to talk. And so that's part of why I'm here today is that it's it's I'm a little bit freer than I would normally be because my opponent has made an absolute mockery.

Dan  11:52
This is this is the pot kettle statue.

Mark Bankston   11:58
Black all we want, is we this is a pot kettle situation.

Dan  12:02
Well, let me just say in relation to that, if there's any point where anything feels uncomfortable, or like past what you can talk about, just let me know. I'll respect that entirely.

Mark Bankston   12:12
Dan. Oh, lodge an objection and we'll get it ruled on

Dan  12:16
Jordans the judge?

Mark Bankston   12:18
Just Bobby Barnes it up in here and just

Jordan  12:23
work Barnes good work barns.

Mark Bankston   12:24
A little call back to the deposition episode. Let me tell you a little bit about what just happened.

Mark Bankston   12:31
It has never happened to me, it has never happened to anybody I know, outside of the most insane situation. All right, well, then

Jordan  12:39
I can cross one of my questions off the list, which was have you ever had a case like this before? The answer is never Gotcha. Have a case like

Mark Bankston   12:47
this. What happened is for the past three years, we have been in a situation where Jones has had discovery obligations. That means the court will enter orders saying yes to produce certain documents produce certain people for deposition, that sort of thing.

Jordan  13:01
Daft Punk albums,

Mark Bankston   13:02
he right? For three years, it has been an absolute mess. So not only is he not producing the documents, he's supposed to produce not answering the questions. And I mean, when we're talking about questions where there's stuff like, name all the employees who worked on these videos, and his name, the videos themselves

Dan  13:18
are mad, any of them that yeah, like factual based questions. Very, very

Mark Bankston   13:22
simple facts stuff. Yeah, they are not answering in any way, shape, or form. And then you have the documents they won't produce. And then you have the documents they do produce when they end up giving us a bunch of documents and turn over them in electronic format. Oh, one of the consultants up in Connecticut found that they had given us child pornography in those documents. Yeah. So

Dan  13:42
that was a mess of a fair. I mean, the bounty on Yeah. Maddie, you know,

Jordan  13:49
that one's great. I was,

Mark Bankston   13:50
well, it's, it's again, it's one of those situations where it just nobody has ever seen anything like it. So you know, we had a we had an, I think a credit to our judge in Texas who just recently retired, we had judge Scott Jenkins presiding over this, and he's an old scholarly judge who does things right by the book. And he was giving Infowars and Jones every chance they had to get in compliance to treat this correctly to I mean, a lot of other parties, they would have been done well before Jones, but you don't want to give Jones the ability to say I'm being railroad. Folks. There's a railroad job. They got me all set up. That's not what you want to do. And so we gave him every chance that he had, but after three years now we show up into our last year, and they basically just pretend like we have no idea what we're supposed to do. You know, his lawyers are brand new. He's on lawyer. Number seven.

Jordan  14:38
What is law? Yeah. As far as pretending goes with Alex's lawyers. I don't know how law works is a legitimate thing for a lawyer that works for us to say,

Mark Bankston   14:50
their best defensive display. Yeah.

Dan  14:52
We're doing a little while back norm Pattis was saying he was gonna get into stand up on Alex's show. So that's right.

Mark Bankston   14:59
You know, It's interesting, you notice that there has been a cavalcade of lawyers who have seen Jones as an opportunity to get themselves a niche carved out in the right wing media.

Dan  15:10
I probably would, too. I mean, I think that's a really rational thing to do. Yeah, why not?

Mark Bankston   15:15
Yeah. You know, oh, Bobby Barnes got it turned into a show on Infowars for a while.

Jordan  15:22
Not the career changing opportunity that he was hoping for. But guess

Mark Bankston   15:27
who knows? Right? Maybe it was exactly the career opportunity he was hoping for. I'll tell you this, when you're representing these cases, you never think you're gonna get so lucky as to have your opposing counsel be an actual Infowars commentator. Like, you don't get that.

Jordan  15:44
For us, we've noticed so long we've known it for years. But then you you say it, I discover to a person, a real lawyer, meaning it's in the real world and not just our show. That's ridiculous. It is completely ridiculous. You see

Dan  16:00
an amazing perspective on this or like sense of humor about it. Because, you know, watching the depositions that we did, it seems like it'd be infuriating. Like you'd just be banging your head against a wall. And I mean, I think most people would probably look at that and be like, I'm miserable. You seem to find some amusement in it, which I think is probably healthy, probably. Oh, yeah.

Mark Bankston   16:21
Yeah. Well, you gotta I, you know, I told people, when I first got on this case, I had to watch about 150 hours Infowars programming. And as you guys know, that messes with your brain. It wasn't a good thing to you. Yeah. And so, after a while, though, you kind of have to take a perspective on it, that you you embrace the absurdity of it all. And it's, I'll tell you this, it's, you know, it's particularly easy to find a good sense of humor about it all, when at the same time these things are happening, you are also just beating them up and down the courtroom. And in this case, when I'm sitting in that Jones deposition, and he is saying the most absurd stuff. Yeah, on some level, it's infuriating to watch him not take that process seriously. On the other hand, it's intensely rewarding when he says stuff like, oh, we ourselves, we never even investigated Sandy Hook. And thank you, Mr. Jones, thank you for telling me that. And that was was really good. But to circle back, because I haven't I haven't really answered your question is there done now. So this is over. For all intents and purposes, the judge has said, These people have disobeyed the rules with such intensity and with such consistency, that there's no way that my my judicial rulings are ever going to have any impact on. Yeah, so what she's done then is just declared judgment, which basically says, I'm going to instruct the jury that what he did was illegal, unlawful and cause damage to these plaintiffs. And their only job is figure out how much money that's worth.

Dan  17:50
Yeah. So that's the next step. Right? That's the that's where the the case goes from here into figuring out like, what's the price tag? Exactly.

Mark Bankston   17:59
And another one of those where nobody has any idea? Because nobody has ever seen anything like this?

Dan  18:06
Yeah. Well, one of the things that I know from Alex's response to the news of these these default judgments was that he said he produced all of his bank records from like, his entire life. Is that true? Or not to you? But to the Connecticut court?

Mark Bankston   18:27
Right. Yeah. So there's two lawsuits going on, just for your viewers. There's, there's there's lawsuits in Texas, and there's also a lawsuit in Connecticut. And he did have to produce some financial information in Connecticut. I haven't personally viewed it. But I know what was requested and what was

Dan  18:44
had to be produced. But he did actually produce a,

Mark Bankston   18:47
it was not a broad spanning financial inquiry and Alex Jones's life, there were there were certain records produced from free speech systems, mainly because what you have to understand and there's, you know, different different lawyers have different ways they approached cases, obviously. And in Connecticut, one of the big things that they're talking about, it's an interesting idea is that part of why Jones did this so often and so much is because he ultimately found it profitable is that if you can look at the records and see that sales for brain force and Male Vitality, were higher on the days that Sandy Hook was being discussed, then you can show a motive that he had to do it. But personally, I also believe you can look at this and see that his motive is genuinely that he started to hate these parents, that these these parents became genuine financial threats to him, because if they got strikes with YouTube, every time he put up a picture of their kids saying that they were fake, then pretty soon, just as we saw, he loses his life is, you know, livelihood in terms of YouTube. And he started to hate these parents. And for us that that really was his motive is that is I think there's a part of Alex Jones that knew it was trouble to keep talking about Sandy Hook this way and he just couldn't To help himself because he hated these people so much.

Jordan  20:02
Yeah, that's about right.

Dan  20:03
That's that's an interesting perspective. I think I think there may be something to that and there may just be like he's never really had any meaningful consequences ever in the past. Sure. Why Why would he change his behavior? If there's like he keeps Dukes of Hazzard himself out of trouble?

Mark Bankston   20:21
Exactly. I mean, look, the guy's never been in a situation where the answers to questions that people were asking him have any consequence or that he would be held to account for any of the answers. And for him being in a deposition was a completely new experience when he did not like at all.

Dan  20:35
It seemed like he loved it

Mark Bankston   20:42
because, you know, tell the truth. I came I came up in you know, my firm mainly had done corporate negligence products liability, civil rights, these kinds of big plaintiffs cases. And, you know, we have done big work in the past have gone after three M for medical devices, we've had large tread separation cases, we've had civil rights cases that were pretty egregious. Nobody ever in the history has done a podcast analyzing my deposition that

Mark Bankston   21:12
I've had. I gotta tell you guys sitting down and listening to y'all talk about that is an interesting thing as a lawyer to go through. One of the reasons that I'm on this show right at this moment, is I want y'all to go back at some point and listen to those episodes and viewers, y'all, y'all go back and listen to those as well. I want you to know that every single time that these guys say Alright, what's going on here, let's let's offer our guests as to what this means or what is going on here. What the strategy is 100% of the time, you're correct. Fine. I want to go over some of them with you and just laugh about some because you're absolutely dead on target. I love particularly talking about the Paul Joseph Watson deposition.

Dan  21:56
That That one was that one was the one that was kind of the least funny, but very interesting.

Mark Bankston   22:02
Yeah. Interesting, because because like you pointed out, Watson is very aware of how bad this is. And he doesn't want to be connected to it. And so in a lot of ways, it's strange. He would have never thought Paul, Joseph Watson comes out being the good guy, you know, I mean, though, it's interesting was he really worried about it because he was worried about the morality or because he was worried about the money, right? Like, there's that, that

Jordan  22:23
I felt like he came off like Stringer Bell, you know, like, he was above this fray, and he saw his friend go into jail for, you know, eight years and he's like, I have nothing to do with this. I'm just over here on the other side, you know,

Mark Bankston   22:37
you mentioned stir your bow, though. You gotta remember though, there's that email from Watson where he says, Jones, the Sandy Hook stuffs killing us these people are batshit. Crazy. And that kind of reminds me a stringer bells warning of like, you are writing down a criminal conspiracy.

Jordan  22:50
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it

Mark Bankston   22:54
is. While we're in that, it almost feels like Sorry, Jordan had said in that podcast. When you're done with Watson, you're sort of tempted to just go Lightning round with them. And just, you know, climate change. And let's talk about every and believe me, I had a list of every story of Paul Watson that I wanted to talk to him about. But you get to that point, and towards the end of that deposition, you realize this guy's my star witness? Right. It's a really interesting thing that so many of the people inside Infowars clearly the public record shows of these depositions that they don't know what's going on. They don't understand the hot water. They're in. Paul Watson did. Yeah. And as opposed to rob, you and Alex Jones. It's a very, very different situation. And

Dan  23:35
what's remarkable is that those emails that that poll had showed that he knew that them to keep it and that he tried to make others aware of it at the time. And so they have every reason to know that this is something that could be quite warm water.

Mark Bankston   23:56
Yeah, exactly. And what a contrast that is from what we saw from Rob, do,

Dan  24:01
we my favorite thing.

Mark Bankston   24:05
Rob do has a lot, a lot on his shoulders in terms of why we're at where we are at today.

Jordan  24:15
As the corporate representative, I'm supposed to know what

Mark Bankston   24:19
that was. And again, for your for your viewers who haven't watched what happened in Rob deposition. Rob do unlike the other witnesses, wasn't there testifying as himself? He was there testifying as free speech systems, which is Jones you know, subsidiary company that runs all this stuff.

Dan  24:36
He was the corporate assigned corporate representative to is shocked

Mark Bankston   24:41
that when you're assigned that you're given homework, you're given a list of topics, and you have the the corporation has a reasonable duty to prepare you to testify about those topics, and speak with the corporation's voice give the answers for the corporation, Rob knew had no idea he was supposed to do that. And the funny thing about that is You'll remember that's the first deposition, the first representative, just rob do shows up. He has no idea what he's supposed to do. He has no idea of D says, I don't know, to everything.

Dan  25:08
And then you kept having to ask back like, Do you not know,

Jordan  25:12
or? That's my favorite. That was my favorite, actually.

Mark Bankston   25:17
So I have to give us a shout out on this one because that was my other partner, Bill Ogden did that deposition, excuse me, and that one was in the midst of it. One of the most offensive and the amount of disrespect being shown for the process was infuriating. But the moment you get the transcript and listen to it, it becomes the most hilarious thing you've ever seen. Because you don't you simply are uncapable of understanding how a party can disrespect the process this much. But you can see it

Dan  25:41
in his eyes that Rob didn't know. Like, I think if you watch that tape of the deposition, it's kind of coming over him how unprepared he is as it's going along. I think he thought he could come in and Stonewall or whatever,

Mark Bankston   25:55
you know, the one thing I don't think that comes across in your podcast about it, because you did extract a lot of answers. In order to get the full spirit of it, you would have to include about 20 to 30 minutes of total silence during it was real, there are periods where you ask a question, and you're staring at him for a solid two minutes, and he hasn't opened his mouth. And in front of a jury that stuff doesn't look good enough to know that, but with so that's after the first time we did Rob, do you got to understand that six months later, they got called to do discovery again. And they designated him again.

Jordan  26:29
No, they did not. They did.

Dan  26:32
Worked out last time. Let's

Jordan  26:38
throw them bones.

Mark Bankston   26:40
Okay, here's Topic number one, you're supposed to talk about the sourcing and research on these episodes of Info Wars on these dates. Have you done anything to prepare for that? Nope. Didn't even know what have to do that. And so because it was it was so offensive that the judge at the next hearing is just scratching their heads of like I wrote an order saying that this was really, really bad. And then you just did it again. And at that point, even at that point, where we had gone through three cases with no discovery, child pornography had been produced, they had shown up to deposition twice and just totally ignored it. Nothing is going on, they still got another chance. They have to go on appeal, get this they could have completely won the case and dismissed all of these cases and still won on a legal argument which they didn't. But they got to do an entire another appeal, come back and then get another chance to answer discovery. And it was only after they didn't do that, that they were they were defaulted. So when I see Jones, for instance, getting on his show recently after this happened, and saying about how unfairly he's been treated, or What a travesty it is, I I've got to impress upon people, this does not happen and judges don't want to do it. And it took three years of this for it to happen. In this case,

Jordan  27:52
you have been given literally every available benefit of the doubt to the point now where the judgment used to be 100 pages long. And this is just one page of an ASCII middle finger. Just saying you owe money. Yeah, I

Dan  28:06
mean, like I think anybody who lives on Star Show probably is aware of how like, very clear from an outsider's perspective, it is that his strategy has been kicked the can down the road. Yeah, basically to make sure this doesn't go to trial, or like, and partially, and what's one of his legal strategies we've seen in the past has been, you know, if we protract this case, it'll cost the other people too much money, and they'll want to settle. Yeah, and that seems to happen a bit. And I think he was banking on that happening here.

Mark Bankston   28:38
It's tough to know what he was making. Yeah, usually is because I think there was at that time, and maybe he's still convinced of it that he no matter what happens, he's going to be a Larry Flynt hero who goes up to the US Supreme Court and everybody, you know, it's all going to be saved, and they're going to make a movie about what a hero he is right? Like, I think he might genuinely on some level have thought that. The problem now though, is that in order to appeal and go up to the US Supreme Court and vindicate yourself on the first amendment rights, you have actually had to have made a First Amendment argument and had a lawsuit of trial that actually happened here you've had no You screwed around of discover you're done. So you don't you don't get to appeal saying that your rights were no we never had an exhibition of your rights. We don't even know what the hell they are right now. So right now all we have is you have massively disobeyed a court and that's the only thing you'll ever be able to appeal

Dan  29:32
is going to Lenny Bruce net, he's gonna do it.

Mark Bankston   29:34
This is what happens when you have seven warriors, right? Like a series of seven mortars. You don't have a coherent legal strategy. You never had a coherent legal strategy. It was it was always about delay. It was always about just not facing this. And at some point, you have to face it. And that's what we're looking at now. We're setting out for March 28. For us to go pull some jurors and I mean, basically put on psychological evidence of what happened to our plaintiffs put on evidence how For the spread, you know, we're gonna have to go up to a jury of 12 people who, unlike us don't have a real firm understanding of what Infowars cultural footprint is. Don't understand exactly how big this was. So we got to talk to a jury about that. But in terms of them being able to say, what we did we were justified in doing it. Absolutely not. That's gone now.

Dan  30:20
Yeah, that chapter this is over.

Jordan  30:23
Yeah, this is such Owens fucking community service all over again, it's like, all you had to do was 30 hours of that is not a lot. All you needed to do was show up with the documents you didn't eat, and then you could have pushed it probably another year down the road, you know,

Dan  30:39
right. But that implies, though, you know, that there's a reason he wouldn't want to do that. Yeah, exactly. I mean, everybody has to be considered rational actors, and they're doing what they do for a reason. They can speculate about it, but it's, you know, it's a challenge. Yeah.

Mark Bankston   30:55
Yeah, it really is. Because I mean, that's the whole problem is there's so many times in this case, you want to try to predict what's about to happen, or, or, or by, by using a rational actor sort of scheme, and it never works, never once works, what you think is gonna happen is not whatever happens. And so we basically, the easiest way to have some predictive control on the over this case, is to at any juncture, say, All right, if I'm Jones, and I'm his attorneys, what would I do rationally? And then you can go ahead and cross at least that one off the list, because that's not gonna happen, right? Yeah, now, you just got to now you're throwing darts at your Chaos board and figuring out which one it hits. Because this is really how it's been, is there's no, there's no control or rhyme or reason over any of this. So again, that's how you get to the point where you go stir crazy like me, and you just laugh at everything?

Dan  31:42
Yeah, well, I think that at least partially, that response is the right response. You know, there has to be a little laugh there somewhere, there is a part of me is,

Mark Bankston   31:51
if there's a time to take a break, and reflect and look at this and go, Wow, hasn't this been absurd? It's right now. There's, there's next few months, we're going to be gearing up to do the very serious lifting, of telling the jury a very serious story about some people whose lives us can understand how they are right. And that that, honestly, there's where the anger comes from me a little bit, is that in the middle of this absolute circus of absurdity that Jones needs to be put through, that tends to distract in some way from the real gravity of what happened to these parents. And so when it comes time to put this on for a trial, and this is obviously you know, they're going to be media is going to be recording this trial, people are going to be talking about it. This trial is going to be deadly serious about something that has been distracted for way too long. Yeah. And to me, it is fantastic. That this trial is not going to be about Alex Jones. Yeah. What Alex Jones did and what he's about his already decided. And what this Charles is going to be about is about these families. Yeah, that there could be no better poetic justice. And that, that the the moment that he thought was going to be his circus that he could use for himself, he doesn't even get that

Dan  32:59
anymore. That is that is kind of gratifying. Yeah, as a as a as something you know. And I do think that there is too much that gets gets lost in you know, Alex will blame the gun grabbers and stuff for coming at him. And, you know, it's just a way it kind of I feel of deflecting from exactly what you're talking about the reality that at the core of this is these people that have gone through something unimaginable. Yeah. And I think you have to do that if you're someone in his position, because how do you how do you look in the mirror? If you don't? How do you deal with their real grief and your partner? Like, yes, it's very challenging

Jordan  33:36
that the thing he wants most is attention. And that is the thing that is going to be denied him is delightful. It really is, you'll find a way of course, he will find a way but he's not on YouTube or Facebook, as long as as long as none of the major media outlets go to Infowars and are like we're gonna put you on TV, then it will be fine. Until then,

Mark Bankston   33:58
we always knew to it would be it would be a spectacle without any content. Of course, it was going to be something that was just because it brings me back actually something to Dan, you said about these depositions and why they're kind of surprising is that if Infowars is what it is, and it is what they claim to be, then these depositions should have been the most exciting moment for them because it was their chance to put up what they had to you know they're saying they're right it's fine like put up or shut up. Here's the time you really get to throw down with you know, some commie attorney like me. You get to like tell him in his place. Yeah, you're just wrong. Look at all the stuff we have. And instead Jones and do even we're like I don't remember any of that. I don't know what you're talking about. We're not we didn't know Craig I remember the time John said in a deposition I didn't know preparation for this it gives me a headache. I don't even want to do this. This Yeah, yep. Come on.

Dan  34:48
Never heard of globalism.

Jordan  34:50
I had no idea what you're talking about. Who the hell's are out do what what do

Mark Bankston   34:55
we know? And here's the other thing I'm sure you'll realize this I got ready for these depositions, I became As experts such that it is in the Sandy Hook hoax mythology. And I can go toe to toe with anybody who believes this bullshit like a Wolfgang Halbig or a Jim Fetzer. And I was actually looking forward to going toe to toe with somebody who thought that they were confident about this stuff and destroying them. And it didn't happen. I mean, instead, what we got from Jones was, you know, Jonesy, you've said this before, didn't you know, I never said that. Here's a video clip of you saying that that's edited. I didn't stance context. Media Matters, edited clips. So we're gonna say, Nike, you can't get anywhere like there was this idea to I think that was really observant of you both that there's some things you can accomplish, basically, in that situation, in terms of testimony there, there are some admissions you can get very quickly. But but that's done in 1520 minutes, really, like, there's not a lot of legal significance that can come out of that deposition, that that it happens very quick. But culturally, I think there is a lot of significance to that deposition. And I think you're gonna see that at this trial, too. So we'll we'll get we'll get some. And in other words, I don't want to say that the show is over, you know what I mean? Like, there is a reckoning for Jones, that's going to happen, and it's in, it's going to be personal. It's not just going to be totally focused on my clients. So there's still some more to come.

Dan  36:14
Wow. That's, that's interesting. I don't know. I don't know how to respond to that. That's amazing. That's yeah. And I think that it's such a testament to the families that they've been able to have the wherewithal to continue in the face of, like, the difficulty of, of living through. I mean, the last three years of this case, even, you know, I couldn't I wouldn't fault somebody for saying this is enough. I'm out. Yeah, totally. And it's, it is really, on some level for the, for people who can't stand up to a bully. You know, it's it's pretty, pretty heartening that they have, yeah,

Mark Bankston   36:58
well, you know, I'll tell you, there are definitely families out there who were involved in all of this, who don't want anything to do with this, you know, who aren't in lawsuit and all of that court, and I completely respect that decision. Because, gosh, why would you want to get into any of this in a lot of ways, but it's really interesting that that my clients done in Texas, you know, where you have Linnaean, Veronique and Neil and Scarlett. Those are those are two families who were really heavily focused on, right like they put up the Posner's address to where they go pick up their mail. They said they were starting up anti First Amendment terrorist organization that was coming after Infowars. Viewers, they, they said the Neal Hudson was lying about holding his son with a bullet hole in the head, you know, like, it's this really personal crap. And so these clients are really stood up with their permission, because they were these personal targets, to be able to make this fight on behalf of everybody. And it's really been a brave struggle, particularly, you know, if Lynnie has been in this since the beginning. Yeah, within within a couple of weeks of this of the shooting, he wrote to Infowars and said, knock this off, why are you doing this? You know, this is Lenny is upfront about the fact that, you know, probably driving, once he dropped off that morning, he was driving away, he might have been listening to Infowars. He was actually kind of into that stuff, just because it was interesting to him. And to have these people stick because people don't want they sometimes don't realize is that we're talking about five years of straight harassment, followed by three years of the making a mockery of their lawsuits. Almost a decade, they've been having to deal with this crap.

Dan  38:22
Yeah. And the thing that Alex always plays games with is that idea of like five years of harassment. He's like, I didn't say all that stuff for five years on air. It's like, well, it's it's not that every day you were saying the stuff on air, it's that they have been subjected to this harassment that was facilitated for five years. Yeah,

Mark Bankston   38:41
I think you know, some people who aren't really up to speed like we are on Jones. Understand that he said things about Sandy Hook, but probably think it was it was a handful of occasions over a couple of years, that kind of thing. I was questioning, yeah, questioning. So that's the other big one I have to address as well. But you'll notice that if you watched his statement about in reaction to these default judgments, one of the things he said is you know I only mentioned this a couple of times, only a few times that I ever talked about Sandy Hook, and we don't because of your audience may not realize but but because of we bringing the suit and then there shortly thereafter, YouTube and Facebook deleting all their profiles Infowars has a lost irreparably a lot of its videos and content, it can't tell us everything. So we've kind of had to play Sherlock Holmes using the public record and try to figure out what videos were made and when. And right now our best estimate is that they made 100 episodes about Sandy Hook that employers have seen the thing we know that they made about 350 pages of Infowars articles about Sandy Hook. And so this is we're averaging about two shows a month over the entire span. Now there are some times when he hits it like to 2015 and 2017 years really hitting it hard. So those those more times, but generally five years of the straight harassment that people just don't know unless you're a real me. Everybody's seen the Media Matters clips right But but God when you really dig in there, I'm telling you, you have to sit there and you have to watch an hour and a half of an unscripted conversation between Jones and Wolfgang Halbig that will fry you.

Dan  40:12
You're one of the most prestigious policemen who's ever lived.

Mark Bankston   40:17
Exactly. Man on CNN all the time school safety experts. Yeah, they talk to you about Columbine. Yeah, all of that. And you hear it? Yeah, one of the things I mentioned to Jones, because Jones was was telling me about how credible he initially thought How big was and I was like, sir, you've done Skype calls with how big you've seen how big is home, you've seen how he lives. You've seen who he is, you know who this man is? Right? I wouldn't want to even use I mean, look, I would never normally say in a deposition. Look, you got 4000 emails from him and reading them, you would agree with me, this man is a raving lunatic. But I'd normally wouldn't use that kind of language. But Wolfgang, how big? And? You know, look, I don't I don't think that I think that that statement is a matter of my opinion. It's not a statement of fact. But if Wolfgang Halbig is upset about that, please, please sue me, Wolfgang, because you're a raving lunatic, and you have caused enormous pain to these families. And Jones knew that like, because that's my other problem is people. The number one question I get on these cases is, does Jones believe the things that he said, and all I can do is point you to the public record. That's all I can do is point you to the public record into the deposition transcripts. And I think it becomes very clear that no, he never for a second thought these things were fake. You know, Jones talks a lot about your one of the observations you made that was very, very observant was the the idea of the media jumping on with both feet of this idea that he said it was a psychosis. And it's not it's not really what he said. He was making a metaphor, and it kind of was still pretty crazy. And it was a dumb thing to say. But there are people out there there are people out there who popular institutions, and and the powers that be and then just the shitty deal you get in life in America has made them distrust basically all official sources of authority. There's no question that that's a real thing that happens to people that it's not happened to Alex Jones, no, he's done that to other people. Exactly. profiting off of that, understands that phenomenon and wants to inflame and exploit it and be able to profit from it. And he can point to that as a justification. But he is not one of those people. He does not have that psychosis. No, but I think shows us that it all was malicious, every bit of it was malicious.

Dan  42:22
I think I think that, you know, when he could still be a slight victim of that, like that mentality in as much as he was getting caught up in it as he was producing that content. And it was becoming more successful. Like if he just wasn't aware of what was going on. And he wasn't aware he was not in touch with himself. Yeah, easily. Find yourself snowballing a little bit. Yeah. Well, I do think they're just radicalizing yourself at that point.

Mark Bankston   42:51
There's some moments where Jones is is he's he's he detaches from reality and just sort of free spins. And then that way, he may be sort of theorizing in ways that aren't totally grounded, like when he'll talk about an interdimensional shadow government or some shit like that. That's out there. And then there are other times where I think he has somewhat convinced himself of his own BS, you know, some very basic world events. So oh, the Syrian chemical attack was faked or something like that right now convince him of that. But when it comes to something like Sandy Hook was not an operating school. I don't believe Jones ever believed that. Or that there were there were kids who were recruited to play the parts of different dead children. And they were shot. He didn't believe any of that.

Dan  43:34
You know, what the scarier thought that I have is, I don't think he ever cared about the truth or falsity of it. Yeah, he never cared enough, like the expedience and the usefulness of this claim is more important than whether or not it's true.

Mark Bankston   43:46
Yeah, that's really interesting.

Jordan  43:48
And it was and and just the level of conspiracy theory is, is such that I have no doubt that, to a certain extent, he was just on autopilot. You know, like, he wasn't even paying attention to the fake shit. He was saying, because it's the same stuff. He said, The Last time,

Mark Bankston   44:03
you know, that's more expert has really harped on is that you can look at every single mass tragic, and it follows the same script, you can't really pick one. You know, it's it's interesting. When When Watson was in deposition, I asked him, Can you name me a mass casualty event, he didn't say it was a false flag. And he goes, Well, I think maybe more of the recent ones like the El Paso shooting, and then on the

Dan  44:31
we've heard him do it over and

Mark Bankston   44:32
over. And it is it's in the law of use it as when you have a person who is engaging in a course of conduct that shows a consistent form of behavior to advance their business, you can assume that they made the same the same justifications for this latest thing is consistent with everything else they've ever done. So the fact that he is within hours is going to call one of these events a mass tragedy shows you that it's a reckless disregard for the truth. That's not what's really important.

Dan  44:56
Yeah. And to circle back to something that we touched Ston a minute ago. It's not questioning things. Like there's such a distinction that he abuses. When he says like, I was just questioning events, and it's like, no, you're coming to conclusions. You're advancing a conclusion. In the guise of pretending your question. Yeah,

Mark Bankston   45:17
exactly. When you say there were men arrested in SWAT gear. That's an assertion effect. If that didn't happen, you're a liar. Like, it's not just you have a bad opinion. Right? Or the another one that he'll try to do a trick on you as he he will put it into question, but it will be a bit Obeah Why do you still beat your wife question? Yeah. And it's and it's that sort of thing. Why were there Why were there no, paramedics allowed on the school? Well, I'm just questioning things. Yeah. But your question is based upon a lie that there are no paramedics in the school. Right. So there's, it's never a matter of question. And these guys that don't question that's not what they do. They state false facts.

Dan  45:50
And there's that classic clip of him saying that he had didn't believe it was fake at first. But then he looked into it deeply. And it was all fake all actors. And that's not questioning.

Mark Bankston   46:03
No, no, no, it is not. I mean, there is some where it's, it's so unbelievably unequivocal of at first I thought they killed real kids. Yeah. But now I know. It's completely staged. And this is all totally synthetic and fake in oaks. And then they'll tell me in deposition. Yeah, I mean, I've questioned some things, but I've never questioned it and totality of saying whether it was staged if and you could just play the clip right

Dan  46:25
afterwards. It's just out of context. Yeah. And

Mark Bankston   46:27
it's, it's unbelievable that he can do it. And for me, I think what it came down to for Jones is, okay, so this is the scary part about jobs. The scariest part about him, his neck

Dan  46:37
is freakishly large. It's pretty,

Mark Bankston   46:39
he is a very large man. And he takes a lot of supplements, which could make him strong and fearsome in a fight. But the thing that really scares me about him is that I think that he deduced, perhaps correctly, that there are things more potent, more powerful, more useful in our current political dialogue than truth or verified facts, that there are magical narratives that can represent what we want and what we hope to achieve in our political agendas that are way more effective or useful than anything we could ever report roughly. And so when the info wore out

Jordan  47:13
there six Supreme Court justices who would say it's all about fairness and earning your way. I'm sure that it's about truth and honesty, I guarantee. truthful, honest people anyway.

Mark Bankston   47:29
But that is the scary part to me is that I, you know, look, I think you could probably imagine you get involved in these cases as an attorney couple years ago. And I started to get really enthusiastic about maybe some of the changes that could result from here now, not only am I going to do something for these families, but maybe there is a cultural change into how we talk about information. And then over the past three years, what have I seen, you know, I've seen a man who has been able to use his own frivolous disrespect to delay this process for three years, so there's no accountability. And over that same course of time, all of his more industry established contemporaries begin copying his formula, you know,

Jordan  48:10
are you talking about Mitch McConnell?

Mark Bankston   48:13
You know, the one that springs to mind most potently to me is Tucker Carlson, of course, yeah, of course, Carlson looks more like Infowars now than he did three years ago, and that's scary to me.

Dan  48:23
He looks more like Infowars than Glenn Beck did in 2009.

Mark Bankston   48:27
Tough truth, right? At least at least Beck had this sort of pseudo staged production of his writing on chalkboards, and it's just all kind of silly. Now, Carlson's is terrifying. And that's the same. Hopefully,

Dan  48:39
there's so much overlap that Alex will just play long segments of Tucker's show on his show. It's right at home. There

Mark Bankston   48:48
was somebody used to tell me there was one of my one of my colleagues, Genevieve Zimmerman was involved with the the lawsuits against Jim Fetzer in Michigan, where Lenny Posner was able to to win a defamation suit against Jim Fetzer, interestingly enough, by virtue of Default Judgment when Jim Fetzer refused to participate with court proceedings, so sort of birds of a feather flock together situations, but gin in when she was helping out with closing arguments and come up with the line for Jake Zimmerman to use, which was calling what Jones did an alt right opium right. And I now is really resonated with that phrase. But then over the past three years, I told her that phrase no longer works, because it's not all right, opium anymore. It's just write opium, there is no alt anymore, that what Jones did and what his flavor for how to manipulate facts and stuff is now just lingua franca for the entire conservative movement. And that's terrifying. It does feel

Dan  49:42
like that. And I also think, like, just from my sense of things, just from my looking at everything. I don't think that he may even be aware of that like that he discovered something more powerful than truth. Right? I don't think he discovered it necessarily, but

Jordan  49:58
I mean, well,

Dan  50:00
don't think he knows what he's doing.

Jordan  50:01
Ultimately, we have a problem that you had in in the depositions, which is this. They know, you know, they're lying. You know, they know they're lying. So all there is the only question is, are you going to tell me that you were lying or not? So Alex is going to not say that he's lying. And he'll accept any default judgment, anything? Because then he doesn't have to say what everyone knows, and why he's in the courtroom. I'm lying to you. That's right.

Mark Bankston   50:32
You know, it's y'all didn't a discussion of perjury and civil versus criminal cases that was dead on point that if I was a criminal lawyer, I could I could roast these people, I could have them against the wall in no time. But But here in civil law, it's different. So the best thing that I can do is to hopefully make sure the jury understands that they also know that they're lying. Yeah, unless you see what their reactions aren't, because the reaction is the important part. Yeah, that's what we're trying to do.

Dan  50:56
I think you could probably fully demonstrate quite a bit of that. Jury based on those depositions.

Mark Bankston   51:02
Absolutely. No, it's going to be really interesting having them seeing them react to it. I'm excited for that. Yeah. So one thing

Dan  51:09
we touched on that we haven't gotten to yet that I was really hoping to get your perspective on was how you felt the coverage of the case was, Do you feel like the media at large, focused on the right points? Do you feel like, I think that one of the things that definitely become very interesting to me, over the course of the time that we've done this podcast, is seeing how people cover Alex, right, and seeing the ways in which no doubt sometimes unforced errors? And then sometimes people, you know, are like this is they they got the right point there.

Mark Bankston   51:44
To answer the first part. Do I think the media has typically gotten this right? No, no, I do not. And that's that's a shame. A lot of the media that's involved around Alex Jones is very clickbait media. Editors know that if they have a story about Alex Jones in the Sandy Hook lawsuit, it's gonna get clicks psychosis. Exactly. Same deal. And the big problem from my look, I'm not, a lot of people would say, All right, well, if you're getting my coverage wrong, you're usually almost always getting it wrong in a way that's critical to our show. And so maybe that'd be good, but no, no, it's not. And the problem is, is that Jones knows very acutely that his ability to identify mistakes made by the mainstream media is one of his best defenses is that if you overshoot the target on Jones, he uses that as a way to martyr himself. There was, in fact that so I was just talking about the Jim Fetzer verdict up in Michigan where there was, you know, one of his sources was was a lot of newspapers ran a story that that was Alex Jones, you'd got that. And Jones got on the show and made mainstream media look stupid, because he said

Dan  52:45
he was going to sue the Associated Press. Yeah, never.

Mark Bankston   52:48
You know, that's, there's there's been a lot of threats of lawsuits all over the place that never materialized. But it always gives him a good sounding board to say, for not being accurate when these people aren't being accurate about me. And that's, that's, that's a good point. But what Jones never understood about me personally, is that I'm not those media. That's not I'm not aligned with them. You give me a CNN story, defaming one of my clients. I'm so and seeing it in a heartbeat. Because I guarantee it's way easier than suing this guy. Yeah. He's got insurance policies and lawyers who don't mess around. They're gonna pay

Dan  53:23
the right to help them discover it. Yeah, exactly.

Jordan  53:25
You play.

Mark Bankston   53:27
Another example. You remember, a Boston Bombing, when the two Egyptian young men were identified on the front page of The New York Post? Yeah, just not a paper that you would is has a great reputation in terms of things like that in terms of reliability. But they've got a big insurance policy. They've got lawyers, they got a lot to lose. They took care of those young men without even following suit. Yeah. And we've got the exact same situation. In this case, I'm not sure if you're aware of the other suit that I'm handling right now. It was actually the first one was Marcel Fontaine as a young man in Boston, who was falsely identified as being the Parkland shooter, right? Same deal as I mean, worse than what happened these Egyptian kids because they were just like their pre people of interest. They might be, you know, they they put a picture of Marcel and said, Here's the guy wasn't because he was, was wearing a communist steam t shirt.

Jordan  54:14
Yeah, yep, there was

Dan  54:16
that was the one that like, had its roots in like 4chan, right.

Mark Bankston   54:19
Exactly. Yeah, they took a post off of 4chan and reported it with no cooperation,

Dan  54:24
which is they do that a bit. We've we've we've stumbled on a number of instances of that kind of journalistic integrity.

Mark Bankston   54:32
Yeah. And it's it's they are even you know, is even one point Jones was trying to define what a source was in deposition. source source can be you know, she started using Source Hey, that's, that's basically 4chan. That's what you're saying. You know, the bathroom. Think about the idea of that, that they want to say that journalism should be protected to the extent that if I see James cover a good time called Jane Smith on a bathroom Well, I can go with a paper and report. Jane Smith is a prostitute and

Dan  55:03
this is in the public interest. You're just asking questions about what's going on with Jane.

Mark Bankston   55:08
Yes, exactly. The people were talking about it right. You know, I'm just talking about what the people are talking about.

Dan  55:14
Their biggest case is someone's passionate enough to write on the bathroom wall. We tried to silence this voice on the bathroom.

Jordan  55:21
We have got one of the most important whistleblowers in the world. Their information is so powerful. They couldn't put it anywhere but a bathroom stall.

Mark Bankston   55:30
So it was it was it's funny that in Neil Heslin case, they were relying off of relying they had cited a blog post from a blog called Zero Hedge. Oh, yeah. Oh, we know that. Anonymously run libertarian financial freakout blog. I beg

Dan  55:49
your pardon. All of the articles are written by Tyler Durden.

Mark Bankston   55:55
Yeah. Had a blog post saying that Neil Hudson didn't hold his kid. And they and that blog post itself cited Jim Fetzer. So it's just garbage in garbage to garbage, right. But, but that was the blog post, and then oh, ensure your gets on puts that on air and says, Hey, I'm just reporting on what zero I just say, when he puts up the Zero Hedge blog post, you can see the page, it has three shares at that moment, right? Like nobody in the world has seen this. This is obviously Infowars and Zero Hedge your hand in glove and like doing this sort of thing, but to say that you're just reporting on what other people are saying. So I'm just going to bring on old Dr. Steve P. And just let him go nuts. Just wind them up. Just let them go. And you know what you're doing? You knew we have the emails that are in this case that have been filed with the court that show that before they put Dr. steepy on they know exactly what he's going to say and encourage them to say it and you gotta

Dan  56:47
you gotta get him in a deposition gone.

Jordan  56:49
God, I want it so bad.

Dan  56:52
We would do a whole series of episodes.

Mark Bankston   56:54
Everything. No, it's there's so many names that you can't get to Johnny Bravo would be a just a wonderful guy to have on the show some point. You know, this whole thing. But yeah, Dr. steepy is a great character. If you haven't had,

Dan  57:07
if you could ever get Alex back under oath. I'd like you to ask him if he believes he's fighting the literal devil. I don't I think that might be unprofessional for you to do, but it's something I'm very curious how he would answer

Mark Bankston   57:18
that speaks to his state of mind, don't you? I mean,

Dan  57:22
he's led me to believe through listening to the show that he definitely believes he's fighting the literal Christian devil.

Mark Bankston   57:28
Yeah, the literal one. Yeah, exactly. And that's what I kind of want to know is in the deposition. From his standpoint, do I smell like sulfur? From across there?

Jordan  57:37
Like? That's a good question, though. Can you some

Mark Bankston   57:39
I'll tell you this, though. You're You're assuming that we don't see massive contempt of court in the next couple of weeks. Your wish will be granted because he is currently set to be deposed again on October 22. Oh, I

Dan  57:53
can't wait. I hope I hope that video ends up on YouTube as well.

Mark Bankston   57:58
But here's the other thing you have to remember. Is that it like when I deposed Paul Joseph Watson, you'll saw that I had emails, right. Like I didn't travel documents. I had some things to talk to him about. When I deposed Jones, I did not write at that point in the proceedings. They had not yet produced anything. I was flying completely blind. And that Jones deposition was based on my own research, nothing that came from the company. Now we're in a very different situation. Now we have things we so you know, a lot of the song and dance that a lot of people saw was was Jones's hemming and hawing about who dan de donde was, and whether the employee, whether whether he sent the Kraken to go harass the people of new

Jordan  58:36
contract or never met him before in my life.

Dan  58:39
He hired him and he calls him the crack. Nope, no

Jordan  58:41
clue what he's talking about. Never met

Mark Bankston   58:43
him. It shows my frustration with with how Jones talks about this case publicly and how it comes out in the depositions and all of this. When you don't have the documents he'll say, Yeah, we got rid of damage on you. We didn't like what he was doing up there in Newtown that just really bothered us. We had to get rid of him. And then six weeks later, you get the emails and it shows. No, they were still paying him through 2016. They fired him because he embarrassed them at a Trump rally. He was making some inappropriate comments to a female conservative journalist at a Trump rally and they were like, we can't have that anymore because we got to preserve our relationship with these conservative media outlets, and we got to make sure we can still get into Trump rallies. And so they didn't care that Dan Madani chased a bunch of people around Newtown, right. They didn't care. They hung out with Wolfgang Halbig. Well, you've got how big showing up in a white unmarked van taken video of children at the Catholic private school. None of that. Do they care about?

Dan  59:34
No. He was a madman after the Boston bombing press conference. Yeah. After He disrupted that and got so much traffic to Infowars. Yeah,

Jordan  59:44
that one he dined out on for years. Yeah, literally. Yeah. Well, you

Mark Bankston   59:48
realize, oh, I'm sure you're trying to make the same mark. He basically tried to do the same thing with the

Dan  59:54
proceedings. Yeah, with the impeachment. Exactly. Right.

Mark Bankston   59:57
So and that's why and you know what? Other things that we brought up at our last hearing is we were granted in 2018 We were granted an order saying that we were supposed to have Owens deposition along with several other people, and we never got them they refuse to produce them. And now I'm in a position of who I really want to ensure his deposition and I'm not sure I'm going to get it because there's a very good chance he could be in federal custody by the time I want it. And because right now he's in a situation where he's facing these charges for breach of basically federal trespassing wouldn't normally be that serious except he did it a year ago and didn't show up for community service. Yep. We told the judge to look we're concerned not only about that deposition but that's why we want this deposition of Jones in October is because we're a little worried if you look onshore years arrest affidavit with all the pictures of Owen Shroyer being places he's not supposed to be. Jones is standing right next. Yeah, we're expecting an arrest fairly soon.

Dan  1:00:55
I wouldn't I wouldn't expect anything from Alex because the reason that Owen got in trouble was because he had a restraining order that because he didn't do the community service. He was barred from being like in all of those places. That Alex being there with him I don't think it matters as much because he didn't have that like sort of

Jordan  1:01:15
Yeah, so that he wasn't trespassing that's the

Mark Bankston   1:01:17
theory anyway, I mean, look people say a lot of stuff and I don't know what's happening in the federal investigation but sure they'll say whatever they could get Jones off off of those pictures is such a minor crime is to not even be worth the trouble so

Jordan  1:01:29
and as you can tell more than anyone else it would be trouble

Mark Bankston   1:01:33
but I think I think we've all seen enough mafia movies to know what why the Federal authorities might go arrest somebody like Cohen Shroyer, right like I think we know what they're thinking about what Owen Shroyer could give to them a could lead to

Dan  1:01:46
see could lead to exactly yeah, you you follow the

Jordan  1:01:50
crazy as we want that I patched Oathkeeper This is where we start. All right, we're gonna get oh and and then we're gonna get that fucker and then it's gonna be over bring me.

Mark Bankston   1:02:02
I mean, the thing about it is it is it's a distraction to my case, right? Like it's not great to have this criminal stuff going on alongside of it because it is a distraction. And I want this over. I want this to be done as soon as possible. Because it is for these families. They're ready, boy, are they ready? Just you know, it was interesting a couple of years ago, we got them to admit under oath that Sandy Hook happened. That was sort of like a big step for the family assists. They were like, Okay, that's that's one step. But we got to get to the end here. Finally, maybe happening? I don't I don't know. I was getting real pessimistic. I'm gonna be honest with you guys are really pessimistic not about our case. Because I knew I would pursue Jones to the end of the earth and grind him and dust. That was never a question to me. But was it actually going to make a difference to anybody anywhere? What I mean, first, could I make a difference for my own clients good? Could we even collect from him all those sorts of things. But then I started seeing, gosh, when I start seeing Coronavirus, hit, and I started seeing just the absolute insanity of the false facts being put out there. When I saw January 6, go down the big lie around the election. I'm like, Are we too far gone? Did these lawsuits need to be brought several years ago? Or is this too late? What's going on? But I'll tell you the last couple of weeks, I'm feeling a little more optimistic. I think I bet taking notice of this,

Dan  1:03:15
I bet that there's a real like feeling of exhaling, you know, like that. At least on some level, it feels like

Jordan  1:03:21
you're on the way up, at least instead of settlement on the way down to even lower wherever it can go.

Dan  1:03:28
Because you're at the mercy of somebody who's dragging their heels as long as they're allowed to drag their heels. Exactly. And really is that way and once the you know, the judge orders No, he'll dragging?

Jordan  1:03:39
Yeah, yeah. Then everything starts moving a lot quicker. Yeah.

Mark Bankston   1:03:43
One of these things, too, that occurs to me about it is like three years later, and it's it's funny, they are the cause of their own demise. Like I feel I feel pretty good about how I've handled this case. I feel like I've done some really good work in it. But the truth of the matter is they are the cause of their own demise.

Dan  1:03:57
I think anybody I think anybody who spends a bit of time listening to Infowars or knows it, semi critically would never expect anything other you know, like, I do feel like they would always be the root of their

Jordan  1:04:12
Yeah, yeah, I

Mark Bankston   1:04:14
think that's true. When Jones was really mad after our deposition, he got on and talked about me for a couple hours. One of the things he was saying is you know, they're all They're all calling his lawyer the new Perry Mason you know, and all this like, that's cool. But honestly, most credit goes to you man. Like I wish I could take more of the credit than I am. But it really is a man who is self destructing in almost a an epic Greek tragedy sort of way. Yeah. And I'm just, I'm just here as a conductor on the train. Like I'm just I'm just driving them to the station. Um, there's no at this point, there's not there's no turns to be made. It's just a track going to one place and we're just going down the track. When we

Jordan  1:04:56
go back to the 2003 episodes, there is a certain feel Like you're looking at the man who is inexorably going to wind up where we are right now, you know, like his behavior then will eventually lead to where we are. Now, that's going to happen with

Mark Bankston   1:05:12
some of that, I saw that you're looking at some of those earlier episodes. And I haven't, I mean, that takes me back to my college days, you know, like when I was in UT around like 99 2000, that's when Jones started become kind of huge, moving from public public access to what he is today. And I really want to now go back and listen to some of those episodes for 2003. Because to see the sort of embryonic chaos agent, or a meta

Dan  1:05:35
bizarre, one of the reasons we went over, he interviewed a guy who had gone to heaven. And it was so

Jordan  1:05:43
fantastic. It was fantastic. There's a waiting room and heaven. Your best friend is your imaginary friend, and he's also the guy who's snitching on you to God,

Dan  1:05:51
he's your guardian angel. Yeah, is your childhood

Mark Bankston   1:05:54
transition, though that occurs of Jones that I know that y'all seen it through the history. I mean, like one of the things that becomes obvious to me when I'm watching these videos is you watch a video in 2013 versus 2015 versus 2017. The sets are different. Can you see the evolution of the show through its sets? And now it's this big, gaudy scene in looking sad. And it's funny to me how there are so many things that I know from what I think of Jones from what I came up with him in the 2000s is not who he is today. Because to me, Jones is the guy who's about to be in tears over the alien fish hybrids there in the tanks and removing their flippers and oh my gosh, never said human eyes. That human right, the sad, right? And it's so silly. It's so in people. For so many years, people made viral video clips and stuff that were just making fun of these silly things Alex Jones would say, and then somewhere along the line, and it happened. Almost. I mean, John is faced on Sandy Hook, look in both directions. It's from Sandy Hook forward. It's a completely he's starting to edge into a completely different thing. There is not just so he's not a lizard person, silly, Jeff Rense style absurdity. Now there's something more sinister because it's been portrayed as hard news, right? Like, I'm not going to be showing my jury a lot of videos from him and the 2000s talking about the gay frogs, or the fish hybrids, or that kind of crap, because what they need to see is that ever since then, in the last few years, he's tried to sell himself off as legit news. How many times a day Infowars says you're getting the real truth here at Infowars. The mainstream media is fake news. We're tomorrow's news

Dan  1:07:26
today. Oh, wow. Yeah, right. That news of the future now admittedly

Jordan  1:07:31
shares a lot of news from six months ago, but it is tomorrow's news stuff

Dan  1:07:35
and blog posts, six months,

Mark Bankston   1:07:38
almost, or welling in about tomorrow's news today, right? Like this idea that he's creating himself. Oh, man, that's wild.

Dan  1:07:46
I had one question that I definitely needed to ask you. So I want to just I want to I want to jam this in. And is that

Dan  1:07:53
what's your favorite Sunday? That was it.

Dan  1:08:02
And Alex's defense after these default judgments came out. He said that in this case, the opposing counsel was demanding that he produced something he referred to as Sandy Hook marketing material. What can you talk a little bit about what he could be referring to there? All right.

Mark Bankston   1:08:22
So he's mostly talking about the Lafferty case and kinetic. He's mostly talking about that Connecticut case. And it's not even with this stuff that happened, not even with what just happened. In other words, the discovery requests that were at issue in Texas that made him default, the case, none of this has anything to do with that. So just make that clear, right off the bat. But in Connecticut, they had asked him, it wasn't really Sandy Hook marketing materials. Basically what it was, is they wanted any, for any episode that Sandy Hook was discussed about. They wanted Infowars internal analytics, right? They want to know, what did they get off a Google ads, what did they get? How many hits? Did they get these sorts of things. And then Infowars also uses things like an internal Google Analytics program. It has some other metrics that it uses there. And they wanted to request all of that, which makes sense, pretty fair request, you got to know it, particularly the amount of views, right? Because if you want to establish how these people were damaged, you have to know how many people saw it. Right, like so. Ultimately, the total audience of Infowars is important. They asked for also, I think if they had if there were any emails that referred to special marketing initiatives for Sandy Hook, and by that, I mean, guys, we're gonna make a special promotional page or we're going to promote a can you make sure on this video, can you promote some Sandy Hook videos because they've been really popular? If there's an email like that, obviously, we want to see it in terms of like, like, you have to remember that despite despite Infowars revenue, and it's in it's in this and it sets and everything, ultimately, at core, it's not a very sophisticated business doesn't so like, yeah, we're not like hey, can you reduce this your marketing director that you don't have one of those like don't.

Jordan  1:10:03
Yeah, and the way he's gonna be robbed you again? Yeah, it's just gonna keep being robbed do ya? Okay, produce anything for me it's gonna keep being robbed dude. It's just gonna show up, Rob do.

Dan  1:10:12
Exactly. Yeah. Because the way Alex makes it seem is like they're demanding that I bring like to them like these flyers that we printed up with Sandy Hook sale going on. I produce that.

Mark Bankston   1:10:28
No, I mean, there is there's obviously a lot of when you're a digital web business you publishes on the web, you're gonna have some statistics about what happened to your videos. And those are things they want. But what's what's mind blowing about? It is that is that in my case, we aren't even there yet, like, like we have, we have just recently got started to broke some of those issues. But in my case, it's like, okay, here would be a sample request that they're not answering is identify every video in which Infowars discussed the Sandy Hook tragedy that has never been answered, right? Like these are very, very simple things. And that was what I think was most shocking to our judges that you have these requests that were supposed to be answered in 2018, like at the very beginning of the case. So you can even start feeling your way around in the dark. Right? Like Like, this is so basic. And so for Jones to go on there and pretend like he has been unjustly had his right to a jury taken away. This is a flatly absurd. Yes,

Dan  1:11:23
I agree. I was just I be kept here. That's one of the sticking points is that seem

Mark Bankston   1:11:28
really, it makes me think that there's something out there that he doesn't want to give us in terms of that, because he really is focused on this whole Sandy Hook marketing thing. And I yeah, I understand why he's

Dan  1:11:38
so hung up on it, it might just be that he doesn't understand what he's being asked.

Jordan  1:11:42
Look, I hear you guys ever run a Sandy Hook 50% off sale? It's probably a question he doesn't know the answer to and definitely doesn't want to find out the answer to. We could have done that. So I just don't want to find out. I do I do love. I do love the judge being surprised when you ask that quite give me all the videos where you have said something about Sandy Hook. And the judge was surprised they didn't do it. Immediately. My thought was just like, oh, they said that sounds really hard. And just didn't do it. Right. I was like, how could you guys be surprised by that? I know these people, they said, that's hard. I won't do it. And then maybe you'll go away?

Dan  1:12:22
What's half of that? It's half of it's hard.

Mark Bankston   1:12:25
It's half of we've been so insanely negligent, ever since being sued that we have caused massive amounts of evidence to be destroyed and can never produce it to you. And if they ever have to really fully just be upfront and admit that that also has some pretty severe consequences.

Jordan  1:12:42
Yeah, that's not good.

Mark Bankston   1:12:43
I'm at this point. You know, that's that's honestly the challenge is going to be as for those of people who I know your your audiences, for those who watch this, these proceedings, the challenge going forward is if there's any more shenanigans, how exactly do you punish them? Right, like, there's not much more you can do at this point?

Dan  1:13:01
Yeah, that was that was a question I had in my head to like, you know, it because you still have the process that you have to go through in terms of getting to the jury deciding the damages. Absolutely. And he does have the some ability to drag his heels on that still,

Mark Bankston   1:13:19
absolutely does. And in order to cause other crazy problems, you got to remember, my plaintiffs are going to be asked to give testimony soon. And some of the things are going to be tested by them testifying about our confidential private health information, that sort of stuff. And they've already made a mockery of that stuff up in Connecticut. You know, they don't know if you'll follow this one. This one was fascinating to me, of just how detached from reality their strategy has become, is they were in the middle of deposing a plaintiff, Sandy Hook parents, right. And the deposition itself is designated confidential attorneys eyes only started the deposition, which means this doesn't get released to the public. And in the middle of that deposition, Norm Pattice, their lawyer started

Jordan  1:13:58
live streaming, basically, basically, he did not start doing.

Mark Bankston   1:14:03
I mean, didn't live streaming. What he did was he started writing down the things that the plaintiff was saying, the confidential testimony, inserted that into a motion and then filed that motion publicly with the court on the court docket where everybody can get a copy of it. And okay, so now the part of this that's going to make you just your jaw drop at this is not only is that insane? The motion that he was filing was a motion to request that the court compel the deposition of Hillary Clinton. Yeah, yes, because apparently, according to Jones, these lawsuits The only reason they happened is because Hillary Clinton was mad. And then for some reason, like about two years after she lost the election, she decided to go recruit some attorneys in the Sandy Hook families to pursue a vendetta against Alex Jones and that apparently I'm under Clinton payroll and all this type of

Jordan  1:14:52
stuff. Not sound like something a malignant narcissist would invent, ever do. Right? That sounds crazy.

Dan  1:15:00
Think I think he thinks that Hillary said he had a black heart or something like that. That was the sign that she's coming after me.

Mark Bankston   1:15:10
Well, you know, in Jones's own feverish sort of construction of all of this, Hillary Clinton is a big reason why he said some of the things he said about Sandy Hook, particularly after 2016, is because when she used him as a prop, to attack Trump, and to say, Trump's associated with this guy, and this guy's a mess, right? And this guy said, Sandy Hook didn't happen. And everything she said about him was 100%. True. But she was using him very clearly as a campaign prompt to try to score some points. And I got no problem with that, whatever. But but once he did that, that enraged Jones, that was it, because Jones at that point was on this trajectory to become very mainstream. He had he had got Trump on his show, he was being credited at that time with Trump's victory. And so that's why just after the election, in November, right after the election, he did a broadcast called Alex Jones final statement about Sandy Hook. And basically, he couldn't stop talking about it, because Hillary talked about him. So he had to respond back. So his genius idea was to get on there and go, Well, look, here's all the reasons I thought it was fake. And, honestly, if it hadn't been for that, like some of this case would have never happened, right? If the parents they were of the position that if Jones had stopped after 2016, they probably wouldn't have pursued this. Right. But it was this vendetta that kept up is that not only did he do it, then, but then just a couple of months later, in the new year, in 2017, he did a video called Sandy Hook vampires exposed. Yeah, yeah, that's the one that accuses my clients of faking them. bluescreen ever. So here we are in 2017. And he just can't stop. Because He also posted these parents. He's so pissed at Hillary Clinton.

Dan  1:16:46
Also rough name, I would I would fire whoever named these videos. Yes, Sandy Hook of vampires exposed. Doesn't look good, just as a title. Not great. You know, though, like, I mean, I can understand him being mad at Hillary. You know, she's been his villain for 20 years. And

Jordan  1:17:04
also she lost and ruined everybody's life. Exactly. So I mean, I'm sure he's mad at her about that, too. Yeah.

Dan  1:17:13
Well, I don't know if there's any other points you want to get to. But I feel like Yeah. Is

Jordan  1:17:18
there anything that the media has not said at all that you want to that you feel like there's some information that nobody has really touched on? What really surprised

Mark Bankston   1:17:29
that nobody in the media reported that in his 20 is November 27, I'm sorry, is November 2019. deposition is second deposition, that he ended that deposition by saying Epstein didn't kill himself. And that, to me is hilarious. It's like you you have made this, you understand what a mockery you've made of this, that you're willing to do that at the end of that deposition?

Jordan  1:17:54
Promotional Yeah, I learned

Mark Bankston   1:17:57
during that deposition, he was so eager to talk about Epstein. He really, really wanted to talk about Epstein. And then I kept telling him during the deposition, no, oh, don't we're gonna get to Epstein.

Dan  1:18:06
No, I believe. I believe there was a point where like, I promise, we'll get back to

Mark Bankston   1:18:11
what he promised. And I'll tell you, there were several points in there where his eyes glaze over, because he doesn't know what's happening. Because he's like, Oh, my God, I'm agreeing with a lot of this thing. This guy's saying right now, I don't know what to do. Because I'm sitting there telling him like, I think you and I agree that most of the people who run this world who are in the ruling class of this country in the world, are mainly psychopaths, and criminals. And he was like, Yeah, I do.

Jordan  1:18:35
Yeah, it's very strange,

Mark Bankston   1:18:36
because, of course, still wants to cast me as something that I'm not really, really interested in making it seem that I'm a democratic operative or something like that, in a, we were talking a little bit about his motion to depose Hillary Clinton and his sort of obsession with this idea that these lawsuits were entirely motivated by Hillary Clinton's vendetta against him.

Dan  1:18:56
Yeah, persecution complex. It's weird,

Mark Bankston   1:18:59
because it's like, Do you think there's really that shortage of many people who would love to do these lawsuits?

Jordan  1:19:05
Like, hey, only Hillary could hate me, there's no one else in the world who could want to bring me down, right? It's it's funny,

Mark Bankston   1:19:14
because Okay, so just some inside baseball on this is that as a plaintiff's lawyer, what I do is when people come to me for help, they don't pay me any money, right? Like, I'm sort of, think of it like a pirate, right? Like, somebody comes to a pirate and says, The Spaniards took all my gold and I want you to go get it back. And I'm like, Okay, I'll outfit a fast ship with a lot of guns. I'll try to go get your gold, I'm keeping a third of it, and I'll front any expenses. And if I don't get the gold, you don't owe me anything. I'll just I'll eat that expense. That's basically

Dan  1:19:43
you're working on spec, as they say, in the industry,

Mark Bankston   1:19:49
your privacy, your lawyers say it is you know, you talk to these lawyers who build by ours, and you say, that's not me. I'm a plaintiff's lawyer. I eat what I kill. And that's basically how it works. And so for me Most of my cases, I'm gonna say if I'm involved in a medical device case, or if I've got a product case, I've got to pay experts. I, you know, my firm, we're putting in 200,002 50 into a case before we see a dime on it and trying to make that happen. Alex, this case hasn't cost as much. And honestly, it's just different than a lot of cases that we do. And Jones is convinced of this idea that it must be funded by Hillary Clinton or something. And we've been really upfront about it since the beginning, my firm, fair and ball is fronted every expense on this. We're happy to do it. We're excited to do it. There's not many law firms who do what I do. Who wouldn't love to do this?

Dan  1:20:34
I mean, have you have you produce the Hillary Clinton marketing materials?

Mark Bankston   1:20:39
You know what I was waiting for a request for production on all my George Soros emails? Sure, sure. Those. But yeah, what they never figured out? Look, you know, it's interesting, you look at the law firm up there in Connecticut, who's doing that Connecticut case, the cost cost firm, and they're very buttoned up very normal kind of law firm, very respectable, you know, have their, their ties on really nice. I'm the guy on a profane podcast about

Dan  1:21:06
slightly different approaches. Right.

Mark Bankston   1:21:09
I'm a little bit of a different lawyer. But what I don't think they realize as I came into their lives, representing a Young Communist out of Massachusetts, and not Sanyo goes into the Sandy Hook parents came to me because I brought a suit on behalf of this young communist and I am not a Hillary Clinton offered, that's there's no way shape or form. But they never get this. And they they, the entire Infowars organization is convinced this is all about a political vendetta against them. When when really they just opened themselves up to this. Yeah, it could have been anybody who did this to them.

Dan  1:21:41
It's a terrifying combination of just like narcissism and black and white thinking, you know, like, just absolutes. And everyone is against me, because I'm the greatest

Jordan  1:21:52
it is. It's funny, he talks about international global politics all the time thinking that he's a big time show, but really, he only knows like, 10 people, so yeah, exactly. Okay, so who's bringing this lawsuit? I don't know any of these people. So it's got to be one of the 10 people I know. Exactly. Yeah.

Mark Bankston   1:22:13
Yeah. When you have that simple of a worldview, it just you cram everything into it and run out of character.

Jordan  1:22:19
He has a really small world. It's just really small place in his head.

Dan  1:22:23
It's like a sitcom with a low budget. Not a lot of locations, not a lot of characters.

Jordan  1:22:29
Mainly mockumentary style.

Mark Bankston   1:22:32
My other kind of final thoughts and this is addressed to the State Bar of Texas when they finally review this and listen to me talk on this as Listen guys. I know we've we've been a little loose and wild today and little profane here. I know that I did my my invitations Alex Jones. I know it did a couple of those. Just want to for the record, he imitated me first. So I think it's fair. He compared me to Gollum and said that I was a gremlin even said he was gonna make a little goblin Bankston doll and I just that hasn't happened yet. Because I'm I am number one who's gonna buy one? Oh, yeah. He started it. Okay, so I just I want that to be fair for the State Bar. He started it and in all seriousness, it has been a situation where his his public statements have been absurd. I've for somebody look, I have the opportunity to be on national television whenever I want. If somebody wants talk to Sandy Hook lawyer, it's gonna happen and I haven't done that. I've done it fairly infrequently. You know, I've when we first started I went on the Today Show the very first time I've done a PBS Frontline appearance about this issue to talk about it. But other than that, like we don't that's not where we're fighting this and I wanted to come talk about it with your audience because one your audience is never going to be on the jury if there's anybody who wants to know which fight they're getting taken off not gonna make very interest or strong feelings and Alex Jones you will not be on this jury. So I'm not worried about influencing the jury for anything that I did want to come talk about it with you all because I feel like this suit has been really interesting to the wider culture and not enough really hard analysis has been done on it not enough real attention has been paid to it. And I know y'all guys come out and like to have fun with it. But y'all are doing a really big service. A lot of people have learned a lot more about what the show really is from Norwich fight and I just wanted to thank you all for that

Dan  1:24:23
dollar. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm overwhelmed to hear that and thank you that we

Jordan  1:24:27
react to your thanks completely. Your positive statements have no place here get beat.

Dan  1:24:33
I was talking to a friend last night about how we were going to do this interview and I was like, Man, I hope he doesn't compliment us. That's the thing I'm most anxious about.

Jordan  1:24:44
Nope. To shitheads in Chicago, thank you. Goodbye.

Mark Bankston   1:24:47
It's I was telling somebody last night I'm going to go on a show. There are there are you can count on one hand, the number of people in the world who know more about Alex Jones than I do. And I'm current really talking to two of

Jordan  1:25:00
them? You're talking to one of them?

Mark Bankston   1:25:05
I don't know, I think you could do some callbacks that I probably.

Dan  1:25:08
I bet you know more about Alex, most, but you're probably not in the top five.

Jordan  1:25:13
I've got a lot somewhere in my head. I don't have action. I don't have like the ability to call it whenever I want.

Dan  1:25:19
That's been I know, I'm being a petty narcissist. I'll take it. Well, thank you so much for joining us, Mark. I hope at some point we can reconnect and maybe check in another time.

Mark Bankston   1:25:33
Well, I'm sure look, if Alex comes on and says some more crazy stuff between now and trial, I'd love to come back and talk to you about that. We can talk all about it. But otherwise, let's try to plan on me having a verdict sometime near the end of April. And we'll come back and talk about what that means.

Dan  1:25:48
Awesome. Maybe right in time for my birthday.

Jordan  1:25:50
I'm all about it. I'm all about it.

Dan  1:25:52
Awesome. Well, thank you again, Mark. It's been an absolute delight to talk to you and wish you and everyone on your side of the case all the best.

Mark Bankston   1:26:01
We're gonna keep doing what we can do. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks, guys.

Alex Jones  1:26:07
Wow,

Jordan  1:26:08
that was illuminating. What are the odds? Oh, who would have guessed that

Dan  1:26:14
was a lot of fun. Thank you so much to mark for, for joining us and having that little chat. And for

Jordan  1:26:19
all the work. Spectacular, just spectacular job.

Dan  1:26:24
And congratulations to I think huge congratulations. I'm not sure if we articulated that enough in our conversation but like, you know, it's got to just feel great, at least that chapter to have come to a close

Jordan  1:26:37
and just sheer and just talking to him. You know, like, he pulled it off. Like he hadn't spent the last four years in hell, you know, like he pulled it off. Like, this wasn't a crushing, miserable thing to do on a daily basis filled with abuse bullshit, and it looking like it might never end you know, and he fucking did it. Yeah, hell yeah.

Dan  1:27:02
Maybe a little bit of that humor armor can help. Oh, yeah. But Jordan, we are not just here to have an interview with Mark Bankston. We are also here to discuss Alex's immediate response that he put out the night that these you know these yes these summary judgment that's right it default just came around. And so he put out he put out a little piece and it's not good. It's not not a very compelling piece of business

Jordan  1:27:31
any any bounties any, any threats. He

Dan  1:27:35
learned his lesson on that one I was on norm isn't there, watching Alex just drunkenly spiral. That's fair.

Jordan  1:27:42
That's a good idea.

Dan  1:27:42
So let's start at the beginning. Here is where we're at. It's the

Alex Jones  1:27:46
left. The left in this country has completely weaponized the legal system, and the judiciary. There are so many examples of it. But just last few days, a decorated lieutenant colonel who came out and criticize the hasty, horribly organized withdrawal of Afghanistan is sitting in a military stockade in a brig in a prison without even being charged with a crime yet, and he's already been there five days.

Dan  1:28:17
This is about Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Scheller, who had criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and a video that he posted on Facebook. He was relieved of command and put in the brig. Campbell is June in North Carolina, awaiting trial. This is pretty messed up and I can see how this would worry anybody but it has nothing to do with the left or the judiciary. This has to do with how they're different rules of conduct when you agreed to enlist in the armed services. There are military rules and they they apply to you and not to non enlisted persons. And when you break them, you can different sorts of trouble. These are martial laws. Yeah,

Jordan  1:28:54
yeah. You can't even really say no to him. Yeah,

Dan  1:28:58
yeah, because he violated a gag order after being relieved of command by posting the videos he put on Facebook. Scheller is accused of quote, showing contempt towards officials willfully disobeying a superior officer failing to obey lawful orders and committing conduct unbecoming of an officer. Yeah, I can agree that it might be a productive conversation to discuss how weird it is that the military has these own rules that it has for its members to be subjected to. But in terms of Alex's response to, you know, like he's, he's getting on air to talk about losing these multiple Sandy Hook cases. This has nothing to do with anything.

Jordan  1:29:30
I was about to say if I was directing this, I would have been like Alex, quick cut. All right, we're gonna start over. Okay, we're gonna take this again, it's just real quick. We're talking about your Sandy Hook lawsuit off track a little girl you've already left the station.

Dan  1:29:45
Okay, if this is the way he's deciding to start discussing, exactly. I don't have a lot of faith that this is gonna keep going or reach anywhere.

Jordan  1:29:54
I know everybody's read the news, but what they are not talking about is that it is still Fat bear week and the week l fat bear should be held sacred. Okay, if I

Dan  1:30:06
could be clear about this, I think Alex has to be more productive and less dangerous if he did just cover fat there we have everybody

Jordan  1:30:11
who would have a much better time. Yeah.

Dan  1:30:15
So yeah, this this was not good. Okay. I thought I thought like, well, we're not gonna get a whole lot here. But what we do get right off the bat is a little bit of a confused timeline of events, unsurprising.

Alex Jones  1:30:27
Now, if you go back almost 10 years ago, we saw the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook. And it was hard for Americans to believe that someone would go in and execute a bunch of elementary school students. And the internet quickly had questions and talked about anomalies. It was something that I only covered a few times on air. But what years later, evidence came out that some of those anomalies were not accurate. And I said suddenly, Sandy Hook actually happened. It was the minute that I said, I thought it happened that the mainstream media said, Oh, you said it didn't happen for attention, when in truth, almost had employees quit over it. A lot of people disagreed with me, including some of my family. And it was not a popular view on my show. I can speak

Dan  1:31:09
as someone who listened back to the entire period after the shooting, and with absolute confidence, I can say that that's bullshit. It's a good spin for Alex, because most people won't actually go back and check. idiots like Joe Rogan fall for this kind of line. But that is definitely false. But even leaving that aside, that clip makes no sense. Alex is trying to make two claims simultaneously. And it's really hard for both of them to be true. The first is that he barely ever talked about Sandy Hook maybe just a few times. And he was just covering what the internet was saying. And then the second thing he's trying to claim is that the coverage of Sandy Hook was so unpopular that some of Alex's family disagreed with him, and staff almost quit because of it. That seems convoluted. I don't know how both of those can actually be his accurate retelling of events. Well,

Jordan  1:31:54
I mean, he did it two or three times. And then there was such an uproar over it that he never talked about it again until several years later, whenever he finally said that he believes it happened and then everybody was like, Haha, now it's time to take you to the clean. Well, what

Dan  1:32:11
about those years in between where you're? I mean, he

Jordan  1:32:14
mentioned it maybe 70 100 200 times.

Dan  1:32:20
I mean, yeah, but I mean, but other than though, yeah.

Jordan  1:32:23
Like, I feel like I feel like you're the one being obtuse here.

Dan  1:32:28
I should probably get off my damn high horse. I should probably stop thinking like, Hey, I was just questioning things, man. Yeah. Why am I so uptight? Everybody

Jordan  1:32:38
hates the questioners, but they're the ones who lead us forward. Right?

Alex Jones  1:32:43
So the idea that I questioned Sandy Hook, because it was some master plan of mind to get famous, was completely asinine. I questioned WMDs in Iraq. I was right about that. I questioned babies in the incubators being thrown out by Saddam. That wasn't true either. I questioned Jesse Smollett. And that was a fraud. I questioned bubba Wallace, I questioned hundreds of other events out there that have turned out to be staged, like the Gulf of Tonkin. In 1964. They got us into Vietnam.

Dan  1:33:10
First of all, no one's claiming that Alex had a grand design to get rich and famous by way of lying about Sandy Hook, or at least that's not a matter for the courts. Right? Immediately, right. Alex is trying to implant that idea in his audience's head because it's a more defensible straw man than dealing with reality. Alex's list of things he's questioned is a little bizarre, though. For one, I don't think he was the one who questioned the Gulf of Tonkin incident, if only because it happened 10 years before he was born.

Jordan  1:33:34
Yeah, but he was the first person to really get into

Dan  1:33:37
it. Second, the cases of Jessie Smollett and Bubba wallace are the only two recent examples he comes up with. And those are both times that he just had a knee jerk denial, but allegations of racially motivated crimes. If you listen to our show, you'll find way more examples of times when Alex was very wrong about denying racist violence. You bring those times up? Oh, no, you're always batting 1000 So long as you pretend that all the times that you struck out didn't happen, and that's what his audience allows him to do.

Jordan  1:34:03
Of course,

Dan  1:34:05
what a what a cheat the Gillette cheat codes.

Jordan  1:34:07
100% he 100 Well, now he does get things wrong, easy's and 97% Alex is playing

Dan  1:34:14
like propaganda with a Game Genie. Yeah,

Jordan  1:34:17
fair. Totally. Now we're old. That one was definitely that one's definitely world shit.

Dan  1:34:23
That's the one large issue of his comment. But then there's another one and that is that Alex is not questioning things. He comes to conclusions. It'd be one thing if Alex's coverage was what he imagines it was. It would still be dumb and dangerous. But he was dryly reporting that online conspiracy communities had questions about alleged irregularities in the Sandy Hook case that could be argued to just be questioning what Alex was doing was persuading which is different than questioning. Questioning seeks truth through asking sometimes unpopular questions. Persuading has a conclusion that the audience is supposed to be drawn to And oftentimes you can ask loaded questions as a tool that you could use in the path of your persuasion. And that's what Alex does. Yeah. And it's nonsense. You're not questioning shit.

Jordan  1:35:09
Yeah. That's why in court, you can't do that. It's called a leading question. You're not allowed to do it the way if if Alex wasn't guilty of stuff, then he will be able to do the same stuff he does in the courtroom. The fact that he can't do any of the things he does, the moment he steps into a place where it means something should tell you all you need to know and it seems

Dan  1:35:33
to happen over and over and over all these people. Yeah. So look, man, Sandy Hook wasn't that big, a big part of Alex's career? It's no big deal. Look, man, please, it's not a big deal. No big deal.

Alex Jones  1:35:44
Sandy Hook is a blip on the radar screen, in the different stories, the 10s of 1000s I've covered but it's not a blip on the radar screen. For the lobbies that are anti gun, the big corporate institutions that seek to disarm the American people,

Jordan  1:35:59
the family successfully able to use, Oh, you didn't have those children. You didn't have to

Alex Jones  1:36:04
Remington into bankruptcy, and to demonize the idea of self defense itself, and to try to basically destroy and steal the birthright of self defense from all Americans.

Dan  1:36:15
That's just so fucking callous and just insulting. That's insane. His like he, he's saying that his actions are just like a blip in his career. But it wasn't a blip to the evil gun grabbers that it is against, and they're around every corner. Like, your response is exactly the same thing that I was experienced when I was listening to that. Yeah, you know who else it wasn't a blip for people who lost their loved ones, you asshole.

Jordan  1:36:37
No, I mean, it's a straight this is crazy. But what he's literally doing in that sentence is denying that there were victims at Sandy Hook. Well,

Dan  1:36:50
he isn't listed and ordering it. And then another thing is he's he's doing is he's taking away their agency. Yeah, exactly. Used in the game, the gun grabbers are trying to play

Jordan  1:37:00
again. They're not real well, no, no, no. They're not. They're who they really are. They're literally real. Yes. But their intentions are fake. Yes. Again,

Dan  1:37:10
their concerns are being weaponized by the gun grabbers in a way that would lead one to believe if you believe Alex that their concerns aren't real. Exactly. That is fucking disgusting. Isn't it?

Jordan  1:37:22
Is him doubling the fuck down? If you if you meant any of what you said about any of what you're saying right now? You'd say I'm sorry to the victims. Yes,

Dan  1:37:32
that's it. Also, this is like how supervillains talk? Like this is like it was just a blip in my career. Totally. Yeah, like from Street Fighter the day bison video village was a day you'll never forget.

Jordan  1:37:46
Tuesday. Nothing to me. Yeah, that's Oh my god. This

Dan  1:37:51
guy is a piece of shit. He's

Jordan  1:37:52
a real piece of shit. Unreal. Unreal. Fuck me.

Dan  1:37:57
Yeah, that clip was where I was like, well, we're off the rails.

Jordan  1:37:59
That's that's going in the money that's going in the money hearing. Play that shit right there. See, even after he fucking lost. He's pretending they're not rail.

Dan  1:38:08
Yeah, Jesus. Yeah. While while but Alex is really the victim here.

Jordan  1:38:12
I can't see any possible way. That's true. But I will give him a

Alex Jones  1:38:16
show story that I'll show you in a moment. Even their top legal experts says that these death penalty sanctions are basically a myth, because you're guaranteed to be able to try the facts of the case. So this is a legal theory they're trying to get through to get rid of due process, using the straw man of the demonized villain, Alex Jones, this and dangerous everybody's due process. Everybody's free speech. Now the system is hoping that they can have the Alex Jones law. That's what they call it to get rid of people's free speech selectively while protecting the corporate media's free speech. That's not how history works. Everybody is going to get burned by this.

Dan  1:38:54
This is nonsense. If anything, Alex has been given excessive due process and given every opportunity to cooperate with the case. And he's shown himself to be unwilling at every turn. This isn't the court depriving Alex of his rights. It's him shooting himself in the foot. Yeah. In the court order for default judgment. They specifically say that they have gotten no response and discovery requests since July 2, which was months ago. This isn't a court failing. It's Alex's sabotage. And it's pretty funny to like the order makes it clear that this is not a lawyer problem. It's Alex. Quote, it is clear to the court that discovery misconduct is properly attributable to the client and not the attorney, especially since the defendants had been represented by seven attorneys over the course of the suit. Regardless of the attorney, defendants discovery abuse remained consistent. Also, the Huffington Post article that Alex is talking about, it wasn't quoting their top legal expert. They were quoting Bill Ogden, who's the lawyer at Ferrara and bell which is the law firm that Mark Bankston works at. He's Bill Ogden is the guy who he referenced was doing the Robinson deposition. Yeah. So their pictures are even right next to each other on the law firms website. This isn't a lawyer saying that this is just a legal theory. He's saying that it's taught that way in law school because it almost never happens. Quote, it's extremely rare that a party in the parentheses Alex Jones and Infowars is ordered by the court to comply with discovery is sanctioned for failing to obey with the court's multiple orders, and then continues to blatantly disregard the Court's authority by continuing to refuse to

Jordan  1:40:25
comply. Yeah, it's, it's like if, let's say, Okay, how about this? Okay, so I murdered somebody. And then I took the knife home with me, and they arrested me and they were like, Okay, you just got to bring that knife, and then we'll get this all done with no. And every time I didn't bring the knife, and I was like, No, I'm just not gonna go. No, they were like, Okay, well, we have to do something. So I guess there's a fine or maybe just bring the fucking knife bringing the knife. And then I was like, no, no, how about instead, I go stand outside your courthouse and waggle my dick in your face, and then go and while holding the knife above my head, and then throwing it around and then spinning. And then whenever you grab me, and arrest me and put me in jail, he's denied my due process. True.

Dan  1:41:11
While we're on the topic of due process, let's talk Rob due process. Yeah. All right. Yeah, that was my one. That's the one. So Alex wants to set the record straight. He's He's given everybody everything. He's sure, sure. He's been the king of discovery.

Alex Jones  1:41:29
A judge issued default judgments a rarity in the legal world against Jones and Infowars, out of the conspiracy theorists failed to produce discovery records. Ladies and gentlemen, first, let me set the record straight. My lawyers told me in Connecticut, they said you shouldn't even produce what they're asking for no one's ever done this. And I said, I'm going to do it. They won't default me. I released all of my company bank records going back to Sandy Hook, and up until now, no one has ever done that.

Dan  1:41:54
So that sounds like Trump at the end there. No one's

Jordan  1:41:56
no one's ever done anything like this is the best lawsuit anyone's ever. Yeah.

Dan  1:41:59
So we talked to mark a little bit about this. And this. Who cares? It has nothing to do with the cases he lost. That's in the Connecticut case. Yep. Yeah. So this is just sort of like, again, throwing confetti. Yeah. It doesn't matter. This is a distraction.

Jordan  1:42:12
It is a it is a shotgun blast of bullshit at any wall that it might stick. Yeah.

Dan  1:42:19
So Alex thinks that there is a the case is really about trying to prove that he's paid by the NRA or the Mercer's or somebody, I don't recall that, which again, is just another side deflection.

Alex Jones  1:42:31
They have this weird, crazy theory that I'm secretly being paid off by the NRA or something to do this. Let them see it all. Let them see there's no money from the Mercer's or the NRA, or the Republicans or anybody. And so we did that, because the judge in Connecticut demanded it right here in Texas is all coordinated. They asked for less, but it was still substantive 10s of 1000s of emails, 1000s of records, it went on and on. But they kept demanding the Sandy Hook marketing records. I don't do marketing around Newsweek cover, I have products and sponsors that I promote and market for, and we gave them in Connecticut and Texas, that basic information. Yeah. So

Dan  1:43:10
that one flummoxed me, which is why I had to bring it up with Mark, because I didn't I didn't know what the fuck he could possibly be. What is he talking about? And I think that there's just a fundamental misunderstanding that he thinks that like, it's about the source of the funding, as opposed to tracking whether or not your analytics show that you know, that you benefit.

Jordan  1:43:31
Yeah. Okay. So the day after we did the first Sandy Hook story, we had a huge increase in traffic. And then the more we did Sandy Hook stories, the more we saw any increase in traffic versus when we weren't doing Sandy Hook stories, it's a very clear way to establish a pattern of malicious behavior for money. It doesn't even take it's not even hard.

Dan  1:43:49
And it's it's kind of tough to imagine the, you know, the image we have of Alex that he would spend any time poring over that data. Totally. He has employees. Somebody

Jordan  1:43:58
did. Somebody did otherwise. How are we here? Yeah. Is any of this real? If nobody has handled his traffic? Yeah, then fucking I quit. It's just cool. This is bullshit. Yeah, this is everything.

Dan  1:44:11
So look, man, part of the problem. Is that this judge in Texas, right? The judge won't let Alex have his lawyer that he wants.

Alex Jones  1:44:21
They say, I've covered up they say I haven't given any information. And so this judge and the judge previous because when I'm retired, and Travis County will never let me have the lawyers I want that are well known, famous, first of them that lawyers like Mark Randazzo and others are what and so we have local lawyers, most of which are brand new, they'll take the case and they go in and they get yelled at and they roll over and say, I'm sorry. We'll do better. We'll give you more. When the judge on the opposing side say we know you've got the information. This is like asking somebody for a confession. That doesn't exist. And that's what's completely crazy about this whole thing.

Dan  1:44:59
Wow. That's an interesting spin.

Jordan  1:45:01
I mean, you know, that's that's a question that I guess they just didn't answer in the they didn't ask in the depositions. It's just like, legitimately, you and me, man to man. Tell me why you're here.

Dan  1:45:13
Oh, that'd be interesting. Just just just keep going. What is your perception of what's happened? Yeah,

Jordan  1:45:21
what is happening? Yeah, I want to know, before we go anywhere, what do you think is going on right now? And are there? Is there like spinny lights around me? Do I have horns? Something

Dan  1:45:31
that I remember learning in some philosophy class in college? Was that like, the beginning of any kind of discussion that you can have with someone is like agreeing on the definitions of terms. Yeah. And like, if you do really kind of have to establish like, first principles about 1%

Jordan  1:45:46
Yeah, this a chair. Yeah. You say this is a chair. We agree. This is a chair, we can move from there. Good. Now, next word. We're gonna go through the dictionary. Yeah.

Dan  1:45:57
All these lawyers were just like little worms they were afraid of

Jordan  1:46:01
so funny. So funny. They're brand new lawyers, because that's all we could get to take this case. A good lawyer would be like, No, we'll never do this. So then they're like, maybe we can figure something

Dan  1:46:11
out. A lawyer takes on the case gets involved, realizes Alex is a huge mistake. Gonna maybe get them disbarred? Yeah. They Skedaddle and someone else comes in,

Jordan  1:46:22
your honor. I'm representing Alex Jones. Can I stop? Yeah, the court says fine. Sure. reasonable thing to do. But look,

Dan  1:46:28
man, one of the other problems besides Alex's lawyers, he doesn't get to choose the lawyer that he wants because they're maybe not Where's Cochrane at but well, isn't He dead? Yeah. But other people are as the ghost of Cochrane now. We're at the worth a court of Heaven SATs where it's being tried by Johnnie Cochran, some people are not qualified to practice in Texas are not allowed to they have passed the bar in Texas or whatever. And that's a problem. But the other problem, I think, is probably even more serious. And if Alex is to be believed, this judge does not know the law.

Alex Jones  1:47:04
The judge also who is known as a bomb thrower, who's known by the Democrats that I've talked to, as well is just unbelievably, ill informed about the law. They even quoted here in the Huffington Post of all places, who's attacking me. Let It's unheard of. Lawyer Bill Ogden with FAR ball told having a post that Gamble's default, that's the judgment ruling is a bit of a myth in the legal world, but not if they can make it real with me. Were you a judge just decides Wow,

Dan  1:47:36
bad sign that Alex didn't recognize the name of the law firm for our Ian Bell? Yeah,

Jordan  1:47:41
that's not good. That's not good.

Dan  1:47:43
That was weird.

Jordan  1:47:44
Are you alive?

Dan  1:47:47
I recognize that name. And I'm not being sued. You're

Jordan  1:47:50
not being sued by them for what could be a ridiculous number of monies. Yeah. And

Dan  1:47:55
for a long time, it seems like if you're, if you're in a protracted case, and the law firm, you know the name of the law firm against you

Jordan  1:48:03
to a certain point, they have been in this case so long, you would halfway expect them to have developed an almost collegial relationship, like, we'll go out and eat lunch together. We've just spent every day together for four years or whatever. Nope, still doesn't know their name

Dan  1:48:17
doesn't seem to. So Alex is being sued for defamation. For things he didn't do,

Alex Jones  1:48:23
and it's simple. They don't want me to have a jury trial. Did you know that in the you don't want you to have a jury trial. I'm being sued by people. And they say in the court case that I've never said their names. Texas law says you can't sue somebody, if you didn't say their name for defamation, but TRICARE, she'll hear me

Dan  1:48:42
so this is sort of true, but Alex is still lying. So the cases that were brought by Neil Heslin and Posner and Dela Rosa, those are defamation cases, because Infowars and Alex did say their names specifically on air. Conversely, the case that's being brought by Charlotte Lewis isn't for defamation because her name was never said, but her child was invoked. And thus she accused Alex of intentional infliction of emotional distress, right? She has a different charge, because the defamation statute probably would not apply. Right? I was just playing fast and loose with these details, knowing that his audience will never look into it or try to figure out the difference, or what it's like, I never said her name. I'll be in charge of defamation. No, I'm not in that case. Yeah.

Jordan  1:49:19
Yeah. In any situation like this, if you would, if, if you're a listener of Alex, just based on all we've had to do to like, narrow down what's actually happening, and how many different complicated things are happening simultaneously. Alex is giving you a very simple answer. Yeah, they've never heard of the law.

Dan  1:49:42
The judge is a bomb thrower formed on laws Yeah.

Jordan  1:49:47
So So I Okay, that's a simple explanation. I think I'm gonna go with the simple word. You know what keep it simple, stupid. That's the that's the philosophy.

Dan  1:49:56
I think. I think you probably self select for an audience. That is really in two easy answers. Very easy answers. So, congrats. There you go. Anyway, Alex is insisting that he's never going to get a fair trial. Oh, woe is me.

Alex Jones  1:50:11
So they're not going to give us a fair trial. Just like you're not going to give America a fair trial because Oh, Bernie has taken this country over, especially in blue cities in blue states. The Republicans have their own problems, warmongering surveillance, police state stuff, but with the left all of that, and Morris fused together with their righteousness, that they are in control of society, and that they rule the world.

Dan  1:50:32
Alex has every opportunity to have a fair trial. This is nonsense. Also, it seems really weird that Alex seems to be brushing aside the problems he has with Republicans when those problems are, quote, war mongering surveillance police state stuff. Sure.

Jordan  1:50:45
Sure. Sure. Okay, so the so the Republicans want to take over the world, watch us at all times and control our behavior. Hey,

Dan  1:50:53
buddy, how many documentaries have you made called police state?

Jordan  1:50:56
Yada, yada, yada? Sure, there's some problems there. But it's the left, right,

Dan  1:51:00
because there's sanctimonious.

Jordan  1:51:03
They just want us to have food. All of us.

Dan  1:51:08
They want a police state and they're snooty. Oh,

Jordan  1:51:10
okay. Okay. So no one's gonna starve in the streets. Really? No one. What's the fucking point of living in America? Ridiculous. Ridiculous.

Dan  1:51:18
I find this defense to be laughable. Like it's, it's a really dismal display. Yeah. But it gets a little bit sadder. And again,

Alex Jones  1:51:29
it's been years since I've even talked about this. So I'm venting a little bit. But in a way, it's a good idea. Idiocracy. It's so insane. It's almost comical. So we're gonna play a clip of the court see radiography at the end. And that's how I stay sane. But first, let me read you a statement from Paris.

Dan  1:51:46
I actually got my hands on this statement from norm pattern. Okay. Knock knock. Who's there? No, seriously? Knock knock. Who's there? Orange. Orange to orange. You glad you bought woke insurance? Man. It's hard to be white. Good joke.

Jordan  1:52:05
Okay, so you got one pod? You got a knock knock joke.

Dan  1:52:08
Yep. What else? Under the guise of it being written by nordpass? I

Jordan  1:52:12
know. I know. This is. This has been this has been a good day for

Dan  1:52:15
you. I got a call back to insurance and mix two. This is fantastic.

Jordan  1:52:19
Yes, yes. I you get five points.

Dan  1:52:25
Man Oh, boy. So we have one, one last clip here. And it's the end of norms, quote, okay, which is not the knock knock joke. It's exactly what you would expect from Alex's lawyer. And then this man, it feels like Alex is about to go to an ad. And he doesn't really but kind of soft doesn't add.

Alex Jones  1:52:44
It is not an overstatement to say that the First Amendment was crucified today. Fought King George Bowden over 76. And today we fight judicial tyranny. There's still some good judges, there's still some good FBI, there's still some good Justice Department, this country. And we're not going to fight these people with violence or with muskets. Like we saw 240 something years ago, we're going to fight them with the truth and justice in educating the public and taking our country back through elections, and through other legal and lawful processes. I appreciate the listeners keeping us on air. I haven't made a big deal about this last few years, we've been incredibly persecuted by these people. I've hired some of the top lawyers in the country. They've never seen anything like this in their lives. And so I just trust in God, and I trusted you to support us and I appreciate you all. So that

Dan  1:53:28
does kind of like that's that's a soft and yeah, and he goes out with the Idiocracy clip and just yelling about how he's gonna fight the New World Order. I don't know man. I found this this this. This response to be I wouldn't be underwhelmed by this if I was a fan. Yes. Yeah, I would find this to be

Jordan  1:53:46
you would need to more directly rebut the allegations against you.

Dan  1:53:50
I would I would feel like this was a little a little weak. Yeah. I don't know. And he's not even really theatrical. He's not a he's not full of bombast. Just kind of, not just kind of a, just a wet noodle.

Jordan  1:54:05
He's fucked. I think that's what we're hearing. We're hearing a guy who's just like, Whoa, I mean, the moment he said my lawyers have never seen anything like this. I was like, every single lawyer on the planet has never seen anything like you. Alex Allen has seen anything like no one has seen anything like you. You have ruined the legal system for lawyers, you they love that

Dan  1:54:30
it's just a perfect storm of narcissism enabling now and the political situation we're in well and craft like he has he has, you know, some ability whether it's in a loathsome area of expertise. It's still down. Yeah, I don't know. Ah,

Jordan  1:54:51
he's fucked. I'm just saying that over and over again thinking he's fucked. There's no There's no he thought that so many times in the past No, but there's a bad There's no way. God I can't even say it. If I say there's no way then I'm, I'm I can't do it. So we live in a world where that you can't say there's no way this happens. Yeah, yeah.

Dan  1:55:11
I have two thoughts about this kind of one. Is that Alex kind of one, in as much as he didn't have to reveal a lot of information that I bet he would not want to be public? Yeah, yeah. Totally. The inner workings of how they made their news, let's say Yeah, could be a lot more damaging to him than any financial penalty. Sure. So I do feel like there is that angle of this, but at the same time, that might be me being too pessimistic, because he still has the Connecticut case. Right. That's still going right. Further, as you get into the figuring out the damages and the jury trials in in Texas. If he does not cooperate, they may levy a penalty. That is

Jordan  1:55:57
huge. Yeah. That mean, beyond anybody's capability of paying

Dan  1:56:01
he did there, there is a decent chance you could end up seeing this bankrupt him. Yeah. I don't know that. That's the case. But he has a financial incentive to cooperate. In this phase of the trial. Yeah. Because if he doesn't, he's leaving it up to chance, kind of what they believe, is a fitting punishment and what he's worth Yeah. And I think that he kind of gives off the air of somebody who's pretty fucking rich. Seems like

Jordan  1:56:26
it. Yeah. No, I mean, the first thing I thought was as like, throw out 250 million. Just say it, just say it. fucking do it. Because that's what

Dan  1:56:40
that's what happened with was it miles Kwok would get sued Robert Roger Stone. Yep. He was like $100 million. And he was like, Man, I'm so sorry. Yeah, exactly.

Jordan  1:56:50
did not mean, whoa, never. I never said anything. And I apologize for all of it. Yeah,

Dan  1:56:56
I think that that's probably going to be one of the more interesting things to follow. Yeah. Is is does his tune change in terms of cooperation, when it comes down to like, now this is gonna hit your bottom line a little bit? You have a you have an interest in this? No, it's not just obfuscating, because eventually a decision is going to be made with or without you. Right,

Jordan  1:57:17
right. I mean, it just seems like it's, it's too much, it's too much happening all at the same time for them not to come back with something that is massively punitive, because we're dealing with somebody who's everybody is saying that this has never fucking happened. This is this is something taught in schools because it doesn't actually happen. So you've got that already. So your your summary, your your default, Default Judgment, money should be like up double just for that, just for the extra three years it took or whatever, you know, on top of that, you've got this guy who is essentially created the blueprint by which democracy has been demolished. You

Dan  1:57:57
can't punish him. In this case, you have to keep it. But

Jordan  1:58:01
what you can do is make an example out of somebody who behaves the way he does. I mean,

Dan  1:58:07
I don't want vengeance to come into it. But I do think I do think that

Jordan  1:58:11
absolutely not vengeance. I mean, straight up like this should be a simple like, Hey, fuck around, and you're going to look at a $250 million judgment

Dan  1:58:20
of aliens unfair?

Jordan  1:58:21
I don't think so either. I think it's actually kind of low. Honestly, ma'am.

Dan  1:58:25
Yeah. Well, I just don't know. I'm fascinated to see where this all goes. And I was going to get into like his actual show from after the period, but because we had this conversation with Mark Bankston. Yeah, I didn't want to overburden the episode and make it too long total and so for our next episode, we will get into some of the actual show response but for now, I'm I'm just like, I could see a number of directions this could go I know that he will obviously try and use it to raise money. He'd probably have another money bomb. Oh, yeah. And maybe Mike lindo will swoop in?

Jordan  1:59:05
I don't know. I don't know. There could be all by

Dan  1:59:08
the way. Mike Lindell was just on a telethon on Jim Baker's show. He was just a guest on Jim Baker's telethon.

Jordan  1:59:15
What is it? What is it about it's very close. They're all the same. Very close to covering the same shit. They're all the same shit. Yep. Doesn't matter where you go. The far right is the same shit. Yep.

Dan  1:59:26
So we'll be back, Jordan. But until next time, we

Jordan  1:59:29
