00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
I'm done working with dudes I can sit around for The Elder of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Joe

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
The second time we drove because something happened

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,312
We ripped do I'm not a one-page guy

9
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
That was as a cover-up for a better on the second arrest

10
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,320
Girl you're a little in your head on the second take because you were disappointed that the

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,464
The first take was so good down in your notebook not a one take

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,584
Cut you off at the past

13
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,776
I made a return visit

14
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848

For Sheriff Sage that you can burn to like purify places and what have you put the oils are those selection of bats.

Why haven't used them yet

00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
You risk too much power

30
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,536
Movies about sat

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,216
Hearing everyone's thoughts do you think it's a good one of those classic monkeys Paula type situations

32
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496

Very exciting

56
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,544
That wasn't for you this morning I just

57
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Do we have

58
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
I was going to say it's interesting

59
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
We have an episode to go outside

60
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
That's what I want I've been broken

61
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071

Becoming endlessly

64
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
What's ground down

65
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
Is May 11th 2021 blackjack

66
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
And

67
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Close out that

68
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
No that was brutal

69
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I'm getting ground down by is

70
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Is that

71
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
Think we've already talked about this show is

72
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
Incredibly OneNote anti-vax nonsense

73
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
And

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
When Alex comes through with something exciting like

75
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
One of these primary source document

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Like actually

77
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
This is kind of an interesting thing to look into this thing we can learn here short middle-aged device

78
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Fantastic

79
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
What fun we can have there

80
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
Other times Alex

81
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Just

82
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
He's got nothing

83
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
Sure and sometimes but nothing comes in the form of a bombshell

84
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,855
Tired of non-existent

85
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Haven't heard anybody polygon yet

86
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183

Pic.of

88
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
The like

89
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
The biggest news in the world being nothing

90
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
And just like that

91
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
Burnt out something in your brain you know where you just like something to be so fake excited about school

92
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,335
Something I don't know I'm going to be in the pasture the next episode

93
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
It is a little bit

94
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Exhausting

95
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
You can only be guess what so long

96
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
Before it starts to break your believing Alex little bit

97
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,159
It makes it less painful but the process is still there

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Frustrated

99
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Completely inculcated

100
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
From

Oh well don't whisper it into my ear and also

114
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063

4 birthday

123
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Sometimes it's kind of difficult because you do it at the bottom of a well

124
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Private that's right there on the pennies

125
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
Breadboards birthday I should say everybody who we wish happy birthday to I do throw a penny into a well on your behalf

126
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,695
I'm not sure whenever someone's birthday is on the weekend

127
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
Whether we should do this on

128
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
Friday shower on the Monday show what do you do

129
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
That's parent do it after the fact or do you wish them happy birthday a couple days early Patrick's Day when do you celebrate

130
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Observe

131
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
I never quite now but I'm going to go ahead and go

132
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Ahead of the game

133
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
Cameron's got a 30th birthday Nicole would like to wish you

134
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Congratulation

135
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
Happy birthday hope you have a great one

136
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
And hopefully doing this

137
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
If you'd heard this on Monday like I've been like

138
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,303
Wow that would have made my birthday a lot better if I had fokken heard it earlier but what if

139
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,423
She's so important to him but now the rest of his actual birthday is just going to be huge let

140
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
Down everybody's going to be like

141
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Happy birthday my birthday was when the knowledge fight guys said happy birthday for way too long

142
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
This is the risk we take

143
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,807
Jordan there's one bit of news that's been going around that it won't address doesn't come up on this Epic

144
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
So but it did something

145
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
At the beginning of this week and that is that Alex's back in the gold game my man infowars.com

146
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Alright it's about time

147
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
I've been seeing indications that he was getting ready to

148
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Start this back up again but I wasn't

149
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm sure if he was ever going to take the plunge

150
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,311
And that a large portion of the show on Monday with an interview with his new gold sponsor a guy named Drew Mason

151
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
From St Joseph partners

152
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,919
A precious metals outfit out of Pauli

153
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Pennsylvania

154
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,319
I don't know too much about this guy or his business outside of the fact that he decided to get into business with Alex Jones

155
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
The 2021

156
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,439
So I can't say much about what's going on with him but I know he's not cool

157
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
Cannot give this cold away

158
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
Partner with Alex

159
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,959

Dancehall with a chest buried in

00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111

169
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,303

170
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631

Good luck brick-and-mortar location for you pulled up

Specifically may have chosen

184
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
17 seven

185
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
96

186
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
As a

187
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
No I don't think so I think it's a coincidence

188
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
How is a city with Japan population of like

189
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,055
Just over 3502 why would they have a

190
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
Chopper it's ridiculous

191
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
It's a UPS drop box

192
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Better

193
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
Ugly already realized

194
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Delaware is attacks

195
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Haven type

196
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
Yeah yeah

197
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,511
Eat the green and Dover is a pretty notorious address

198
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,351
It's me location that's used by a company known as a red

199
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Mustard agents

200
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,447
Incorporated which allows people to incorporate their business in Delaware

201
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
A lot of folks do to avoid

202
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,543
But it's actually not

203
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,847
That it's not all about tax

204
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
The LegalZoom has a breakdown of the advantages and disadvantages

205
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
Incorporating in Delaware

206
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
When you file in Delaware you don't need to do

207
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
Disclose your directors and officers names to the

208
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
The state allows you anonymity

209
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
That's way better than not paying taxes have people for that option

210
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
This became an issue was New Years back as was covered in the Delaware News Journal in the SEC

211
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
EBay Stylo please

212
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Fighting games

213
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
In fraud

214
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
235 companies word issue

215
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
24 of them were based in Colorado other restaurant Delaware

216
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,991
And most of the businesses in Delaware where run through a registered agent Incorporated

217
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,599
Anything that's explicit wrongdoing but it's a it's a bit sketchy

218
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:16,255
I would say that the only way Alex we come up with a gold dealer I'd be less inclined to do business with and Ted Anderson is if it were

219
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,583
Who was the guy with no apparent physical address suicide appears to be

220
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
Explicitly saying that he got a phony incorporation in Delaware

221
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
How do you clear this and if anybody out there is actually interested in investing

222
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Singing precious metals

223
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
Have to assume that there is a safer better option other options that aren't just a weird dude with a

224
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
UPS drop box

225
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
It's there's at least

226
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Three other option

227
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
Renting a boat

228
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
Going under the water for Sunken Treasure

229
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
That's out that's in a way better option

230
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Of course there is

231
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,399
Globetrotting and stealing ancient artifacts from Egypt

232
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Turn the Lights sure that's always a good option

233
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
And then I guess this

234
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
Alchemy

235
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Yeah you're right

236
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
There's always four ways to learn

237
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
I don't know I'm not excited about this endeavor I think it looks really sketchy as hell

238
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Incidence of Alex having like

239
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Landing pages

240
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
With other people s***

241
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:23,071
Cuz it's like okay sweetheart Infowars gold.com but that just takes you to St Joseph St Joseph

242
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Yeah basically

243
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
So we get to May

244
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Garnet off the show

245
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Alex has

246
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Big news

247
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Does he ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday May 11th in years 2021 and

248
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
This is undoubtedly the most important news we ever broken today

249
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,255
Few hours I was pleasantly surprised

250
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
I got home and turned on Tucker Carlson to have dinner with my family

251
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
That he's robots

252
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Yeah I know that was 11 ruling upsetting image

253
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,591
I have the biggest news of my career

254
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,175
And I got sleepy last night

255
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Honestly you know

256
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
Around 11

257
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
Xanax kicks in and I'm just out

258
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
I'm in a life-and-death battle with the Devil

259
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
And

260
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
I have the

261
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,815
The Silver Bullet that will defeat the Devil

262
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,959
Yeah I mean I think that's one of the devil's big advantages he never seems to get tired

263
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
So I was curious about this big nose

264
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Decided

265
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
That day that I

266
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,831
Got the biggest news ever we already had the biggest news ever like twice this week

267
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Enzo's

268
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Happy bag

269
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Tucker Carlson

270
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
Fauci let the Coronavirus

271
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
Why isn't there a criminal investigation

272
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,655
Well we have the Smoking Gun or the director

273
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
For Bill Gates and for fauci

274
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:13,151
Who created the five and one super virus on video

275
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Episode of a podcast called this weekend virologist

276
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Do you produce by the American

277
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Society for microbiology

278
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
The guest is Peter dancing

279
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
The president of ecohealth alliance

280
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
How much grams is a director for Bill Gates but this

281
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
This clip that's from the actual interview seems a little bit at all

282
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
With that

283
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Do you have support from

284
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Say

285
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
Gates Foundation

286
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Gates money

287
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Thanks

288
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
You guys have a struts

289
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
AJF

290
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Specifically targeting things that like

291
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Incident

292
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
What two diseases

293
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Neglected

294
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
When will they consider

295
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
Anyway

296
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,439
Big mess up there are the Giant news of the day right out of the gate yeah that's not that's not a good story

297
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
This is a really interesting interview that Peter Daysha cat

298
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,631
But it's been completely misuse by Alex to paint the picture of a guy confessing to created Stars Cove

299
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Go to

300
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,287
In reality the ecohealth alliance of the nonprofit that works on global health issues from the perspective of what Peter calls

301
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
One Health

302
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,175
This is the philosophy that every condition has a human component an animal component an environmental

303
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Component

304
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,807
Trying to approach any condition without considering the intersection of these three is not going to be as full of a strategy

305
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Hitting the folks

306
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Picture into my

307
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
Beacon Health Alliance grew out of a conservation organization

308
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
That you can make pragmatic

309
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
An economically sound

310
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Free collage

311
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Conservation

312
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,959
For instance in the interview Peter brings up the unexamined health cost of deforestation that massively outweigh

313
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Prophet that are made from

314
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
The practice right

315
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
If it can be made clear to everyone.

316
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Decision-makers that

317
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Not only is

318
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Destruction of nature bad

319
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
What is also not even in the best interest

320
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Prophet

321
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
These people believe that they can make Headway towards conservation Act

322
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Right

323
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,695
I watched the whole 35-minute interview and essentially what it comes down to is that Peter discusses working with labs in many countries

324
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Including China

325
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
Where they do surveillance of animal populations

326
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,839
To try to identify any

327
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
One of the concerns he brings up his coronavirus has any disguises

328
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
How you can manipulate coronavirus is in a lab

329
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Pretty easily

330
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
How to take a nap statement to be

331
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,919
Confession the Peter combined a bunch of viruses together and then at least them is SARS coronavirus 2

332
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
But the reality is really different

333
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,015
It's really just about crafting lab test

334
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
Assess whether or not newly discovered viruses can even info

335
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Affect humans

336
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,439
If I were Peter daciuk I would immediately Sue Alex.

337
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
Totally there's a video with a picture of him with a title quote

338
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,839
Smokin gun video fauci project manager confesses to

339
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Creating covid-19

340
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,727
That's a definitive analysis reporting

341
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
Outrageous

342
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
Yeah then I can't imagine

343
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
How

344
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Unsafe

345
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
This is to do to somebody

346
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
Exactly what the line is her like public figure

347
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,439
But I'm not sure that I would put the president of ecohealth nonprofit

348
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Celebrity or someone

349
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,047
I guess an argument could be made that he's

350
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Become somebody who goes around on

351
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Some news program

352
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
I'm talking about

353
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
Autovision

354
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:22,847
Alex force him into becoming a public figure by giving him the attention that he should never have had in

355
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,943
In the first place

356
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
No I think I think

357
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Even without

358
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,855
Some of that he would have been seen as somebody who would be gone to for interviews

359
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
On on the early days of the outbreak are

360
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Made some media rounds

361
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,607
Forget what I'm saying is I'm not sure exactly where that line is

362
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
I'm not sure what side he's on but I would be

363
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
I would be quite literally

364
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
You worth discovery

365
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
You can't just do the

366
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Vista people

367
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
No I saw a little bit of that Tucker thing

368
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
And I just

369
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Began spitting

370
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Like I

371
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,879
The idea of him

372
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Doing that

373
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
After being

374
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
The cause of us

375
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
All being lock

376
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Lockdown for a

377
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
F******

378
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Year

379
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
That's grounds for immediate slapping

380
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
If you see him you get to

381
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
25 Tucker Carlson in the face

382
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,567
Viva Tucker piece was largely based on that article that Nicholas Wade Road

383
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Even that

384
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Doesn't claim to have a

385
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Occlusion

386
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
The second or third paragraph of it is

387
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,855
I have no direct evidence for either Theory whether it's a lab origin or natural origin

388
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
It's being used

389
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
People like soccer to

390
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Push the it must have been made in a lab

391
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
Alex's version is far more you respond

392
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Possible then

393
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Then we'll talk or should I

394
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Totally totally

395
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Which is which is normal but

396
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
He's anyway Alex got scooped by Tucker

397
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,663
I told you I was coming out

398
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
Tucker Carlson

399
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Broke it last night

400
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
About 20% of it

401
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,183
But the clippy didn't play we're going to get to that after we played undergrowth report apart of

402
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,815
Is that the director of the program under fauci and Gates on record funded by them

403
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,863
Volume box for justice program

404
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
Gave an interview and admitted they were slicing five viruses together

405
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
As a bioweapon didn't produce the club vaccine for

406
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
Emergency authorization to do it

407
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,295
Game over for these people as gentleman

408
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,343
Give the public ever grasp this

409
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Game over

410
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
Cost of being made up in that clip

411
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Alex plays

412
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Tucker clips

413
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Most

414
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
Like a lot of the first hours

415
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,471
That's a good job and I don't make a big enough deal out of this but like he plays

416
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
Lot of time

417
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Tucker Carlson

418
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
That's great it's

419
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
Salata

420
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Play some special report

421
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,711
Sometimes I love it I love knot

422
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Having to do my job

423
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
And that is a perfect

424
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Encapsulation

425
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
I will just let a

426
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Famous person

427
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:20,000
Bill in time that's great escape myself with him

428
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
It's brilliant brilliant marketing

429
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
I found this to be a little funny

430
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Your Tucker Carlson will come back

431
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
You're never

432
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Taking off the mask

433
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
Get ready for a lifetime of

434
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Tilting wet

435
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Cotton covering your mouth

436
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
Reduced oxygen flow to your brain

437
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,992
In a world where every stranger looks the same because no one has

438
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
As a face

439
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,112
When, Harrison her husband kiss the other day while wearing masks

440
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,392
They were giving you a

441
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
Preview of your daughter's wedding

442
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,000
Human beings net worth

443
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
Yub f****** babies

444
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,752
I don't watch Tucker Carlson that much so I don't know if this is like

445
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
Indicative of his style

446
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Holyshit

447
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
Do you got some

448
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Maigari dramatic writers

449
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
I'm going to watch instead of signing

450
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Language there should just be a picture and picture of a guy making the jerk-off motion just totally

451
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
That's a lot of dick

452
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,824
And I mean like a visit just like the next day the CDC released guidance that if you're vaccinated

453
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
Criminal

454
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:48,832
It should be criminal you when you see him in the streets

455
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
The dangerous precedent

456
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Your regular walk that back

457
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,280
There's only been we will only set this precedent for one person not sure I can sign off on that

458
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
What is

459
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,424
You're never going to be taking the mascots Huskies mascot

460
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:08,800
Great and Alex are the biggest news ever

461
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,688
Ladies and gentlemen on Alex Jones your house we're breaking the biggest news we have ever brought

462
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
We are incredible what's happening

463
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,088
Lab manager

464
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
For the covid-19

465
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,768
Added move when the scientist in Wuhan

466
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,888
Midtown video to merging five viruses together

467
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
To be able to then

468
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Your poison

469
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
Was listening to this and it didn't match

470
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
The interview

471
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Yeah it didn't

472
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
Seem at all accurate

473
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
He's on video saying 12:55 viruses

474
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Were combined

475
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Play that

476
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
What

477
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
A bombshell he confesses to it

478
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Really confused

479
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,400
It didn't seem like it was what I watch so I when they watch Alex's Special Report

480
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
About this

481
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,360
Patrick was talking about how some of the coronavirus as they discover didn't have known

482
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
The interview asked

483
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,944
Interview interview

484
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,992
I'll ask the follow-up question about that

485
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
Discusses how

486
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,184
Because so much of it involved with protein you probably want to create a vaccine

487
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
That was effective against

488
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Multiple Coronavirus

489
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Sure he was just

490
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,424
Just got to get in terms of like that lives that seems like something people would do if they were going to go that route

491
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,216
Not at all is a template

492
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,312
I've used viruses together

493
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,968
He's like Alex's pretending is guys like

494
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,296
Together with viruses

495
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:00,928
He's got some magical sci-fi technology words spinning around

496
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,280
Incredibly clear

497
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,560
Strongly point

498
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Did to that

499
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Alex is talking about this with

500
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Premeditated intention

501
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
Of hurting people

502
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
With the idea of shutting down the economy the idea of

503
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
Killing people in the developing world

504
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
Any saying that this guy

505
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
Is admitting to doing that

506
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
By way of creating the virus

507
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
Stocks are CO2

508
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,856
And I think you should be safe

509
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
Algebra suit call the man responsible for what would essentially be maskell murder

510
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
So

511
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,912
I would hope that that would be in Subway to Fable 2

512
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,960
Real playing with fire

513
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Especially considering everything we know about Alex's audio

514
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Okay

515
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
This is not a bomb

516
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
I talked about this quite a bit

517
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Amalfi Oaks

518
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,600
Pipeline shutdown

519
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Food shortages

520
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
In Florida

521
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Grocery store

522
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
So Alfie Oakes is the guy who owns that grocery

523
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Restore that I work at 2 in Florida for a week

524
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
A while back

525
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,104
Former oil pipeline expert

526
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Not but I don't care what he has to say

527
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:29,504
However it should be noted that he's only relevant in any way

528
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
Because he's made a big deal out of how no one has to wear masks in his grocery

529
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,488
In a completely unrelated story I would like to inform you that Ted Nugent tested positive for covid just one week

530
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,560
After doing an in-store appearance at Oaks grocery store seeds

531
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Table

532
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,448
Prior to this Oaks it appeared on Ted Nugent YouTube show called Spirit campfire

533
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Exit quote

534
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,800
No one is getting infected here no one's dying I want to get

535
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,848
The fraud it's a shame

536
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
And people have to wake up

537
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,688
These people

538
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,272
I'm starting to think that believing that

539
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:07,136
Witches are responsible for your problems is a recipe for getting covid

540
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,232
So Alex has this idea that no one else

541
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Says posting

542
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
Tucker Carlson Sega

543
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Hey and Sookie

544
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
He's going to put it up on his website

545
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Because he's

546
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
Content or anything

547
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
The whole thing posted

548
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
NFL player Carl Ruiz

549
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
14 minutes

550
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Supposed to

551
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Pinterest

552
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
Boston Amanda

553

Gone in an hour

557
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
5 minutes from now

558
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
I am going to

559
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Right here

560
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,944
This is all the documents you talking about and the videos

561
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
Total open-and-shut case

562
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,296
Where's the grand jury in America

563
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
If I had to show them this in the clip

564
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
Would not indict fauci

565
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
Have you really funny to see Alex trying to

566
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Cicuta Grinch

567
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
Yeah you know this

568
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,376
This Alex doesn't have

569
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Is hardness

570
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,240
It doesn't he realize I think he didn't actually read the story

571
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,056
I get a sense that a lot of points

572
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
That he didn't

573
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,616
Doesn't really have a handle on

574
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
The details

575
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
And he can't really weaponize the

576
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
The story

577
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Like this video

578
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,880
This podcast

579
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
The interview was

580
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Munsell

581
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,208
It may be a year old

582
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
March

583
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
2020

584
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
And if you going to look at it on YouTube months back

585
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,400
People are commenting on it like

586
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
Oh my God that's smoking gone.

587
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,824
Been in that spaceship for a while

588
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
It's just that Tucker brought it up the night before

589
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,992
How to make a bombshell out of it without actually knowing the story at all

590
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
And so he just

591
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:10,784
Kind of rushes

592
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
The air in it

593
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Stupid

594
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
I find myself

595
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,928
Just incredibly uninspired

596
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
And

597
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,976
At the same time I think it's

598
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,584
Incredibly funny that Ted Nugent probably got covid by going to This Guy's Grocery Store

599
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
Both guest on the show

600
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,168
Today

601
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Tweakers

602
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
That's

603
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,384
I don't even know how to deal with that honestly in like a real Universe where you believe in real like where you accept real

604
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Reality

605
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
I can't be in the headspace of somebody who thinks

606
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Any of

607
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
What happened

608
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Is okay

609
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
It's funny but it's not great

610
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
No

611
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
It's not the kind of funny I'm looking

612
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,048
Going for in the past for a little bit so funny

613
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
Anyway

614
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Fauci

615
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
That guy

616
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Tony fauci

617
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
We looked into the beginning of the pandemic end

618
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
Yeah that all star he's a legend deduct

619
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
The doctor Steve

620
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,360
One of the best one ever existed

621
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,688
But then all that went away really fast

622
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
Anyway he's got to be executed

623
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,136
Don't tell you them are going to be lucky they just going to let restaurants in prison at

624
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
A lot of them

625
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
It doesn't sit down through the courts I'm not calling for

626
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
I believe

627
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
They should be fried

628
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,400
Recreational biological warfare on the Nuremberg code

629
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,336
Oh I thought you meant tired to work for us

630
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,920
And we'll see who wins in the end of this but I know this time of God

631
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
God watches

632
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,528
Battlefield number Our Lives of our children

633
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
My soul

634
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928

On the East Coast

641
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
What's really going on

642
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,240
When a Giant Food price increases

643
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008

So yeah I just I said that to be

655
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Like

656
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Right

657
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
This is how it goes

658
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
Violent fantasies towards his enemies

659
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
Daf blah blah blah I love God

660
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
Food guys coming on to scare you I sell food

Yeah

662
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,344
That is that is really really late

663
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
It is really lazy

664
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,560
It's such a stark contrast between like

665
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,632
The bad David surrounded the middle-aged mice

666
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Because at least like that

667
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960

Minute Podcast interview with a guy from a year ago

671
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
But Alex

672
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
It's doesn't have a handle on it

673
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Do much with it it's just

674
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:29,184
Sister grocery store guy and

675
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,000

The other news in the world

Pipeline

679
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Backpacks

680
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,728
Yeah I heard the question my response to it was

681
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Okay Alex

682
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Vine

00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Can you got the

684
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
Keystone XL pipeline

685
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
It was opening a few months ago it.

686
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Close friend

687
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
All the oil from

688
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Around the Midwest

689
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,112
And then set up a colonial pipeline

690
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,160
3

691
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,048
Pictures of Shadow

692
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Suspect is

693
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:21,408
I have made up that vitamin is the Prime Suspect

694
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
Reporting is the most likely possibility

695
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:29,856
Interesting historical analysis

696
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
Play bigger bombshell than anything else

697
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Bombshell

698
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
President

699
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,840
Max owned by flight

700
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Yeah and also I can

701
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Can't help but like

702
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,496
Now that I know that Alex

703
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,336
You know back in the past would say that is prediction of 911

704
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Was based on historical analysis

705
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Sherman research

706
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
Cooper said that

707
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,576
I can't help it hear him say stuff is based on like research

708
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
You're probably lying

709
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
And you probably had a dream

710
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,256
You watch the net the night before and then

711
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
Transposed Biden's besan to Sandra Bullock which is a nightmare I agree fell asleep watching Tucker and now

712
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
You're a little bit of

713
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
NyQuil

714
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
You're f***** up man I

715
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,616
I still can't get my head around the idea that the whole family like gathers around it

716
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
Dinner table and they have

717
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Carl's in

718
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
I bet they do

719
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
Of course they do

720
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
That would be a

721
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
That's the worst thing I can

722
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,952
Can think of yeah I bet they don't do that I bet Alex sits alone and needs

723
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
All the time alone watching Tucker

724
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Take notes

725
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
So I'll be okay

726
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
This is on and it's mostly just about to fear

727
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
Spreading fear about food

728
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Wingstop

729
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
You also should know that if you want to take that seriously you should know what else

730
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Alpha bully

731
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
We know that

732
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Agenda

733
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:01,760
Is lockstep with every single thing that these globalist want

734
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
They're take over where the last Beacon end

735
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
I do feel I've I had I do it with all this

736
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
Doing that we see I do feel

737
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
I do feel very confident that we're going to

738
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
The country back this time it's not going to be

739
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,888
Easiest not going to be as fast as everybody wants but

740
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
Are American Spirit is still there

741
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
I stopped you

742
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
You know those eighty million people that voted for Trump and then somewhere in the 61 million

743
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,088
No thoughts Taylor let's talk about solution

744
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Sue Trump actually won

745
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
I'm working to get the country back

746
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Huh

747
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,560
Does he seem like a really credible source

748
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,352
Burger kind of guy you want to hang out with

749
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
What

750
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Is it about

751
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,704
White man and undeserved

752
00:35:56,032 --> 00:36:02,176
Is it come from then actually is looking into a mirror I don't I don't know I don't know if it's confidence that

753
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
This guy is undeserved

754
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Cuz I think he's asleep

755
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
Possible sleuth

756
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
And I base

757
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,112
Is that on this next

758
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Clip where do you live out of

759
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Conspiracy

760
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Almost certainly true

761
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Probably

762
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,560
Not come

763
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
Come close to proving it

764
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,704
Anna might also tip his hand a little bit too much at the end of this month

765
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Maybe

766
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,776
These companies like Masonic

767
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
Monsanto in particular by bear

768
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:34,432
Think about this for a long time and that you used to be

769
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,016
Conspiracy theory

770
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:43,904
Bike putting real fertilizer in the ground like organic fertilizer there putting this

771
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Mpk that

772
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
What universities are okay to use

773
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Bent

774
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,888
Because it's not nutrient-rich it grows an inferior product

775
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
GMOs.

776
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,872
We put in our bodies our bodies are starving to death. But we're not

777
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
We're starving because

778
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
The food that rating

779
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,968
Is not nutrient-rich

780
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
And then guess what

781
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
We get ill

782
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
And guess what company is selling you the

783
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Pharmaceutical drugs

784
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
Supposedly make you better

785
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
It's the same company

786
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,280
It's a vicious cycle

787
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,120
I don't know if they were that genius that created or if they did they'd just been

788
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
Let It Go on the way but

789
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,776
But this document where they give us the oldest has to then give us a treat

790
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Exactly

791
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
It's a hundred percent

792
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
And this is why I'm not

793
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,016
Because I have

794
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
Support your local

795
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
It's good that you're not saying that because

796
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
You run

797
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,768
Computers business

798
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
I think that's the only thing that unites all Americans except for the

799
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
The ones who work high up in Monsanto is that I think everybody's gotten high and yelled about Monsanto together at one point

800
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
Another of the practices they have

801
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
Disreputable and Roxanne

802
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
But I don't think it sent

803
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
Cibola to speculate that

804
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
They are making everyone sick it's so Bayer can

805
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Cancel

806
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,208
Or whatever event for Alex to say

807
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:26,816
We have the documents that make it

808
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
So not specific

809
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
You don't need any concern

810
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,520
Xperia Z theories because of business trying to monopolize

811
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Food is bad

812
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,456
Yeah give me before you go in at their entire existence is now based around trying to

813
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
Control food and everybody needs

814
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,576
I think ever

815
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
Making

816
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
Terminal C

817
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,184
You know that don't that

818
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
That's just so f******

819
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,792
Evil Creole downright

820
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:04,192
I'm not I'm not sure what you do to legislative company that would be interested in doing that I find

821
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:10,848
I understand why the profit motivation would lead you to that idea

822
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
But it's

823
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
That's no good

824
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
No absolutely

825
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,992
Much

826
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
I think that conspiracy to God is really stupid

827
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
But

828
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
He did

829
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Contribute to what

830
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,232
Get behind that is probably given Ted Nugent covid

831
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
That is good

832
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Not all heroes wear capes

833
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,400
And better than ever

834
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,704
You still Rambles a lot okay

835
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
I could

836
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,968
Oh my God just died

837
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,808
Toothpick

838
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Sounds like

839
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
He always sounds like he's on coke

840
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:03,840
Quick talks all the time about how sober is annoying

841
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:09,216
A lot of this appearance on the

842
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
The show is about how

843
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
Excited Ted

844
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,152
That people celebrated him getting covid because

845
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Validate

846
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
The people are against him

847
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,016
And I would say

848
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
Just because he's been a dick for a really long time and no one like

849
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
But some of my other musician friends from around the

850
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Journalistic

851
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Die

852
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
I feel the love I celebrate the love

853
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
But do you realize

854
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
As I think I am

855
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
I could

856
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
Wonderful human being

857
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
I hate

858
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
Celebrating my sickness and suffering

859
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
Is proof that they're scared

860
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,376
Makes me so happy

861
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
That's cute

862
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
No no one is scared

863
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,824
The death of you we were all just kind of hoping you'd finally go away

864
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,664
I do think there's something probably unhealthy

865
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,736
About people being happy

866
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Singapore celebrating

867
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
Tragedy befall someone who is in the car

868
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,904
But I would be an idiot

869
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Do not think that

870
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
The reason is because Ted

871
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
F****** idiot

872
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
He's ready to rock around the clock like Spock or whatever the f***

873
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
This is all your fault

874
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
That's all his

875
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
Personally like that

876
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
That's the thing it's

877
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,895
It's not necessarily Sade

878
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
Android so much as it is

879
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,783
When somebody spend so long telling you that this thing isn't even

880
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
King real

881
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,087
And all of this s***

882
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
Everybody celebrating because

883
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
F******

884
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
Do you get it

885
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,815
You get it now I don't know it won't so that's why the only thing you have left

886
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
To do as we like

887
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,607
Well I guess I

888
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:19,007
Just hope he dies or goes away to laugh you know you laugh at Ted Nugent getting covid after going to a

889
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,823
It is a hoax grocery store and having a hole

890
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,687
Long. Of time where you yelling about an hour it's not that bad it's all

891
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,527
Wow. It's in the same way that like you laugh when Ted Nugent

892
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
Bans guns it in France

893
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Kind of like

894
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Interesting it's a physical real world example of the you know me reaping verse

895
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Versus Me sewing meme

896
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
You know like that

897
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,423
Interesting metaphor

898
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,959
Confused by I want to see if you can make

899
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,287
Consider myself a Schindler

900
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
And I already came

901
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
Is growing so

902
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,991
And they're all white

903
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
Hate

904
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,343
Everything I stand for

905
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,879
Viewers will understand

906
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
But some people will

907
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,559
Tubi

908
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
To be

909
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
So

910
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,423
I do think

911
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,983
He's right that some people will get that metaphor

912
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Confuse

913
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
Even when he's trying to explain it

914
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Yeah

915
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
That's what he's talking about and it the way you

916
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
Explaining that excuse

917
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,063
Oskar Schindler

918
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,367
Saving Jews who's on

919
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,695
What is T mean does he have a physical list of

920
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
People that

921
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
He's acting

922
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,791
Sing like Schindler about or is it just that

923
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
The brownshirts don't like him

924
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,375
Based on what

925
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,215
Describing like being productive

926
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,263
The only way that that really helps

927
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,079
Other people is by example I guess

928
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Sure

929
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,783
I don't know I don't understand but now I don't understand that metaphor

930
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Anyone

931
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:14,207
And I see him stealing the Valor of an actual hero in order to

932
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,487
You prop himself up

933
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
And boost his

934
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Easy going

935
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
It was offensive

936
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Various

937
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,423
So there's a solution to the problems in the world

938
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,447
And of course I've gone

939
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
But there's another solution

940
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
Ted Nugent

941
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
Atmore Alex

942
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
What do we do when the country's awake

943
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,919
But they stole the election

944
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Call Alex

945
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,319
We need more out

946
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
You put there

947
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
Literally there

948
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,999
Metastasized into every orifice

949
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,839
Every every element of America the media our government

950
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
Hollywood

951
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Academia

952
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
It's literally

953
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Marxist

954
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
More often than not

955
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
They're little

956
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
Rock Solid in the skin

957
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Calling if you look

958
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,407
What they're doing

959
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:09,247
That the economy is all artificial

960
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Orange futures

961
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Babies to produce

962
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,583
The most important thing is to support the Alex Jones

963
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,775
With all due respect

964
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,311
Wrong

965
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
Breath

966
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,831
So there's something

967
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
It stuck out to me when I was

968
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,391
Hearing that and it's just

969
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,927
He's angry

970
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
Yeah he's really really really angry

971
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,327
He's trying to come off with this laughing like I'm just

972
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
But he's f******

973
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
So mad

974
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
There is there is an affect

975
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Rage

976
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
Underneath everything that he saying

977
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
That is really unsettling

978
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,711
Yeah yeah he's a he's a real psycho it's a real psychopath kind of thing to do feels

979
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
Feels

980
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
Scary Jon Ronson and see what he has

981
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
To say about the psychopath test

982
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
I just love

983
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
I just love to go from one

984
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Clip where he died

985
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Describes himself as Schindler

986
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,559
And then to the next clip where he describes

987
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
His political enemies the same way the Nazis

988
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Describe the g

989
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:36,031
Boy it's not flaring

990
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
To do

991
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,919
Awkward weird word is not the word I would use

992
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:46,015
Oh nothing he's now one of describe themselves as the Jews

993
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,087
Despite the fact that they are still trying to exterminate

994
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Weird

995
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
So

996
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
They have

997
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,023
They have some commonalities

998
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Some less

999
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,095
Complementary than others

1000
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,935
One of them is a little bit maybe neutral

1001
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
Is an interest in the outdoors

1002
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
In hunting

1003
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,311
Alex believes that the most of

1004
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Effective way to can

1005
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:10,847
Convert liberal

1006
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
Over to their side

1007
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
Ted Nugent says something

1008
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
That I find

1009
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Problem

1010
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,111
Getting back to honey I found with leftist and liberal to take a lot of Hollywood people out over the years

1011
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,671
Mike Judge

1012
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,743
They convert the shooting hunting instantly

1013
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:32,607
Don't know why they were taught to hate it

1014
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
Is if you can get a bunny or fishing

1015
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Where they've been brainwashed

1016
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,359
Between

1017
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
The brain-dead

1018
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
The man in the woman

1019
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
What

1020
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
Thousands of people

1021
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,719
Animal racing

1022
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
It's called

1023
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Venison

1024
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,239
I don't know if he actually has a camp for kids but if he does I'm going to guess he

1025
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
She's not all that Hands-On I should hope

1026
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
That should be illegal

1027
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
But I think

1028
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Just from

1029
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
From like a

1030
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Umbrella hangout from that clip

1031
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,575
Believes that animals don't have right

1032
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,415
Anything that is an animal is subject to

1033
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
Man's domain / 3

1034
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
He's a dominionist

1035
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
I think that there's there's a

1036
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,303
An interesting

1037
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,351
Argument to be had that

1038
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,887
Animals have more rights

1039
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
Then we ascribed

1040
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
Right

1041
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,239
I think I cuz I have less agents

1042
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,263
I am not

1043
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,311
Fully

1044
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Conversant on some of the arguments

1045
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
In favor of vegetarianism

1046
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,175
Veganism

1047
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,711
But I think that there are cement

1048
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
Interesting things

1049
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,295
They can't be discussed along those lines

1050
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:58,623
Right and I just look at it as like I I

1051
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
Live with a cat

1052
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Salinas

1053
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
Like a friend

1054
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,511
I believe that she has many right

1055
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Now

1056
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,583
If I were Ted Nugent

1057
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,887
I should only be mad if

1058
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,911
You killed

1059
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
Celine

1060
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,471
Because she was my property

1061
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:17,823
The only thing there is a property right that's been violated as opposed to

1062
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
Something really f***** up you taking the like

1063
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Life of this

1064
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
This

1065
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
Companion Animal

1066
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
That also mean

1067
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,783
Oh is that you have the right to

1068
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,063
Kill Ted Nugent

1069
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
If he attacks

1070
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
Text Selene in anyway

1071
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,647
Because property rights

1072
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
R a c

1073
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,255
I'm interested in strange 22 imagine

1074
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Dude weight

1075
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
He would distinguish

1076
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Humans and animals

1077
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,119
In terms of where do rights

1078
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Begin

1079
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
I think it's really troubling

1080
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
REI

1081
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,615
I think you could go too far with it maybe I would say that if you think

1082
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
Animals have no rights

1083
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:56,735
You are probably of the opinion that

1084
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
Many people are also animals

1085
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
2 don't have a ride

1086
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
For cockroaches exactly

1087
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,927
So I would not

1088
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Enjoy anybody who

1089
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
Who's like

1090
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
No rights

1091
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,327
And I think typically it's best to err on

1092
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
On the side of

1093
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,703
The importance of sensitive to me

1094
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
Stu

1095
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,007
Two animals

1096
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Communicate

1097
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
But they are clearly having a

1098
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
Like a conscious experience

1099
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
Absolutely there's no way that you can

1100
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
I have

1101
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
Not figured out that animals have personalities

1102
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
By now

1103
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
Pretty pretty messed up

1104
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Yeah

1105
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
Yatted

1106
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
There should be a restraining order keeping him away for

1107
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
From any children if somebody writes his songs

1108
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
That's an immediate restraining order away from jails choosing to believe that that was a metaphorical flourish like rock around the

1109
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,727
Clock with a sock on my head

1110
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Future glockbox

1111
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
Butter chicken

1112
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Anyway

1113
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,383
Alex

1114
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Get some out of there

1115
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Band

1116
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
Biggest news in the world

1117
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Which

1118
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:07,903
I mean he's that time do that already decided to talk to Alfie Oakes and Ted

1119
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,023
Ladies and gentlemen about to break

1120
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,863
The most important news in my 27 years on air

1121
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:26,591
This information is not

1122
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,175
If it does not reverse the operations that they've launched

1123
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,039
Then things are going to get a lot darker

1124
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
Let me give you a

1125
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
Alex is something like

1126
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,743
If this doesn't bring down the globalists things are going to get dark fast

1127
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
It's essentially saying

1128
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,863
I can't make up anything more Sensational are antagonizing than this

1129
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:49,887
Bike

1130
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:52,447
The Next Step from this is me telling you to kill p

1131
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,519
I can't make it more clear

1132
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
I already know this

1133
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
Sympatex

1134
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:02,431
So you guys better clean my actual meaning from this

1135
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,479
Because I'm making it very obvious

1136
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,367
Emergency alerts ouchi project manager confesses

1137
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:18,303
Tucker Carlson began to break this last night I told you on the war room we be bringing it today

1138
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
He broke it

1139
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
That's right

1140
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
But he didn't

1141
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
Get to the last part

1142
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Where he admits the project manager

1143
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
Because legally they couldn't

1144
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:32,639
Get to that box so I get the five irises if they combine them for a vaccine

1145
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
Vaccine

1146
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
Pathogen

1147
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,015
That no one would ever make

1148
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
Yeah it's not the end

1149
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,927
So as I was really funny because he's talking about Tucker's

1150
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
Segment

1151
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:53,375
While he's talking Alex is kind of being a little wishy-washy about whether or not Tucker segments being censored

1152
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,167
And I think it is this like

1153
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Alright

1154
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
I'm posting

00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,175
A good reason why that okay

1158
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Something

Why isn't there a criminal investigation

1178
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
Listen to Country Inn in the sub-headline

1179
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
You explained

1180
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,127

Alright 100%

1183
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:27,839
Ends up talking a little bit about the story about the interview on

1184
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
This week in virology

1185
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
Haha it's just this

1186
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Is tragic

1187
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
Cheater

1188
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
Ecohealth Alliance starting in 14

1189
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,783
Project Lead on 6th

1190
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,087
We focus on the emergence of novel

1191
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
Zoonotic

1192
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Coronavirus cases

1193
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Covid

1194
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,791
Curology

1195
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,863
I'm going to show you sit him saying

1196
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,167
I was just stumbling over everything

1197
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,239
Yeah that's not an hour-long interview

1198
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,799
Is not good just everything is is just

1199
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,127
It's by the rules of rounding up your going to Ford

1200
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,759
But it's just covered in slime or something

1201
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
No it is very much like

1202
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
He doesn't understand

1203
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
At all what he's talking about

1204
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,183
And so they're just like

1205
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:29,023
We don't have much else on the show today clearly all we could get it

1206
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
Is f****** Alfie and

1207
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
Disgusting Ted Nugent

1208
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,423
So f*** it

1209
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Let's are Tucker stuff and I'll just kind of rip through it

1210
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,823
I got like really oversell it

1211
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,127
So you talked a little bit more about some details

1212
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
It's and it's

1213
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Again not that

1214
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Accurate

1215
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,295
3748000

1216
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,575
$15

1217
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
Is the head of

1218
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,255
And we got all the doll that right here

1219
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
Balancing reading some information here he doesn't really

1220
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:10,239
The amount that he's talking about that 3 million plus dollars at Alliance has received

1221
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
2014

1222
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,871
From the niaid for Coronavirus

1223
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,175
Spurred on by the SARS and MERS outbreaks

1224
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
And the need to prepare

1225
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
What are the findings of his research was funded by the number of

1226
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
Pornstars like Coronavirus

1227
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
An interesting Lee they also found quote

1228
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
Serological evidence of

1229
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
Human exposure among people living nearby

1230
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,863
This is something that ends in the direction of the natural origin

1231
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
Jim theory for SARS coronavirus 2

1232
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:45,567
People who researching naturally-occurring coronavirus is it found a number of them and discovered evidence of previous spillover

1233
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Viruses

1234
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
Did it previously gone unnoticed

1235
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,711
It's a particular virus have been different if any of those cases or

1236
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,295
Something has gone slightly differently people had interacted differently

1237
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,623
Those instances could have been the start of an outbreak

1238
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,951
Alex's main piece of evidence he's resenting here these

1239
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
These are grants in this study

1240
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,303
It actually makes me think the opposite

1241
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
What is conclusion is

1242
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
I'm I'm Blown Away

1243
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,447
Like this is this goes back to that hot

1244
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,775
Possible that's goes back to the covid payments for Medicare where it's like

1245
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,079
16 Grand Lake

1246
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
I'm blown away that you think

1247
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
You can make me worried about it

1248
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,711
Conspiracy theory where it's like

1249
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
It cost

1250
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
The globalist

1251
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Send the devil 3 million

1252
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Kill

1253
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,855
Everyone on Earth

1254
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:34,719
If that's how much it cost to kill us why do I have to deal with all these f****** billionaire

1255
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:38,047
Don't kill me with a few million

1256
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
Yeah

1257
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,095
Yeah yeah

1258
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
It's

1259
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
I don't know

1260
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,239
It's that it's a part of your brain that just doesn't

1261
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
You know $3000000 is a whole lot of money

1262
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Terms of a research grant that was over the course of 2014 to 24 years

1263
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,183
That it's not that much research actually cost

1264
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,231
Yeah absolutely I mean for a bit

1265
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,327
Is if you want to say if you want to say that a conspiracy theory about this

1266
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Is a huge deal

1267
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
Over 7 years

1268
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,703
A business would probably be

1269
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:21,055
Disappointed with revenues if they were only at that amount now

1270
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
Scooby-Doo

1271
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:28,479
Areas with revenues if you didn't get a 3 million in 5 years 7 years or whatever

1272
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,295
Myself incredibly on inspired by

1273
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
What is conspiracy

1274
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Inspired by

1275
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
What you heard before

1276
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,927
But I got to thinking about it a little more

1277
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,559
I want you to help me write a new album

1278
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,607
With songs like four horsemen

1279
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,447
My car in Austin I said dude

1280
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
This is very surreal day we've had dinner with Willie Nelson

1281
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,311
Said

1282
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
I said

1283
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,407
I think that's up to you to write that

1284
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
So

1285
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
What a great story

1286
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
Par with I was walking down on New York City Avenue and I saw

1287
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,511
And I was like amen and he was like a

1288
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,839
Dave Mustaine was really drunk around me one time

1289
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,375
It's the same story

1290
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,399
That sucks

1291
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,751
I'm kind of disappointed because

1292
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,847
It sounds kind of like Alex is trying to claim

1293
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,687
That Dave Mustaine wanted him to help life so wrong

1294
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:37,087
Text Alex Smith songwriter wanted to help write songs that would be on the album

1295
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,135
Ourisman on it and that was Kill Em All

1296
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,951
By Metallica

1297
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,023
I wish that was what he was actually climbing

1298
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,839
You to help me write songs are like that

1299
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,911
Let's go to Burrito

1300
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
Yeah I can imagine

1301
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:58,335
I can't imagine anybody

1302
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,871
I want you

1303
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
In an enclosed space with me

1304
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,711
Writing song

1305
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,575
Songs to Galax allergy basically the Jim Steinman of your generation

1306
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:13,439
I need you to bring this

1307
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,535
Get get Taylor Swift's producers out here get those swedes

1308
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,863
Get the Matrix

1309
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,191
Dream would you need them for Alex's next album

1310
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:30,847
So I think we've been talking a little bit along the way through this episode this just feels like Alex doesn't have anything to grab

1311
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
50 feels really

1312
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,711
Conspiracy

1313
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,551
Two-and-a-half minutes of Alex saying nothing

1314
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,319
Kind of

1315
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,879
Dancing around but he doesn't know anything

1316
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Totally Tan today

1317
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
This is

1318
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
Hands down

1319
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
Biggest

1320
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Trap of Awakened

1321
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,863
The biggest haul of Truth

1322
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,423
Moon do the globalist the biggest

1323
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,983
Opportunity

1324
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,079
Killer Joe

1325
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
I mean

1326
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,687
The Dominoes start falling in trials

1327
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
I mean there's going to be

1328
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,759
People getting hung

1329
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Sure

1330
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,831
That's what happens

1331
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,391
Did you get marked up there they pull the switch

1332
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,071
And you like start kicking you take a

1333
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
What

1334
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,167
Killing people

1335
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,215
How do I start a fight with murderers

1336
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
But they start a fight with us

1337
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
And

1338
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
I'm just telling you like I said the first hour

1339
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,919
Ouchie or Bill Gates

1340
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
For the New World Order

1341
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Provision language

1342
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,255
We want to see them up on Nuremberg to

1343
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
Last weekend I had that weekend before last I had

1344
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
The guys are hyenas still

1345
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
What

1346
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
Shopping because

1347
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
I will not be at

1348
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
Coward to say God

1349
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,111
For your prayers listeners and I want to thank God for

1350
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
By taking action

1351
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
This is

1352
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
Devastating

1353
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
Devastating

1354
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
Devastator

1355
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
There's no way to describe how much trouble they're in

1356
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
And I can tell you this

1357
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,287
They're never going to get out of this

1358
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
One way or another

1359
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,431
This is a political deathblow

1360
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,807
Bolsonaro

1361
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,855
Boris Johnson who's a follower

1362
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,231
They want this too small economy

1363
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
Working people

1364
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,839
Global banks in big box or take over with big Tech

1365
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
Anything to do with any of the bombshell stories it's just rambling and

1366
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
Think about nothing

1367
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Assuming the conclusion is already been made

1368
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
Time-filler

1369
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Yeah

1370
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,135
That's brutal

1371
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
That's brutal also if

1372
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,231
Alex says Megalodon

1373
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,023
He called somebody a megalomaniac

1374
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,839
And doesn't say it takes one to know one

1375
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,375
That it's disqualify

1376
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
It doesn't count

1377
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
If you do say takes one to know one

1378
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:39,263
Maybe I'll listen to you because you are a

1379
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Absolutely one

1380
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:41,823
Ham

1381
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,871
But I think I think what's going on

1382
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
Generally

1383
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:49,503
Is it out he's already spent those

1384
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,855
Rambling about you no lie

1385
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,135
Like to talk to you will hang

1386
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,951
And I always all proving it

1387
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,559
Because I think what's really interesting to the audience isn't really the nitty gritty

1388
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,607
Details or anything like that

1389
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
It's an emotional experience

1390
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,239
Announces giving them an emotional experience and that is it

1391
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
This Is the End

1392
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,103
Heels are bad whenever we want

1393
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,199
There's no way they're going to get out of this

1394
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
Is there in trouble

1395
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,271
I don't know the Duke boys tent

1396
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Needed to get out of

1397
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,575
Not the globalist

1398
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
This is a big deal

1399
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,207
That I have never felt so much fulfillment

1400
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
The marbles reward Humanity

1401
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,727
I've been around 47 years and I have never

1402
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,079
Never felt so much satisfaction in my life

1403
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:51,199
I was getting my ass absolutely

1404
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Dug down deep

1405
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Turn on the

1406
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
Turn on the

1407
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Ben g h a

1408
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
You know

1409
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
But that guy's jaw it's all he's had it

1410
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,047
Who won the fight

1411
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,351
Feeling of dissatisfaction

1412
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,215
Turn it on

1413
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
Add

1414
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:21,407
Risking my life you risking your life everything we've done together man this satisfaction right now

1415
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,023
Retribution

1416
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,607
Salix is basically like on this

1417
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,631
Tipperary's like

1418
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,215
Nuremberg trials will start in June

1419
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,335
But planning them and getting like a twitch stream ready for the Nuremberg trials

1420
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,919
Yeah this really does seem like a army building

1421
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,527
It's giving the good news of the the victory

1422
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:05,439
We have won the globalists are done now that this video from a year ago is Ben

1423
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Talked about

1424
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
That doesn't sound

1425
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
True to me

1426
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,167
No it doesn't know that's the emotional experience that Alex is wishing to create because

1427
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
You got nothing else

1428
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,055
Yeah I've got nothing else doesn't really lend itself all that well to like

1429
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
Be very scared

1430
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Yeah

1431
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:28,223
It is interesting the felt like there is a ratio

1432
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Tween

1433
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,295
Emotional manipulation

1434
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,343
And actual details

1435
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,391
Right-wing people

1436
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:39,743
Because they made you can't just give them information that that that doesn't work

1437
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,535
Do you have to have emotional manipulation

1438
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,119
And you can't let information get in the way of that emotional manipulation

1439
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,399
But you also can't have

1440
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Nothing

1441
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Like this is

1442
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,983
It's a lot of nothing

1443
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
Yeah

1444
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
It's a it was

1445
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,871
Infuriating to listen to in the in the sense that it was

1446
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
Kind of like

1447
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,015
I would describe it as being like eating a cinnamon twist

1448
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
From Taco Bell but without any of the flavor

1449
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
I was about to say empty

1450
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,879
Tea calories

1451
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,463
Exact no cinnamon sugar on it but it's

1452
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
Texture of what you were supposed to eat but there's nothing

1453
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,911
Nothing to it it's just music yeah yeah yeah

1454
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
He does get

1455
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Excited

1456
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:27,615
Middle-aged my studies to look into Whenever there is something like the sparse document tool

1457
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
Look into

1458
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,199
I find this to be a little bit

1459
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,783
Unsatisfying personally

1460
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
I don't think

1461
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:41,439
That Alex is quarterly job evaluation is going

1462
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
To go well

1463
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
Just not just for my

1464
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:48,351
Perspective having information about how the boss fee

1465
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,679
Which is Springsteen of course

1466
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,727
Q3 is going to be rough

1467
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Terrible

1468
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Don't have to get his numbers

1469
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,383
If you want a sense of how real a piece of news is Dalek

1470
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
I think one of the things you should take

1471
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:06,783
Stock of is how much of the time of the shows actually spent

1472
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,599
Talkin about that bombshell

1473
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:12,671
Is this such a bombshell that you don't go away

1474
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
And talk to alvie Oaks

1475
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
Send Ted Nugent

1476
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
Forever

1477
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,559
Bombshells at you.

1478
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,679
I don't know spend the end of your show just talking about nothing

1479
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
And then

1480
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
Cover this for a little while

1481
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:31,871
Play short clips

1482
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,663
Steve Bannon

1483
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
Steve Bannon and Rodger Stone of a fights

1484
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,087
Anybody

1485
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Smart guy

1486
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
But he

1487
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,951
Costco has

1488
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
Meditating about Alex Jones

1489
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,279
It's crazy

1490
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
That's how it is

1491
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
When you're headed

1492
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,471
Your time

1493
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,287
It's about people realizing that we don't make

1494
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,847
The stuff up mostly research

1495
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,919
And we have a wide spectrum understanding of the world

1496
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
Say a thing

1497
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,623
We really study how the globalist operate him and we know how they do things we know how to counter them

1498
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,415
And we know how to beat them

1499
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
Everything should be about the globalist

1500
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
Because they're the ones that control of civilization

1501
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Take us to a very bad place

1502
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
And so that's what I'm getting at here

1503
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,495
But it is good to see it Trend yesterday Alex Jones Ford it on Twitter again

1504
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
But I'll shows with ripe

1505
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,823
And you can just

1506
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,247
Sure so it's a little bit of Alex Jones

1507
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,039
Media attention get some

1508
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,319
Get some coverage here

1509
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:47,135
Hi I just feel like he's such an insecure dick

1510
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,951
It's so sad like

1511
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
How many times has

1512
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
Have we heard him talk about hating Steve Bannon he's a f****** world

1513
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,727
He's gone to the global team

1514
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,055
So pissed off when Steve Bannon neighborhood show

1515
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
Attack on impulse

1516
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:12,991
To take away all their real smart guy because it said something nice about me and let's spend a minute

1517
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,783
About how someone said something about me

1518
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,343
What an a******

1519
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Not hard

1520
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
Today

1521
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:26,047
You are a bad guy in Scream that everybody should kill him

1522
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:30,399
He said I was the bad guy Zoe

1523
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
He gets

1524
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,703
Have you ever seen

1525
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,519
Bill bars basically secret Tucker

1526
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,591
Have you ever seen like

1527
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,127
Breaking news story

1528
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,687
Or a bombshell report

1529
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:49,087
And then all the news organizations who normally have like live blogs and there's constant media coverage

1530
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879
Just kind of stopped and they're like

1531
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
Can we just ramble around a little bit

1532
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,463
We just got to have a little fun

1533
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,863
You know bombshell story is fine but you know I'm just going to talk a little s*** with my buddy over here at Wolf Blitzer

1534
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,679
Derails the show Situation Room

1535
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,239
For a while because someone tweeted about it

1536
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,287
Bright

1537
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,079
Filters just Alvin like

1538
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,383
Hey guys you know I'm at Willie Nelson

Pretty good songwriter

1541
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:24,927
Brian stelter is like one time

1542
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,487
Bob cowboy

1543
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,071
Even closer analog

1544
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,935
Imagine Brian stelter taking time to yell about Alex Jones is a.

1545
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
Totally

1546
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,007
So sad

1547
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,311
Frat Alex's necklace

1548
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591

1549
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,383

1551
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,991
So it's not been done

1552
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
Alex

1553
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,063
Doubles down on not doing it

1554
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
All right folks

1555
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,159
I'm at the tank call say I didn't

1556
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
Launch coming up

1557
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,999
I got a lot to hit before the show's over in 22 minutes

1558
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,303
What gas is over

1559
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
Let me do this because it's

1560
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,983
No man's land first five

1561
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
As our butt

1562
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
This is really in a

1563
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Report

1564
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,639
Playing a special report for the second time in this show

1565
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,711
Replaying a special report

1566
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,295
That's how little he cares about the story that he's cover

1567
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
This is

1568
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
This is kind of amazing

1569
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
This is a

1570
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,415
Complete abdication of

1571
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
Annie

1572
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,719
Even pretensive work

1573
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,815
Yeah yeah yeah 33 every indication is like I don't know enough

1574
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Too competent

1575
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
We even Riff on this

1576
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,519
Yeah but I do want to cover it because covered it last night and I'll be way behind if I wait until tomorrow

1577
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,847
This is the b******* that you get from a shity boss

1578
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:53,247
Swear he's always any mistake you make like perhaps not being able to figure out how the phone system works

1579
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
For twenty years

1580
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
He's always screaming at you

1581
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,927
But then whenever he comes to work with this b******* you don't get to yell back at him that he's waste

1582
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,463
Thing everybody's f****** time

1583
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,535
Somebody should have like a button where they get to scrape

1584
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,167
Fair

1585
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,007
Alex spends more time talking about the pipeline

1586
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,591
I want to remind you that he's always right

1587
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Is very strong

1588
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,295
95% chance

1589
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
Watch out.

1590
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,439
5% chance somebody got pissed they shut down Keystone inside

1591
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
It's doing that Peshawar by the

1592
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,047
What is my percentage of globalist

1593
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,839
Percent chance that I'm wrong

1594
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,887
It was done by people pissed off

1595
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:42,911
Weather

1596
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,055
Logical world you do that and then if you'll understand but no

1597
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
Yeah so wait what

1598
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,919
95% chance globalist false flag

1599
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,783
5% chance false-flag carried out by people

1600
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Okay

1601
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:03,647
So the channel false why

1602
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,695
Look 0% chance it was hacker

1603
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:08,767
The Logical it illogical world

1604
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,095
Naturally somebody on the inside would be

1605
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:15,167
Furious about people shutting down the Keystone Pipeline

1606
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:21,567
So it only makes sense that they would then shut down a different pipeline isn't in order to the lesson

1607
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:26,175
Be careful what you wish for that's exactly what we'll do.

1608
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,223
That would be technically terrorism

1609
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:32,575
Text structure

1610
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,903
To spread fear

1611
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,255
Yeah I think it I think it's interesting to see the way that Alex's brain kind of like

1612
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,535
Comes up with possibility

1613
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,071
Yeah he's just a terrorist

1614
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:48,959
Anything that has to be fake every to ask to be traded kind of fake is it

1615
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Thirsty

1616
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
So Alex is a ranting

1617
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,615
Cuz I get just Valentine

1618
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,919
The left want to be homeless

1619
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,207
It's a happy thing

1620
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
That's how all this crap works ladies and gentlemen

1621
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,423
Or on and on and on

1622
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
And on and on

1623
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:27,103
And on from there I just hit my wireless headset audio off and I forget out at work

1624
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,639
Oh my God

1625
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Somebody somebody

1626
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,735
Acrophobia

1627
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,551
Punch it up where it works thank you so much

1628
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
Somebody screaming

1629
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,719
It's right

1630
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,255
What is a gentleman

1631
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,071
We are here fighting the New World Order

1632
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
It's hard

1633
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399

We bring you those products

1640

Relationship a360 win an Oscar

1641
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,959
Parasitic

1642
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
Until

1643
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287

Great deal

1645
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,919
And they told me the next two weeks or so

1646
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,343
Because the whole thing shutting down

1647
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,159
Because we're under braids

1648
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Wow

1649
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:51,327
Deceived you see the transition generally from like scary narrative into ad but then

1650
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,399
The ad leads into terrorizing the audio

1651
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
And of course that's that's

1652
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,519
Nice all this food for you at the prices good now but hey

1653
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:04,127
Tomorrow prices going to go to regular and actually I know that in two weeks prices are going up even more

1654
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:09,247
And also everything is going down because we're under attack at your food now or die listen

1655
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
All I'm saying

1656
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
Is that

1657
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,063
I am going to

1658
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,087

Stage with fear and then you will give me money

1660
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
And that's why you should be afraid

1661
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,535
Yep. Very very afraid

1662
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,863

01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
I've got

1667
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,479
So learn all the stuff is gone

1668
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,087
It's going to be like Road Warrior

1669
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
If we don't turn this around

1670
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
And there's not

1671
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
Much

1672
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Time left

1673
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
What's the shack

1674
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,255
Infowarsstore.com

1675
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
Funky Little Shack

1676
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:03,519
Look I am sick of tired of Schrodinger's Bug out location. So sick of it

1677
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,055
I don't care for this

1678
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:10,943
Nonsense of I have a compound or maybe I should make one for the world so dangerous

1679
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
The will-they-won't-they

1680
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Infuriating

1681
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:19,647
Together with Rachel Ross come on buddy also here's the thing that I want to bring a tent

1682
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,975
Abby and this episode Alex is talking

1683
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
About how we do

1684
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,767
Need to be really scared

1685
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,351
I'll buy that food got a Bug out location and all this

1686
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:34,751
Half an hour earlier he was laughing about how fulfilled he feels because the globalist are done for

1687
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,567
Thanks this bombshell that he can't quite get himself to

1688
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,615
Really cover it immediate absolutely

1689
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
That is

1690
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
Incongruent

1691
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
And the reason is

1692
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Because

1693
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
The emotional

1694
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
Experience of

1695
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,367
Defeating the globalist is something that he wants you to

1696
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
Yeah keep people having fun

1697
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,975
The money comes in

1698
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,791
Makes money off defeating the globalist

1699
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,583
It's terrorists

1700
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Yes

1701
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,935
I would like

1702
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
Some sort of

1703
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
Man

1704
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079
You just get caught up in that

1705
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
You know

1706
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:13,663
It just rewires your your ability to process

1707
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,687
If you're just so

1708
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,479
Emotionally overstimulated

1709
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
All the time with Nowak

1710
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,295
Actual release

1711
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,831
It just drives you insane

1712
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Like

1713
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,623
It's it's insane

1714
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:25,439
It's rate borderline solitary

1715
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,463
You know

1716
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Yeah

1717
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,255
Thoughtful

1718
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,791
Yeah I think I think that's

1719
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
Yeah I don't know what else

1720
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,631
Disabled

1721
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,167
It's kind of weird how you

1722
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
You can sell stuff

1723
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:42,335
Because that is not a weird aspect of biology is that somehow all the way along the line

1724
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,895
Find Evolution has led to the people being like

1725
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,687
Be afraid and bye-bye

1726
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,455
12

1727
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
I mean I think that's the American dream

1728
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:55,647
Snake oil salesman and what-have-you there is a certain American aspect of you.

1729
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:59,743
The way Alex is in a manipulating people in order to sell them bulshit

1730
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:05,887
It's hard not to think if we ever did eradicate these type of snake oil salesman that we wouldn't

1731
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Also have

1732
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
Like writers and and different people making nostalgic stories about snake oil

1733
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:17,152
Man going from town to town

1734
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,992
Regulate out of existence supposed to

1735
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:26,880
This is not a this is not a cockroach this survive

1736
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
10 Point of View Drive

1737
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,696
Bentonville feel nostalgic

1738
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,720
For the five-course

1739
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
Cuz we're insane

1740
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
Oh well

1741
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
Anyway I look forward to going back to

1742
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
The past because

1743
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
I find myself

1744
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,008
Incredibly frustrated by this a******

1745
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,056
And I don't want to hear about

1746
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,616
Another goddamn bombshell that's disappointing

1747
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
I want to go back to

1748
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
To the past when news was

1749
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
Measured

1750
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:57,088
Sometime guests wear combatives you are into everything was what it was

1751
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,672
Not this overly dramatic nonsense

1752
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,464
Every single

1753
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
It's just a birthday

1754
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
The candle is burned

1755
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,304
Going to Bright Now at

1756
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:16,800
