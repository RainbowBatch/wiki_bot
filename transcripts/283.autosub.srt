Which is great I love cats

10
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960

Alright well this is a lot about Alex Jones get away from this

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,672
The true irony of this is this is the only time I've ever seen you write down on your notepad before the show started

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,280
Coming up with a good question

25
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Fair enough oboy

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,776
Today we're going to be going over an episode episode

27
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
I need to get away from the Press

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Cuz that was

29
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Little bit too heavy

30
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
Need to give Alex

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
A little bit of time out time out

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
So today we're going back to 2013 to

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Continue our Sandy Hook

00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
Because the Friday and Sunday but no show on Saturday

37
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
People probably on Friday and asking hey Dad what about how Alex Jones

00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
Is LH podcast

39
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,224
We may cover some of it because of the timing of these episode 7 to record on Thursday

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Didn't have enough time to get into some of the

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
More recent releases

42
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856

Getting arrested

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
On Monday

46
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,032
Possible possible I don't know studio for Los Angeles

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
Genuinely have no idea

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
It could be bad

49
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
For Trump

50
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Quite frankly

51
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,016
Because our ideas

52
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
The Trump is supportive of

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,392
Extradite

54
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,208
That's really going to hurt Alex's

55
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Trump narrative

56
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,144
Well yeah I think it has the potential to really do real Alex

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Alliance

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
I don't know

60
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
It's pretty impressive

61
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Maybe that'll be

62
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
We'll find out

63
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
But for now

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112

If you're out there listening music

85
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,271
A sport that we could do that

86
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:17,695
I realize that with the screaming along with I renounce Jesus Christ

87
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Cord that comes out of your mouth

That's right golf clap voice

00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,087
It's going to get more annoying so Jordan like I said they were doing January 4th and 6th

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
Pretty clear that Sandy Hook is a false flag

93
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
But it's in the same

94
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
That the government did it

95
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
You still saying

96
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,375
You were killed and all that stuff

97
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
But the government went in

98
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
Killed Adam Lanza as a Patsy left them there

99
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
I all that stuff

100
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,615
But he doesn't really care all that much about it because he

101
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
She's now saying that the

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
The government in the globalist

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
Use that as well

104
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Start a civil war

105
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Pretty much

106
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Where we're at

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
As we jump in

108
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
On the 4th

109

He who laughs last

112
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
I don't know

113
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
Alex is really bad in play weird

114
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903

On the show

120
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823

00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Alex's opinion is bought it

126
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
About Russia

127
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,855
Weird shorts here's where it starts out all the episode naturally starts out on this team

128
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
So that's pretty yak

129
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
Yesterday

130
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
I was just

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,583
I was really hope specific

136
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607

Alexander hooks

145
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
It makes some sense for him to feel that way

146
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
If you go back and look over artsy America's videos from the era of 2010 to 2012

147
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
With Alex's friend

Announce himself

A frequent guest on the network

154
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
And the messages they propagate on the network are the

155
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Infowars

156
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Looking over this archive it.

157
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,735
Imagine a true Ally

158
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,831
Feeling cast aside what he feels like they aren't joining him

159
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
In this battle

160
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
Which is built up as being too thin to lie

161
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
To the end of American civilization

162
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
You could feel like

163
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
Possible just going to be a little bit of rejection there

164
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Guess

165
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,167
Absent

166
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Weirdo

167
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
It does

168
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,871
What emotional trigger could be

169
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Be there

170
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
Possible

171
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Arteaga's

172

Start with a little less paranoia

175
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
On December 4th

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
The day of the shoot

177
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607

00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
Worked at the school and was fired

182
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
This morning one of the victims was his mother who was a kindergarten teacher

183
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
And shot open fire on the kids in the classroom

184
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
Not implying at the Mothership

185
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
None of that is true

186
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Adam Lanza

187
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
School kindergarten

188
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535

Exorcist

191
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
She didn't have to work

192
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Because my brother-in-law left her very well off

193
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Very well

194
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
To which she replied

195
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Marsha Marsha Marsha

196
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
She's doing really well if

197
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Sister had to repeat

198
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Very well-off twice

199
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Chewbacca

200
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
From that divorce

201
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,927
The day of the shooting Artie was reporting outright Goss if it wasn't true at all about the

202
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
The tragedy

203
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Is not cool

204
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
Within a week however Liz wall started reporting on houses

205
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
Publicly or tweeted

206
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
The shooting

207
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,055
About the idea that it's possible

208
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Pointing out that in the 2012 election

209
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Over the over

210
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
10.5 million dollars

211
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
The NRA spend

212
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Only point

213
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
3% of that money actually went towards

214
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Outcome

215
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,647
Either support a candidate who won or opposing a candidate who lost

216
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
I don't know if that that's accurate as a statistic

217
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
But it's what you was reporting

218
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
Doesn't really mean much compared to

219
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Just there in

220
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
Message

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,943
Hey don't worry about these loud assholes their bark is worse than their progress

222
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,271
Don't worry about you

223
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
But that interpretation

224
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Moviefone

225
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
Decorative wood art

226
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
He was putting out

On December 19th rtamerica Aaron interview with Jim statue

228
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Statue

229
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,423
Control would be effective and it's tearing

230
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
Gym Issaquah

Parasites in Furman

237
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
Been burning a Mexican flag

238
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,343
He's posted videos where he literally Advocates shooting black lives matter protesters

239
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
In the back on site

Explains for the camera of bullet with BLM written

241
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
He posted a video of himself outside a mosque

Augusta Georgia

243
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
With a gun yelling

244
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Islam

245
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
He's literally told

246
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
His followers quote

247
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
If someone is a member of Auntie

248
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Tifa people

249
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Lone Wolf

250
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
And retaliate against the

251
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
This attack retaliate as a lone wolf

252
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
Before this appearance on rtu.

253
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,687
Multiple times

254
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
It was on the Southern Poverty Law Center's list

255
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Dangerous members of

256
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
The Patriot movie

257
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
Dudeism

258
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
And the Georgia civilian militia

259
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,231
As well as his deeply bigoted radio shows that tended toward

260
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Violence

261
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Artie had every reason to

262
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
This f****** nuts

263
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Case was

264
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Text via voice

265
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
December 18th

266
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Abby Martin

267
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
About how

268
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Analyzing and exploit

269
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
Entirely in his Express

270
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
RT correspondent

271
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Anastasia

272
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Lament

273
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
Tails wrong about the shooting

274
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
They're reporting

275
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Just kind of funny because the other guests on

276
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Does a new four days earlier said on our teeth

277
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
To work at the school

278
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
December 9th

279
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Authority interview.

280
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Good buddy Paul Craig Roberts

281
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
The government needs

282
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Steak

283
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
We bring in the police

284
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
At the end of the interview

285
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
Suggest a book may not have been real

286
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
These events whether real or not real

287
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Helpful

288
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Take away the guns

289
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Fat to take

290
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
Part of Americans

291
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
Have they also allowed dangerous

292
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,679
Crazy assholes to regurgitate

293
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
I suspected Alex Musk

294
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,663
The other kind of expressing like a lot of Americans are calling for gun control you just got really mad about

295
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Also

296
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
This is probably worth noting at this point

297
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
At this point in time

298
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Alton for the guests on Earth

299
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
May 2012

300
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
So you may just be feeling a little bit left out

301
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
This doesn't seem like

302
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
The kind of behavior that we saw from him

303
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,375
Recently with Joe Rogan

304
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
You deserve in wasn't getting

305
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,543
This seems to have worked out in this case just as well as it did with Rogan

306
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Alex

307
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Duarte

308
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
All his buddies Max Keiser

309
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
This isn't about geopolitics

310
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
It's not about gun rights

311
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
It's not even bad for you

312
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
It's 100% about Alex's

313
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
It's Ollie's Express

314
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Wait

315
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Super weird

316
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
Alex talks about how the globalist want Civil War

317
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
He knew that Sandy Hook

318
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Was going to happen before it

319
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:29,279
Call Alex

320
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Totally new

321
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
You you saying it's news

322
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Because he did

323
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Similar things of the past

324
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Specifically

325
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,975
Is all that serves to do is this

326
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Predictive markers were there in

327
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
It's the safest prediction

328
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
America

329
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Through

330
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,919
Early 2013 is probably a boulder prediction minute is now but still not vengeful

331
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Mayonnaise

332
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
It's like

333
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Playing his

334
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
His game of

335
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
No matter what happens

336
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
I have my

337
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Ass covered on it

338
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Like I predicted this

339
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
It's bake you know it

340
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
Comes out

341
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Something is wrong it's fake I told

342
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
See I told you it was a false

343
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
The matter what happens

344
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
He gets to say I

345
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Right right

346
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
He's cool that way

347
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,047
So at this point in the episode

348
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Is tramadol

349
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
Gunn weirdos

350
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
His show

351
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
To educate

352
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Laprade

353
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
French parallel

354
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Is back from America

355
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
F***** up just as a way of

356
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
Thinking because what they do is they take the memory of someone who died

357
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
In Sandy Hook

358
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
I've been trying to rewrite her ex

359
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
As being like what if she had a gun

360
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Wouldn't have been great

361
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
They're not doing

362
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
F*****-up gross

363
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
One Brave woman did

364
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,847
Victoria Soto

365
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,455
The presence of mind to Hideaway the kids and then sheets

366
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Was out at

367
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
If only she had an opportunity

368
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Kill a human being

369
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
Gross

370
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
That's really bad

371
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,775
It's pretty disrespectful to her memory and it's even more cowardly that they're like

372
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Couching it with like

373
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
What is Martin Luther

374
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
The King Junior

375
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Oh man okay could have turned around

376
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Shop-Vac bright

377
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:38,719
What is Lincoln hat

378
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,095
Yeah I needed for that

379
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,167
Just like look at

380
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,751
What's up good weirdo

381
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
So Alex

382
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Roast

383
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
She's trying to do

384
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,015
Pretty consistently throughout this entire.

385
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
You know it

386
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
Sort of focused a little bit on his position on Sandy Hook

387
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
For a couple days

388
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Just like this

389
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Used to

390
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Defend himself

391
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
This isn't crazy

392
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
For me to be going down these

393
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Is the idea that there are bills being introduced

394
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
In order to

395
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
2 take away people's guns

396
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,311
In order for this argument to work in any way

397
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
There have to be

398
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Lisa perception

399
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
These bills are credible threat

400
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
Your gun ownership

401
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
I mean like

402
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
If you know that there's no chance

403
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Things are going to pass

404
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
You don't really have a good foot

405
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Stand-on to

406
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Stoke fear

407
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
Right

408
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
I mean.

409
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Kind of a rational way to look at it

410
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
Ants that would be if you're not

411
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
If you get complacent

412
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
And you aren't

413
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Constantly fighting back

414
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
Pass without anybody

415
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
You know you think there's no way that I'm going to pass but if you don't

416
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Maybe they'll do it

417
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,175
Only three people voted for the Federer

418
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Alex is going to say that latest

419
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:11,647
But not my response to that not the Federal Reserve

420
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Fear about it as a fact

421
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
You're sort of impending

422
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
This is the end of the world is coming now it doesn't work

423
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
If you think like this is impotent b*******

424
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
You don't need to be worried about it but let's stay vigil

425
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
Work

426
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Propaganda doesn't work with ambivalence

427
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,103
That's why it's funny that even Larry Pratt noses

428
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
These bills are never going to

429
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
Either in the senate or the house

430
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Esperanza Rising

431
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Good luck

432
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
Get off my show I don't know

433
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
The opposite of Y

434
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
U2 word lie about Obama 3 million times

435
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,024
Come on

436
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,608
Absolutely

437
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
Think of that muscle powder

438
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Speaking of Obama

439
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
It turns out today

440
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
I believe

441
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
I believe

442
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
What I suggest

443
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
What episode is probably a large part of why

444
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Are bikes tension Russia

445
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Present

446
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Explanation

447
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
And the reason that I don't take it as

448
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
The really what's going on is

449
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Absolutely not

450
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Reality

451
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
It's just

452
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Yes you are

453
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
And they're going to merge

454
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
President

455
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
Completely crazy

456
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,568
A couple reasons one is it in 2012 that was when

457
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
To the presidency

458
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
January 23rd

459
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Year ago there were different policy

460
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Reset

461
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,744
Much different relationship

462
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
It was much more standoffish in

463
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
And hostel

464
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:31,840
And then you got it

465
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
Consider that in December 2012 that's when the magnitsky Act was with

466
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Like there was

467
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
It was not good

468
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Between Obama and Russia

469
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
It in the time. That Alex is talking about right now

470
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,296
Afford that much red paint to put all those cameras

471
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
It you put it on the new one

472
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,392
You don't need a retro

473
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
There was over Syria time

474
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Obama and Russia

475
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Did not

476
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
See eye-to-eye

477
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
The police

478
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,680
The idea that Alex

479
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Suggested means

480
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
To me that the truth is something else entirely

481
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Easiest explanation

482
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
Is that I'm not on OurTime not on RT

483
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Yeah

484
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Giving

485
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Nuanced coverage

486
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
Of the gun issue

487
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
And I thought they were on

488
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
And I'm f****** pissed off about it

489
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Yeah well also they have

490
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,464
Well that's part of the Pacific Lino's

491
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
June 1st

492
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
Clips

493
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,264
Isn't he also isn't he

494
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Possibly admitting that

495
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
The arm of the

496
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,968
Propaganda machine

497
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,808
No longer part of the episode that I just did

498
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Keep input

499
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
More than willing to

500
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Explain

501
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
And that is

502
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
50 size bed

503
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
Run media stop I don't care

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
I'm not

505
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,816
I'm not doing it where they

506
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,352
Or giving me a message

507
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
They're putting out my mess

508
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,192
Right so is he believes that

509
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Interacts with it I don't really

510
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,568
It is possible to go on

511
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,848
State-run media organization

512
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Not be

513
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Waterford

514
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,224
It's not his

515
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
Simplistic as

516
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,296
If you're on there you're a Putin

517
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Eeyore

518
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
I need that it doesn't

519
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,584
I don't know if you just have to connect

520
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
Operation has you on

521
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
There's a reason that they have

522
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,008
Have you putting out your message but that message aligns

523
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:53,152
Whatever their goals are attack given point in The Archives of Art

524
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
South River

525
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
It's crawling with

526
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Infowars gas

527
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
It also likes stage France

528
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Didn't interview with

529
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
Cedar did a couple enter

530
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
Talib kwali

531
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
You know there's a lot of people there

532
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Even if they are asked

533
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Because your beliefs

534
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Lineup

535
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
In Subway with a message

536
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
They want to put forth

537
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,168
That doesn't always mean

538
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,216
I'm not saying

539
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Sure I'm just I'm just saying that whenever he

540
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
He says specifically

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
I go on there

542
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
And save my own message

543
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
They don't control

544
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,688
Definitely leaving out the part of

545
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
There's a reason they're having me

546
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
Specific

547
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Alex

548
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,440
World in

549
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Early January

550
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Less than a month after the shooting

551
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,144
You can already tell that Alex is getting a little bit defense

552
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
About what

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
He's doing

554
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
But there's no real pushback

555
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
At least

556
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,360
Appearing on the show ya complaining about anybody saying

557
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
His callers are if anything's

558
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:16,864
Multiple shooters

559
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
It was helicopters

560
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Those are all misreporting

561
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,792
He is he's already

562
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Internalizing

563
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Some sort of crew

564
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,216
Using s*** sources

565
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,264
To tell the stories that he's telling

566
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
He's like no it's all the real mean.

567
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,688
Reported based on

568
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,552
Possibly the root of it was that Artie report if it could have come from other places

569
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
The idea that the shooter work

570
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,672
Yams like that around

571
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
And

572
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
When you realize that that's not

573
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
True

574
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,096
You don't need to be defensive about the idea that RT reported it

575
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,912
Irie reported it incorrectly sorry I got the

576
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
That wrong you don't have to

577
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
Alex

578
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
All he has to do is say

579
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
I initially got a bad report about this

580
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Turns out that's not

581
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
McKay's books

582
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Because he can't

583
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Let me know from the deposition in prison

584
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,904
Ask about this the helicopter in the guy in the woods

585
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
A video that he saw

586
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
The Backs this up

587
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,168
Misrepresent

588
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,216
If I had to guess it would be easy cops

589
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Sandalwood

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
And one of them was dressed differently than the others

591
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Running

592
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,592
Pure to be a

593
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
Is just something

594
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,968
But you probably could look at that video

595
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
You don't have to hit your pillow

596
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
That's not

597
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
People getting arrested

598
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
In the woods

599
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
You're wrong

600
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
They wouldn't be

601
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
That video.

602
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,256
But I think Alex knows that I video doesn't show

603
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
Professes but it does

604
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
Therefore

605
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Lesbian

606
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
That's what I was going off

607
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Everrich

608
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Anyting

609
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Is it cuz he

610
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
I don't know

611
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,664
Very

612
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Very few retraction

613
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
Burberry website

614
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
But I don't know I don't I don't

615
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,136
Experience

616
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Not very

617
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,976
Well I'm just saying cuz it seems

618
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
It doesn't surprise me at all that

619
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,304
Just doubled

620
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
He's already made

621
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
In the first

622
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,288
How could you possibly

623
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
I'm sorry I'm not

624
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,872
Use of

625
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,408
I'm justifying

626
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,248
And that also that is part of the just

627
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Station 4

628
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Him saying that they're doing

629
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
Get to take your guns

630
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
To be doing

631
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
As extreme

632
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Broadcast

633
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:23,744
She's doing

634
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
The underpinnings of

635
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
If they fall apart

636
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Then everything

637
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,288
Literally has to say okay guys

638
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Calm down

639
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,664
Yeah problem

640
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
It's stuff like

641
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
This

642
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
Wouldn't work so well

643
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
Feeling when you packages came in like a few days ago and

644
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
It's going I'm dumb.

645
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,144
Fighting weight fighting

646
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,176
Send a fax for Aaron.

647
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,784
Polymers Plus

648
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
Amazing

649
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Freedom

650
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Listening her show

651
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:51,552
And see how they did and I was amazed

652
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,464
Appointment

653
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,328
You really ought to

654
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
Infowars.com

655
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:25,600
Sony only times that I've heard him actually advertise for his multi-level marketing

656
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
You very rarely brings that out but

657
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
It's interesting

658
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
But he does he

659
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
Planted call that just suddenly happens to lead to a very detailed explanation

660
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,448
Infowars life and how you should become apartment

661
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,776
Getting this ml

662
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
Feeling like you should do more Market

663
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
Also in there that like

664
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,064
The way he's like we don't take Putin money like RT

665
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,672
It really makes you think that all of his

666
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Complaints about Russia all about art

667
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
Autobot RT there about how he's not on it anymore it really feels that way throughout this

668
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
Authoritarian government ilovemylife

669
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,056
Absolute

670
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,408
Buttholes

671
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,760
If you're not having me as a guest on RT I can't handle this whole Russia thing

672
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Sprite

673
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
It's been awhile

674
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
I've heard from a good friend

675
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Little while

676
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
And I'm thrilled to report

677
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
I don't know where

678
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:44,704
Is in Arkansas

679
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
No it's old man house phone

680
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,104
Household is bad

681
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
My town because

682
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
The reason he's calling in

683
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,760
Is Ben he needs to report to Alex

684
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,088
He had Frank call Diane.

685
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Georgia

686
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,864
Thank you Alex and thank you for having your great gift Gerald Celente on today I had something have

687
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,264
Happened yesterday that both of you will enjoy I called Dianne Feinstein's office in Washington DC and whatever Young

688
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,944
I said ask for the gun-control measure Miss Feinstein is introducing today

689
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,296
I said please give her my congratulations I had no idea

690
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,856
Dia she was a supporter of the fuhrer

691
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:39,232
I said I don't fitler did the same thing to his people in 1934

692
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,632
And then we saw what he did to his people after he does on them so I just wanted to give her a very hard

693
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
Congratulations for following her

694
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Her guide

695
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
The fewer

696
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,592
Good prank call

697
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,176
Love it

698
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,504
Annoyance

699
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Okay

700
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Right I like today

701
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
Within Alex's rhetoric

702
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Would be

703
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
He says

704
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,936
The guns have been taken from all countries except for like America

705
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Switzerland

706
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Or whatever you know

707
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,336
That's what he says is like everyone else is taking the gun

708
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
Why aren't there more

709
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
Is there still kind of a counterexample to the argument

710
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,488
Sciatic tyranny comes as soon as people take away the gun

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
The arguing

712
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,120
Yeah but look I don't want it besmirch old man house

713
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
Because it's nice to have him back

714
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,752
And I'm glad that he's like a crank yanker

715
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,312
He's like spoonie Luv up there on the phone

716
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,432
Congressional staffers

717
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,760
Like it like he called a bit before that got a female staff

718
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
I can't talk to you

719
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Right

720
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Love it

721
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
So this show kind of

722
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
I could say that about most of Alex

723
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
The shows

724
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,096
It's a whole lot going already out of the main

725
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,424
Yeah Overdrive

726
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Alex's next

727
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
After half hour

728
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
After the show is over

729
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
He just did

730
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Special Report

731
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
From David Knight

732
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Who is working

733
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
He's been there for a while

734
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
Albany

735
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
The report is about

736
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:45,440
But don't worry

737
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,992
Fourth turning

738
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
Disciples

739
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Book about

740
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,024
Episode

741
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,304
The theory of the fourth turning

742
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Starbucks

743
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
Written by amateur historians William straussen

744
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Neil Howe

745
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
The book argues that there are generational Cycles

746
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
History which repeat

747
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
A calendar year

748
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Repeat that

749
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
Predictable and always follow the same path

750
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,224
Each cycle lasts between 80 and 100 years

751
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
Is made up of four turning

752
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
So there's the high

753
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Which is a.

754
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Thrivent

755
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Individualism

756
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
Happier

757
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
Come under attack

758
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
From a new regime

759
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
New ideas

760
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
Values

761
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
There's the unraveling

762
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,472
The. We're individualism

763
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
Cell-free re-emerges

764
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Institutions

765
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
ZK giving way to these new values

766
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
That came about during the week

767
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
Then there's the Christ

768
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
The fourth term

769
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
The.

770
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
People with old values are

771
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
Replaced by this new system

772
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
That's kind of a chaotic

773
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
What time does usually

774
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:25,024
We don't have time to get into a critical analysis of this Theory here but suffice it to say many people who had

775
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,936
Explain how many historical events and figures don't fit into their hand

776
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
Indeed conception

777
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,752
There's a lot of stuff

778
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
That's life.

779
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Enough in there that fits their pattern

780
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
You could easily be like oh my God

781
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,760
There's a lot of people are pretty critical

782
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,344
One person is review of the theory is not as critical however

783
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
David Kiser Road in 220

784
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Sometime

785
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
Quotes

786
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Colleges or

787
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Disgusting the media

788
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Ministration

789
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
The former head of Breitbart

790
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Strategist

791
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
The White House

792
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,568
He's very familiar with stress

793
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
House. Crisis

794
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Has been sick

795
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,408
Do use it to achieve

796
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
For quite a while

797
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,040
I know this because Bannon interviewed both Neil Howe and my

798
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:22,368
Myself in 2009

799
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
About the ongoing Finance

800
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Crisis

801
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
I don't like to get all spun out I'll talk about us

802
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Steve Bannon

803
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,048
Supervillain tried to take over the world

804
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,144
Inspired by half-cooked pseudo historical prophecy books from the 90s

805
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,984
It's really super a

806
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,544
It is weird though just to say

807
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Steve bannon's worldview

808
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,224
Was also apart of David nights

809
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Worldview

810
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
But he was reporting on on Infowars

811
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
In 2013

812
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
That's really weird

813
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
I don't think

814
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
But it's weird

815
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Yeah

816
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
They were both

817
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
They both enjoyed that

818
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Dallmyd

819
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
Walking Panama still at break

820
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,120
And if he

821
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,008
What's it called

822
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
2009

823
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
Then it wouldn't

824
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Surprise me

825
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
From him it's not personal cops

826
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Contact with the IP

827
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Entirely possible

828
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
No

829
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
It isn't

830
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,464
Because like based on what does Kaiser's

831
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Reporting

832
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,072
There is an indication from his interaction

833
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,632
That the idea of

834
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Use to your advantage

835
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,520
Whenever there is like

836
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
The new regime of ideas

837
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,360
The old being replaced by the new

838
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
If you

839
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Finagle things

840
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Appropriately or

841
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Correctly

842
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,296
You're able to make sure that your ideas are the new ideas that are implemented

843
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
Never let a good crisis

844
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,744
ROM

845
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Rob that's right

846
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
Never let a good crisis go to waste

847
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
I don't know

848
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
I don't really care I just think it's

849
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
All over the place

850
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Still from the 4th

851
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,176
In overdrive

852
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,712
A caller

853
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
He says

854
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
If you want

855
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
By forcing

856
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
You get like a new regulations

857
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Laws for guns

858
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,024
Make sure that they also include something

859
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,072
In the bill to get rid of the Federal Reserve

860
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
Yeah I liked it also for poison pill Dan every one of their bills how about adding onto each one of these the gun

861
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
Put in there

862
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Flies

863
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
Yeah I don't I don't think I would want to be

864
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
That sounds difficult

865
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Yeah he's

866
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
Is that use on one

867
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,751
Drive time to let it all hang out

868
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,335
Maria Ines

869
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
Jewel-Osco down the street from a strata Marina

870
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,855
It appears that that's at the root of it

871
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
Lumping in art

872
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,511
With like China jackass co-star awful

873
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,071
Which we know isn't view that he's going to

874
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,351
Keep for long

875
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,959
Three weeks later he's going to be

876
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
Something so trivial

877
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,615
I don't know if it's at that point when he's allowed back on

878
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
Something

879
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
So I don't know

880
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:39,903
I'm not sure what

881
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,463
I was going to Slit its throat

882
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Yeah I mean it

883
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
It's just so

884
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
When you have

885
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,887
Something like that it makes whatever your

886
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,423
Professing the problem

887
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Variance

888
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
Operator

889
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,359
Caller is last one year from

890
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
On the 4th

891
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,431
Caller calls in

892
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
I want to talk about Adam Lanza

893
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Does Mom

894
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,807
Alex says something that's

895
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
It's in line with his progression

896
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
Hi Alex

897
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Alex a few things

898
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:21,375
How come there's been no real consequential journalistic wedding

899
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:27,775
Adam Lanza's mother I mean after all according to the Press you play the Central Podcast

900
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,783
I just got out of the publican

901
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
Descriptive

902
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:45,183
Is there a nail and I don't know I mean

903
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,231
You said he has proof but he could have

904
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Think about the Aurora shoot

905
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
Because just cuz

906
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
Contacts

907
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,399
Yeah yeah we have proof there's not

908
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
It's really hard to nail down proof

909
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,775
Selfless

910
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,711
I don't

911
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Who is based on

912
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
What's it called

913
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:18,719
It's script play the script script

914
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
But like

915
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,583
You saying that something is scripted does

916
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
Imply the present

917
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:31,007
Still it's not good enough to nail down that is in line with the progression

918
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,823
Where we know he's going to end up

919
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,615
So you can see that here already

920
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,151
I mean what are we

921
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,687
January 4th

922
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,039
Just less than a month after he's already a week

923
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
Or so before this

924
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,391
Suggested that Robbie Parker was an actor

925
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,719
Because of the way he presented a little press conference

926
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
And now you saying the whole thing

927
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Conscripted

928
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,047
So

929
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:56,863
Yeah

930
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
It's quick

931
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,519
He got it over

932
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
It happens

933
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,783
You think it would be exactly

934
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
I should tell you this

935
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,671
You get the caller

936
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,719
Who's bring up the idea that there is

937
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Pennsylvania

938
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
Who is like going to

939
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
Everybody would like

940
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Guns are free

941
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:41,151
You don't want to do that I know a lot of

942
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
But

943
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
He's about to give out this guy's phone number

944
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,903
Police phone number

945
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,767
And I was like no no no stop stop

946
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
He said it was hard to give it out

947
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,375
And even be on the show tomorrow don't worry about it looking

948
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,959
Advance Auto

949
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:11,359
And I would have lasted so we can but it's just

950
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,735
Call Kevin

951
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
But Alex

952
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Built it up on the road

953
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
There are

954
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
He's going to have the police chief on

955
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Bob and here is Alex

956
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
The beginning of the show

00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
Announcing

959
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,351
Tessler

960
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,647
And

961
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
Has-been nullification

962
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,127
Nullification short of secession

963
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,319
Systems

964
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,159
Whatever

965
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
The sheriff's do

966
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:34,559
Notification ideas

967
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Phuket

00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,911
Alex's unlock more counties to secede from the Union

969
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,983
Alex's highly-touted

970
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
This is an interesting

971
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
Catfish

972
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:52,735
The show is part of Alex's parade of gone weirdo

973
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:57,343
Your gun out of your law-abiding hands

974
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,903
Leaving out only the hardest core Criminal

975
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,927
Out there having

976
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,719
Oh man we can't have that

977
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
I should tell you that

978
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Two years probation

979
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,471
Turns out that on May 5th 2016

980
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
Kessler tried to buy a gun from Dunham's Sports location

981
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
Relied on his application

982
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
Ask yourself what you lied about

983
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:24,479
In response to a question of whether or not

984
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Charged with a crime

985
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,831
Carrying a possible prison sentence of more than one year

986
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,207
You said know what the answer is definitely yes

987
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
We're available

988
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,143
It should arrive in fresh in his mind.

989
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,215
December 20th

990
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,007
December 2015

991
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,103
Six months prior disorderly conduct

992
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Making terrorist threats harassment charges

993
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
Pushing a guy

994
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
S*** about his daughter

995
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
And telling him you better watch your back I know where you live

996
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,719
Which Kepler Then followed up with by continuing to send the guy harassing

997
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Yeah

998
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,839
I mean I think the

999
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,143
Just a really Hammer home that you know

1000
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,775
The charge was allegedly the result of a complaint filed by women who attempt

1001
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,823
How to deposit Kessler's Hopper on the road

1002
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Apparently

1003
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
He did not take kindly to

1004
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,199
From the republican-herald

1005
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:32,831
Kessler pulled alongside

1006
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Language recording

1007
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
To the criminal complaint

1008
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,767
What are you doing you're lucky my kids are here you know what would happen

1009
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
The woman said cancel the cancel

1010
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,703
But suddenly stopped

1011
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
Pulling out a firearm to show her

1012
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
According to the complaint

1013
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
The woman said she is

1014
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,383
Seriously harm or kill her

1015
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
Especially since he act

1016
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Did that way

1017
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,599
I'm not 100% sure how these cases ended up in court

1018
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,487
But it really doesn't matter they were pending when he tried to buy this gun absolutely lied on that application

1019
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
These outbursts occurred in 2015

1020
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,471
He was fired as gilberton police chief in September 2013

1021
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Everypost

1022
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:28,639
The videos on YouTube

1023
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,735
He is no longer the sheriff that we should call

1024
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:38,111
Because you

1025
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:40,159
And referring to a dummy that he was using a

1026
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
Speaker of the House

1027
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
Which one

1028
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
Pillows

1029
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,143
In one of the videos he says quote Democrats are the most

1030
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,983
Vile creatures in this country their vile

1031
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,799
I don't want to call them people because that's being too kind

1032
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
They're scum

1033
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
You go against

1034
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,711
Take me to Lithia transcript of modern-day Alex Jones quite frankly

1035
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,271
But these videos were so bad for business

1036
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,551
So embarrassing

1037
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,647
Even the oathkeeper stopped working with Kessler after Outlets began covering

1038
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,439
Using hot water with

1039
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
August 2013

1040
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,119
Can't clear you was probably going to get fired and called for a council meeting

1041
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
He took to Facebook at that point to try to rile up

1042
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
Baked Melissa folks

1043
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
And you know what

1044
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,591
German article New Republic

1045
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,919
Over 50 people including a few out-of-state militia

1046
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Members 1st call

1047
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:41,087
They set up what gun-control Advocate Michael moral of the Statewide group Keystone progress called a quick perimeter

1048
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Around the council

1049
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
The heavily-armed crowd clearly unnerved

1050
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
The few townspeople who showed up

1051
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,023
You know why there's not more residents

1052
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
The threat

1053
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
That's why

1054
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,839
Because they're afraid

1055
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,935
One lifelong resident told the high morning Valley morning call

1056
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,751
Call Dara Fraser going to have their Windows shot out

1057

Call Kessler.

1059
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,871

1060
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Stop In The Boro

1061
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,455
So you won't his wife won't even stop in town

1062
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,527
He's the only topping that's it

1063
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:19,487
Legitimately living in Wild West times and he's a black police

1064
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
David Carradine

1065
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,495

After 2020

1068
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
No more president

1069
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:48,415
Militia guys to set up a perimeter outside the council meeting

1070
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,207
People into like

1071
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,999
Don't fire that guy

1072
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:57,119
He does have a militia of his own to

1073
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,447
Michael Merrill from Keystone progress

1074
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
He told the Huffington Post

1075
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
I've been organizing for four decades

1076
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,359
I've faced klansman a klansman in Kentucky

1077
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
You tasted Bosnia

1078
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
A police demonstrator

1079
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,039
That night Gilbertson with more frightening than any of those

1080
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Situations

1081
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,415
Display Force didn't work in Casper was ultimately

1082
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,719
The biggest reason for his termination

1083
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,791
It turns out he was firing guns that belong to the burrow

1084
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,583
Is a videos

1085
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,935
R5

1086
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,495
Easier way

1087
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
Opponent

1088
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
Good we got it but

1089
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,687
All kinds of

1090
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,551
He unsuccessfully ran for Sheriff

1091
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,879
Airplane videos

1092
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,231
Production

1093
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
It's the worst horror movies with get out

1094
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
He had one other move up

1095
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Sleeve

1096
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
But that's going to have to wait

1097
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
It's a little bit later than

1098
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Miramonte

1099
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:11,359
Before he got himself fired on Alex's show the future

1100
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
He's about to step in all because he's

1101
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
Complete lunatic

1102
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:19,295
2011 shot himself in the hand while he was at a bar

1103
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,439
Happy Frackville recreational complex

1104
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:29,023
Would you like to young girl needed to get surgery to remove a BB from her leg

1105
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,351
Which might not be relevant except the guy who is

1106
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
F******

1107
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,215
Videos of shooting

1108
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Guns all over the place

1109
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,567
So what does that with a p we got it kind of makes

1110
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,383
Do you think maybe he's going to do it with Daddy.

1111
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,687
So he's coming up later the show

1112
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,063

Send.

1114
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
Said something in this

1115
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,511
Is

1116
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
And

1117
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
In fiscal year

1118
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
2011 going to your legs

1119
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
And

1120
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,479
Ambercare on air

1121
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:34,559
Talking about

1122
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,679
4000 real

1123
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,407
Cool

1124
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
Alex

1125
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,735
Suggested something like that

1126
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,759
Should be taken off the air

1127
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:59,647
He literally said that if I said the cat like people in gangs of being killed it doesn't matter

1128
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:06,047
If I said something that offensively

1129
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
About this like not a couple months

1130
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
Alex

1131
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Worse

1132
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
What Arabic

1133
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
I don't know you do that

1134
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
50/50 auto

1135
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Pretty bad

1136
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
He's alerted me

1137
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
He's read a lot of things

1138
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,903
Of things that you do

1139
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
History

1140
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Historical

1141
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,727
Thomas Jefferson

1142
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:51,359
So Alex is batting average

1143
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,431
With quote how much would you be willing to bet that's not a real quote

1144
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,015
He started saying the words

1145
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
Let me ask you this

1146
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,047
How much would you bet that it's not a real quote 100

1147
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,887
If you said everything I own congratulations on your net worth

1148
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,639
Thomas Jefferson Foundation has investigated that quote quote the people will not understand

1149
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
Importance of the Second Amendment

1150
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
Until it's too late

1151
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
Baton Rouge

1152
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
The Jefferson ever said

1153
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,111
They consulted all of his collected papers

1154
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
Correspondence

1155
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Insomnia

1156
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,463
What's the idea that it's such a

1157
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,511
It's such an awful stupid quote

1158
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Out of their way they're like

1159
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,655
Well maybe this time

1160
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:53,055
May have read something one of these obscure documents

1161
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
The Thomas

1162
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,663
What else are they doing

1163
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:01,503
Beer in any public forum until 2000

1164
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,807
7-minute appeared in a book called

1165
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
A revolution is coming

1166
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,415
Bigi name at Carson

1167
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
It was written

1168
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,511
The book of the fictional Novella about

1169
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:15,071
Virginia were pissed off about Texas so they started

1170
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Interesting

1171
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,191
If you go on Amazon you'll find this review with the headline

1172
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
Pretty silly

1173
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,871
A cheap short novel Revolution

1174
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
Anarchist

1175
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Fantasy

1176
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
Shallow and uninformed

1177
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:38,111
Jefferson quote or two thrown in for good measure

1178
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,439
Amazon reviewer knows more about Thomas Jefferson

1179
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
F****** Alex

1180
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,767
Who claims Jefferson is one of his Heroes

1181
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Defense

1182
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,191
It possible that reviewer could have worked at the Thomas

1183
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:56,543
There's if there's a real right we don't know

1184
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,359
Read everything

1185
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Perhaps

1186
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Showing up

1187
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,319
Tell you more about this guy

1188
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
I really thought that was this guy is the gift that keeps giving

1189
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
What's up late last night

1190
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
This is so much more about him

1191
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,863
Figured out like

1192
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,263
What this guy is about 90

1193
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,359
That's only the stage being set at exactly

1194
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,175
Exactly

1195
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:42,623
Okay here we go into the shop

Too fast I have a really

1203
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,711
Itchy trigger fingers

1204
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,295
I've lost a few few friends were in the military

1205
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:48,159
Go to Quick align elifi your argument the best assault for me to shoot you so

1206
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,231
Self-defense

1207
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,863
Kessler talks about

1208
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,423
The world

1209
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,263
And I've been contacted by The Oath Keepers

1210
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,615
Pennsylvania

1211
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
912 guys

1212
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
Remember strong throughout the country

1213
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:27,583
912 that's where Glenn Baxter to Target sell co-sleepers a tea party adjacent

1214
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
He's just a big Tea Party Guy

1215
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
I should be known about him

1216
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:37,055
I cannot stress this enough literally in

1217
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,455
He's just yelling horrible s*** about people and then firing of a semi-automatic rifle

1218
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:44,991
At like a pile of dirt

1219
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,271
It's insane

1220
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:51,903
He's just screaming about like the UN needs to go away and

1221
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
Wild

1222
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
Free viral

1223
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,511
Back in like 20-30

1224
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
But like

1225
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,303
There

1226
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,631
Dave give you the appearance of a man on him

1227
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,727
So it's like the Clint Eastwood's lecturing Obama

1228
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,007
As a chair

1229
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,663
Except he has a gun that he's firing at the chair after yelling

1230
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
Is too old to yell

1231
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,503
Racist movie

1232
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,343
Visa Direct

1233
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,591
Whoever shoots first loses

1234
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,663
We want to see

1235
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:55,903
If you want

1236
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,207
Physically

1237
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,815
Correct. You're right on point there more

1238
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:09,471
Do you understand even kind of aggressive in a little bit violent

1239
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
Do they take your guns or when they're

1240
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,335
We got to do this before they even start

1241
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,991
Where do

1242
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
But I should tell you

1243
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:29,951
But if you're not political now there's no way you're going to be violent later so if you want to prove that you're ready to be violent

1244
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:33,791
Political weird sort of turtle to it

1245
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,095
I don't really understand

1246
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,119
I don't know if it's

1247
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,167
Like anything I would label is like

1248
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
Eva LaRue

1249
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Weird

1250
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
We don't allow anybody into our militia

1251
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Who is

1252
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
Also put a

1253
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
Gun control

1254
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,687
That would also abolish the fat

1255
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,991
If you don't do that

1256
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
The Throwdown

1257
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Yeah

1258
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
Movies playing

1259
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
To nullify laws

1260
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
And all that good stuff

1261
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,975
Yes it's really not

1262
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
There's no substance

1263
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,119
Hey.

1264
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,959
Globalist occupied government is doing a bunch of stuff that we

1265
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,031
Fuel is illegal

1266
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
There's much more important issue

1267
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,759
Like the fact

1268
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
Kessler's Maher supports

1269
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:41,887
I hope everybody gets behind

1270
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Marilu Henner

1271
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,239
She's pro-second Amendment she standing behind me on this

1272
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,567
She can also push the council into adopting this

1273
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,407
And I just really hope

1274
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
That's interested

1275
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,783
Already

1276
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,439
Interesting to hear that Mary Lou Henner

1277
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
The mayor supports

1278
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
Is a perfect

1279
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,167
Story WhatsApp horrible career

1280
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,775
In 2011 he was sued by councilman Robert Wagner

1281
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
A counselor arrested

1282
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
Strip search

1283
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
Handheld Wagner in prison

1284
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,383
6 hours

1285
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
What hat what is

1286
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,063
He left a voicemail on a machine which he admitted quote wasn't pretty

1287
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
Wagner called Kessler

1288
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719
TVs in front of

1289
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
But he couldn't reach

1290
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,583
And left a message that got a little bit

1291
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
From Neighbors

1292
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
Carrollton

1293
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,751
City Council

1294
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,519
Some Squad

1295
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,871
Wagner swore good bit in the voicemail

1296
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,991
He wasn't threatening or verbally harassing the mayor or Kessler in any

1297
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,807
There's a pretty open-and-shut case of Abby

1298
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,879
Powersport Kessler very literally arrested

1299
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
For exercising

1300
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
First Amendment rights

1301
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,231
What year was awarded $15,000

1302
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,583
Both

1303
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,935
Sportscaster because she's Justice

1304
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
Is f***** up is he

1305
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,823
It's not clear whether or not you directed Kessler to arrest Wagner but it is clear that you

1306
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
She signed off on me rest

1307
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
Which is completely without probable cause

1308
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
Constitute

1309
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,943
Purelyhr Italian

1310
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,479
So what was the

1311
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,063
I mean I know why

1312
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,135
Arresting him for harassment

1313
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,815
Hey guys just harassment

1314
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:52,447
Is Ebony year-and-a-half before he's appearing here as a guest on Alex's show

1315
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
And holding them up as an example

1316
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,751
Full of someone who's going to

1317
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,055
Constitution

1318
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,871
Literally example of a corrupt cop

1319
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
Position to deny someone else

1320
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
Their constitutional right

1321
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,735
Over pettiness

1322
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
And just him flexing

1323
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,831
Port of call Gilbert

1324
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
Nick Cage.

1325
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:17,279
Interview relay

1326
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,823
What makes appearances

1327
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,895
This guy is Kessler on the Alex Jones Show

1328
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,223
Is that about a year after he got fired is gilberton

1329
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,527
Kessler

1330
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
To doing some bread Rehabilitation

1331
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
By claiming that is

1332
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,903
Videos where only made

1333
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,975
As part of an undercover operation he was involved with the Fed

1334
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,375
Love it I love what they were trying to do

1335
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Which was

1336
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,471
Appeared on Fox News Radio

1337
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:02,335
I was sent out for what I can't really say exactly

1338
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,175
Weather

1339
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,015
I can what I can do to find out who's who and what's what amount

1340
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,111
These groups groups I'm talking about Second Amendment

1341
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,159
Group militia groups

1342
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
All sorts of

1343
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
He told comes that he didn't

1344
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,583
So he was playing the law

1345
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:31,263
He's been embedded in 20 years something like that

1346
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:44,063
Videos of We lured out some dangerous element so I can publicly declare on

1347
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,087
Snitch

1348
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,671
Final video of him standing in front of a

1349
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,975
Mission accomplished Banner

1350
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,255
Crazy

1351
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:57,375
Is literally insane but this guy is like now's work with the fan

1352
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:00,703
Love the swing for the fences you got to give

1353
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Swing for the fence

1354
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,775
I love it I love it when you just

1355
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
Really go all out

1356
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,591
I have dog whistle

1357
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,687
Just say that you've never even heard of Assange

1358
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,503
Give me the Home Run I don't believe this guy at all

1359
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,551
I don't believe any of this

1360
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,855
I think he's 100%

1361
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
About working

1362
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
Stop that.

1363
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
Videos

1364
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,791
But his story about being undercover working for the feds

1365
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,351
This is just his way of trying to save

1366
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,399
She was trying to work

1367
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,447
Hangouts

1368
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,495
Reality show that

1369
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Signed contract for

1370
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Wasn't happening

1371
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,335
He wasn't making any money

1372
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,039
I just think it's really funny though like no matter what even if he is lying

1373
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
He is

1374
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,367
Like if you go through message boards

1375
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,647
All of these like

1376
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,463
Communities

1377
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,303
F****** snitch

1378
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:05,471
Right exactly

1379
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,775
Interesting to because like I don't believe them

1380
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,823
But if you do

1381
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,615
I bet he was working too

1382
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
To root out

1383
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
People who are dangerous

1384
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:19,295
Part of being on Alex Jones Show might be part of that Outreach

1385
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:26,207
Might be trying to ensnare dangerous people

1386
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,255
If we're going to do it let's do it man

1387
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,303
Nowell no

1388
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,839
List of

1389
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,191
Suspects and arrests that came about as in as part of this investigation

1390
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:41,055
10 + 5

1391
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,151
Is this the only thing that makes

1392
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
Stop Believin

1393
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:48,991
What's 100%

1394
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,575
But makes it more robust than just I was making

1395
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
Videos where I shot thing

1396
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,671
How you lower dangerous people

1397
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,975
Is that he was trying to build a militia

1398
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,815
The idea is that like that call for people to join

1399
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
That's how you was fine

1400
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,751
25

1401
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Itsfunneh

1402
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:22,783
Alex Goes Nova covers in the future when he's on out

1403
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,391
Stuff that happened before the time he's on Elsa show

1404
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:31,487
You really should get a sense of like this guy no no no no no no no

1405
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Through and see what his record is

1406
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,143
Started out like

1407
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,679
Ballistic Sheriff

1408
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
Things better

1409
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
First partner with Denzel

1410
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,943
Point of order

1411
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:57,343
Gilbert

1412
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,207
No it's the county not the burrow

1413
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
Episode

1414
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,095
He starts to get some calls

1415
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
The news for people

1416
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,679
Illinois

1417
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:16,543
Legislation

1418
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,847
But much like snakes

1419
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
Hi there reintroducing

1420
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,199
This is an emergency

1421
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:52,127
These people are criminals

1422
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:54,431
Because this is a dirty trick flow

1423
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
If you know any history of Illinois

1424
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:03,391
Say they're going to they're going to bring the general assembly succession in the house tonight at 5

1425
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:17,983
Rainbow

1426
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:24,895
Federal Reserve

1427
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,223
Next flip

1428
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:35,647
Remember Joseph fair when it came on your show and he talked about how he was afraid that

1429
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:40,255
Barack Obama and his controller zagline people up and basically do away with him

1430
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:46,655
Remember how you played on The Heirs

1431
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:54,079
Barack Obama is a hard-core communist, understands power

1432
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Why

1433
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,639
Are you saying that

1434
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,175
Alex

1435
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:03,295
Eli has told Obama

1436
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
True

1437
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:11,487
Search Larry Graham.

1438
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
Relation to that at all

1439
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
It's just a line it's me again

1440
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
Bill Ayers

1441
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,471
Alex tried to ask Bill about

1442
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
The situation of Hazzard today is homely

1443
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
This is ridiculous

1444
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,967
Cuz even the real version of it wouldn't like

1445
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
If Alex wanted

1446
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Just report

1447
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
Whatever his

1448
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,343
The fake version

1449
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,671
Larry

1450
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
You can say that

1451
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
The FBI Files include

1452
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,351
Bill Ayers Towing

1453
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
It's just like three layers of lies and have had the opportunity while the Weather Underground was

1454
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,591
Being investigated like this

1455
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,663
No idea

1456
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
It's not

1457
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,039
So we're going to

1458
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
Already

1459
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
They want more

1460
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,975
It's earlier Alex

1461
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,023
Is the Thomas Jefferson quote

1462
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,071
It turns out that everybody

1463
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Kind of does that

1464
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Exit

1465
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375

His voice over guy of God

1468

Every form of tyranny

1469
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:40,319
Thomas Jefferson Alex Jones net worth

1470
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,903
The context of that quote is about like being against

1471
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
Religious

1472
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
The idea of the church

1473
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:51,071
Thomas Jefferson's quote

1474
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,655
What about the church

1475
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
It wasn't about

1476
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,239
It wasn't anything like that it was

1477
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,055
This is also a form of tyranny over the mind of man

1478
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,847
And I have sworn Eternal vigil

1479
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,919
Yeah so everybody's kind of whack over there

Insane like I would

1487
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,463
I want to see a documentary on

1489
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,095
Lunacy

1490
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,375
Absolutely

1491
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,703
Don't get reported or probably the most

1492
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Awful

1493
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,007
Pirate weird

1494
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,871
You know we're only at like

1495
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Through this

1496
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,319
I feel like we should do something we haven't done in a long time

1497
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
And that is

1498
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,159
I realize that we have

1499
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
What

1500
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,863
I didn't we have some messages from the from the phone

1501
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,263

1502
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,151
I feel terrible about that

1503
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,943

What's the bird for a little while

1513
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,575
The world would be a much better place

1514
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,671
Everything always tell your sister every time Ted Anderson is on the show

1515
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Picturing like

1516
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,791
Mitch McConnell mixed with like Doug Dimmadome

1517
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
Anyway

1518
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,631
I love your work and I love you

1519
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
I think she's right on the bird feeder

1520
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,543
Readers to solve the problems of nothing

Creative Solutions for problems that have been going on for a long time

1522

1524
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
Cedar's forbath

1527
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,399
For people who are curious if you ever want to call it

1528
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,983
I'm not sure if we're going to be having the time cuz generally UPS

1529
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
Tokyo pretty long

1530
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
So I know

1531
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,615
I haven't listened to any of you

1532
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,431
So I don't know

1533
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
A tune-up

1534
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:58,975
Hey Jordan guess what it turns out that messages that are more than a month old getting erased automatically Buy

1535
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:11,775
So much for our plan on going over

1536
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,640
Old messages

1537
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,944
I'm sorry

1538
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760

01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,512
Absolutely

1541
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,584
Are these are the guys from

1542
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
We're not going to enforce

1543
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,168
The gun laws that

1544
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,192
Washington

1545
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,984
Just passed are they just doing the same

1546
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
Kessler thing

1547
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,616
I don't know I don't know enough about this

1548
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,664
Specifics but maybe it's their Kessler right

1549
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,968
Like the the Constitutional Sheriff

1550
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,992
Movement or whatever

1551
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,344
Over that accept together

1552
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
A sheriff after

1553
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,096
I could do that again

1554
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,632
So give me more

1555
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,680
Give me more places to

1556
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
That's what I love to do

1557
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Bunch of assholes

1558
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
Yep

1559
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:23,968
So if you are 1530 neon nip

1560
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:30,624
We will hopefully do this again to actually open up Skype

1561
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
From time to time

1562
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,256
This was a little bit shorter but I'm glad

1563
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
To do something that's

1564
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
Not about

1565
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,352
Presence

1566
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Google Talk

1567
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,400
Map

1568
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,728
Oh yeah

1569
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,032
Dickhole police chief

1570
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
From Pennsylvania

1571
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,824
Who

1572
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,872
Is just

1573
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,896
That

1574
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
Story of him

1575
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,712
Being passed

1576
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,040
Like screaming obscenities at the lady

1577
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,112
And about to drive away and then

1578
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
Because you can

1579
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,720
Can hear the wheels turning in that story of him being like

1580
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,512
I bet she's not threatened

1581
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,840
Maybe I need to pull out a gun

1582
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,376
And make sure that she gets

1583
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,192
The message

1584
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:19,520
Allegedly I don't know how that case

1585
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:24,128
I don't know I couldn't tell from the article that I

1586
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,408
Whatever

1587
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,456
But

1588
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,784
It's f***** up

1589
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
There are

1590
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
Sounds like

1591
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,672
Yeah and a lot of them

1592
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,488
Don't have someone like him as their own

1593
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,768
Thank God

1594
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
Stories out there that we

1595
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
We just never here

1596
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
And that sounds like

1597
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
Towns that have

1598
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,008
The f****** police chief

1599
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
Who is that

1600
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:55,360
Real power hungry

1601
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,408
Power

1602
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,480
To I don't know whether it's enriched himself or like

1603
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
Crush

1604
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
Mild descent

1605
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
Or whatever

1606
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:10,464
Corruption that went under Joe arpaio's Iron Fist

1607
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:16,096
There is an interview this guy Kessler

1608
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,376
Cold Case

1609
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
Joe Arpaio

1610
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,128
About Joe

1611
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,944
Before we heard about it

1612
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,808
That was a large enough

1613
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,344
Place for people to

1614
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Attention

1615
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,136
At least he had a

1616
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,720
Group of police officers working

1617
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:47,840
Yeah

1618
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,984
You just like to imagine that everything runs well and you know like we have all these

1619
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,520
Some place that are great

1620

Is it Robert Blake

1643
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,704
Cuz that would also make sense.

1644
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,872
Councilman Robert Wagner has never killed any

1645
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
As best I can tell you just

1646
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
Strip search
